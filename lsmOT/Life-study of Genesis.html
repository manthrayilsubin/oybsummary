<h1 class="title" data-content-id="CAIiqFyjjgw0LbNxWLi5D94b-wSGcXq_WajUO0fMiI1qsIetqtq6bkTvknnO7bFYb">GENESIS—THE GENERAL SKETCH<br/>AND CENTRAL THOUGHT</h1><p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KaZzlnQL7e1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> Praise the Lord for the Bible! Praise the Lord for the life, the divine life, the eternal life, which is contained in this Book! And praise the Lord that He has afforded us this opportunity to have a life-study of His divine Word with such a large congregation! The Lord willing, starting from today, April 6, 1974, we shall continue this life-study through the Bible, book after book, consecutively every weekend. May the Lord grant us His dear presence with His rich anointing all the way through our study. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_SQQ1CeJgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds">A WONDERFUL BOOK</h2><p data-content-id="prNfLWZ9JdrW7yTc3YS3U_Pb_rVmoK-lAf5XbjI5e4-Pr6RDr_aquY_gO4K9YJN2U"> The Bible is a wonderful book. It is “The Book” among all books! It took 1600 years to complete, starting with Moses, the greatest prophet of God, and ending with the Apostle John. It was confirmed 300 years later (397 A.D.) at a council held at Carthage in North Africa. Not long after that, the Bible was locked away from the people by the Catholic Church. For nearly a thousand years, from the 6th century through the 15th century, the Bible was locked up. History calls this period the Dark Ages. Human society became dark because the Bible, containing all the divine light, was locked away from humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="vGPkFtfe7Aen3iGIVhF4Dc2jr5hhJoSKHjShQRi-Q6TFheMiOa11sXw6WrcmFYS61"> Then, in the Reformation, God used Martin Luther to unlock the Bible. At the same time, printing was invented, allowing the Bible to be printed. Although the Bible was unlocked, it was not so open. Yet, we thank the Lord that during the past five centuries He has opened up His Word <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> again and again through many great teachers. We stand on their shoulders and we are grateful to them. Yet, how we thank the Lord that today the Bible is so open to us, allowing us to have a rich life-study of the living Word. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3OhkPD2bcrDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12">THE BREATH OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQIl_6dSpG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> What is the Bible? We know that the word “Bible” means “the Book.” But what is this book? The Bible itself says, “All Scripture is God-breathed” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26174" data-verses="2Timothy 3:16">2 Tim. 3:16</span>). The Bible is the breath of God. It is not merely the word or the thought of God, but the very breath of God. Whatever we breathe out is our breath, and this breath proceeds out of our being. So the Bible as the breath of God is something breathed out of the being of God. The Bible contains the very element of God. Whatever God is, is contained in this divine book. God is light, life, love, power, wisdom, and many other items. All these items of what God is have been breathed out into the Bible. Whenever we come to this book with an open heart and an open spirit, we can immediately touch something divine: not just thoughts, concepts, knowledge, words, or sentences, but something deeper than all these things. We touch God Himself. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8AfonztgcnOuNK4c1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq">THE SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6vWL5kNlWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> The Lord Jesus said that the words He speaks are spirit and life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26175" data-verses="John 6:63">John 6:63</span>). Can we imagine that the Bible as the Word of God is the Spirit? It is not simply words in black and white; it is something higher, deeper, fuller, and richer—that is the Spirit and life. And the Bible tells us that the Spirit is God Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26176" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span>), and that life is Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26177" data-verses="John 14:6">John 14:6</span>). I do not say that the Bible is God Himself, but, according to the Lord Jesus, the word in the Bible is the Spirit, and the Spirit is God Himself, the Lord who is life to us. When we come to contact the Word, if we are right in our position and open in our heart and spirit, we will surely contact God Himself and receive life. </p>
<p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWjy9m4trAfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> When we come to the divine Word, nearly our whole being is involved. We must come with a heart which seeks after God, with a clear, sober mind, and with an open spirit. If we open our spirit to God and to His Word, we can touch <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> God Himself behind the printed page. It is not just a matter of reading with our eyes, understanding with our mind, or seeking with our heart; it is also a matter of touching God in our spirit. If we exercise our whole being in this way, we not only receive a revelation, but some divine element revealed and conveyed by His Word will be transmitted into our spirit. So, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26178" data-verses="Ephesians 6:17-18">Ephesians 6:17-18</span> says that we have to “receive...the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition...” We should take the word of the Bible not only by reading and studying, but also “by means of all prayer.” We should read and study the Bible prayerfully; that is, we must exercise our spirit to contact the Lord by prayer with the reading of the divine Word. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXkUv9gNWQwrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip">THE MAIN REVELATION IN THE BIBLE</h2><p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LmYUqaAXyrZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> In the Bible mainly life is revealed. Life is the focus of the whole Bible. But <em>what</em> is life, or <em>who</em> is life? The answer is in the word of the Lord Jesus. He says, “I am life,” and “I am come that you may have life.” The Bible is a revelation of Christ as life. Whenever we come to the Bible, we must realize that we are coming to contact Christ as our life. </p>
<p data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtqIGgiLr__u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m"> The whole Bible is a book of life, and this life is nothing less than the divine and living Person of Christ Jesus Himself, who is our portion. When we come to the Bible, we must come to contact Him. We should not repeat the pitiful history of the Jewish people who researched the Scriptures because they thought there was life in them, yet would not come to the Lord Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26179" data-verses="John 5:39-40">John 5:39-40</span>). We should not contact the Bible without contacting the Lord. Whenever we open the Bible we have to say, “Lord Jesus, You have to be here. This is not merely a book, this is Your revelation. I don’t like to read this book without contacting You. I don’t like to hear something from this book without hearing You. I don’t like to read this book without seeing You. I like to see Your face. I like to see what You are from the printed page. O Lord Jesus, enlighten Your Word and anoint every line that I may touch You.” We need such a spirit to contact this living Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="6CXs4WE0BL6-B1B4FDiAFrJIue3HzGKjTYJeRnGmeXBe72gXmUfpgBoC9qhDjO81n"> After man was created, he was put in front of two trees in the garden of Eden: one was the tree of life and the other was <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> the tree of knowledge. If man had eaten the tree of life he would have received the divine life of God that was indicated by the tree of life. But man was tempted and took the tree of knowledge that denoted the source other than God, that is Satan. The issue of that was death. The principle is the same in our contact with the Bible. We may take the Bible as a book of life by contacting it with our spirit, by praying to the Lord that we may receive Him as life through His Word, or we may make the Bible a book of knowledge by contacting it merely with our mind, seeking knowledge in letters. This brings us death, not life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26180" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:6">Second Corinthians 3:6</span> warns us that “the letter [that is, the scripture in letters] kills, but the Spirit gives life.” We shouldn’t make the Bible merely a book of letters to kill us. We have to take the Bible by contacting the Lord Spirit that it may be the Spirit and life to us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="R_GfdTPWaEiXNNW82-yDaXF_DhuyLG6UWYb4K416h7Rart6vExDqqOyU38XwPBejO">OTHER FUNCTIONS OF THE BIBLE</h2><p data-content-id="sHB9QAVlSM3v0XjManno-mA4rmH3fHA5fTkqfQSTHo75EQs1z1Iu7LXCJgPqSPnNs"> In addition, we have some verses which tell us that the Bible has many other functions. The Bible has the wisdom which can help us to be saved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26181" data-verses="2Timothy 3:15">2 Tim. 3:15</span>). It has the producing function of a seed. Through the Word of the Bible we can be reborn, regenerated (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26182" data-verses="1Peter 1:23">1 Pet. 1:23</span>). After the new birth, the Word of the Bible is milk and food to us that we may be nourished to grow in the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26183" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">1 Pet. 2:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26184" data-verses="Matthew 4:4">Matt. 4:4</span>). So, we must eat the Word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26185" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:16">Jer. 15:16</span>), that is, take the Word into us by exercising our spirit over the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XQ7pLdprow1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW"> Also, the Bible can give us the best teaching and perfect the man of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26186" data-verses="Romans 15:4">Rom. 15:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26187" data-verses="2Timothy 3:16-17">2 Tim. 3:16-17</span>). If we belong to the Lord and desire to be perfect, we can surely receive perfection through His divine Word. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="LD01-v3um3NuLShGttlViq2WnWLERg9jsTHcyuTXlEDKbBHncuqREEkOSwGaFv9xn">THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><p data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD0X-d0C7ziWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP"> The Bible is composed of two Testaments, the Old and the New. The Old Testament is mainly a prediction of Christ, predicting the coming Christ in plain words, shadows, types, and many figures. </p>

<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6P6Zaamr9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> We come to the matter of Satan’s rebellion and corruption. That we should now study this subject may come as a surprise. We have been considering God’s creation and suddenly we turn to Satan’s rebellion. What does this mean? We must approach this matter with a sober mind in order that we may be crystal clear. </p>
<p data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjI9EH9nBcGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD"> Many good Christians think that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26229" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span> is the subject of the first two chapters of Genesis. They were taught that these two chapters are a record of God’s creation, and that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26230" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapter 1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26231" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">verse 1</span> is the subject. But if <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26232" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">verse 1</span> is the subject, how can <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26233" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">verse 2</span> start with “and”? “And” means that something is going on already, and then something else happens to follow it. “And” is a conjunction which combines two things: the first thing goes and the second thing comes. Even the grammar shows that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26234" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">verse 1</span> is not the subject, but part of the description. It describes the first event in a series. “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, and....” This means that after God created, something happened. </p>
<p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qdGRIwbJdzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, and the earth became waste and empty.” The Concordant Version of Genesis translates the verse this way: “Yet the earth became a chaos and vacant.” The Concordant Version does not say “and”; it says “yet.” “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Yet the earth became a chaos and vacant.” A chaos is a mess. The earth became a chaos—waste and vacant. If you build some apartments and no one dwells <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> in them, they are vacant. We may render this phrase as either “a chaos and vacant” or “waste and empty.” Something happened between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26235" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">verse 1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26236" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">verse 2</span> which caused the earth to become waste and empty. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="aGZQhn44RfDLbiYsGGvVESIgVp6HKCGvuVmdAiPygWOGRgcCG0VL2WETay77K2O7o">a. The Origin of Satan</h2><p data-content-id="bdPZiOYGTI0GDMWc0r7m5RvsNEaZCY4FzwTm0_1hM378LkILri-YBA6MHtvxUHmDQ"> Satan was an angel created by God before He created the earth. The book of Job (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26237" data-verses="Job 38:4-7">38:4-7</span>) tells us that when God laid the measure of the foundation of the earth, the sons of God (the angels) shouted for joy. This proves that God created the angels before He created the earth. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26238" data-verses="Ezekiel 28:1">Ezekiel 28</span> we see that Satan was not only one of the angels, but the highest archangel, the head of all the angels. </p>
<p data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYQqskVksNMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26239" data-verses="Ezekiel 28:1">Ezekiel 28</span> describes Satan’s position in the universe before his rebellion and corruption. This whole chapter seems to speak about the king of Tyre. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26240" data-verses="Ezekiel 28:13">verse 13</span> says, “Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God.” If we read the context, we can see that this was not the Eden in which Adam was put. This Eden was not on the earth, but in the heavens, on the holy mountain of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZgwvrVFAp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6"> “Every precious stone was thy covering.” He was covered with precious stones. G. H. Pember says that this indicates his dwelling place. His dwelling was of precious stones. </p>
<p data-content-id="BLE5KA_UJUWmNHemF8RznMimercB0O1klPDPPz_cM4ETPjCdTs_KDy-6YMjsxBV2U"> “The service of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared with thee in the day thou wast created” (Heb.). In the ancient times, musical instruments such as tambourines and pipes were for kings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26241" data-verses="Daniel 3:5">Dan. 3:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26242" data-verses="Daniel 6:18">6:18</span>). This indicates that Satan was a king, holding the highest position in that universe. This was why even the Lord Jesus called him “the ruler of this world” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26243" data-verses="John 12:31">John 12:31</span>). The Apostle also calls him “the ruler of the authority of the air” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26244" data-verses="Ephesians 2:2">Eph. 2:2</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26245" data-verses="Luke 4:5-6">Luke 4:5-6</span> also confirms this. “And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in a moment of time. And the Devil said to Him, To You I will give all this authority and their glory, because to me it has been delivered, and to whomever I want I give it.” Was this a lie? If it was a lie the Lord Jesus surely would have rebuked Satan. Since the Lord did not rebuke him, it must be a fact. Satan, the Devil, told the Lord that all the kingdoms of the world and all their glory had been <span class="pg" data-page-id="15" id="15">[15]</span> delivered to him. Satan also said, “to whomever I want I give it.” When did God deliver all of this to Satan? This was definitely something pre-Adamic, before the world of Adam. By reading the full revelation of the Bible, we can realize that God did appoint Satan the head of that universe, and that God had delivered all created things in the heaven and on the earth into his hand. So he became “the ruler of this world.” His position and rank were so high that even “Michael the archangel...did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26246" data-verses="Jude 1:9">Jude 9</span>). Michael is one of the archangels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26247" data-verses="Daniel 10:13">Dan. 10:13</span>). His daring not to rebuke Satan proves that Satan’s rank must be even higher than his. Thus, we can infer that Satan must be the highest archangel. </p>
<p data-content-id="x52sBK0RPP8CO8qDhR2srrPetnwO0DNKTmsXdJCAVgGjfw6s5s9H5KtPnduIvZkRU"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26248" data-verses="Ezekiel 28:14">Verse 14</span>: “Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth.” Satan was “the anointed cherub that covereth.” This probably means that he covered (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26249" data-verses="Exodus 25:20">Exo. 25:20</span>) the ark of God in the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26250" data-verses="Revelation 11:19">Rev. 11:19</span>). “And I have set thee so.” God did this. God anointed and appointed the archangel to cover His ark. Ezekiel tells us that the cherubim bear God’s glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26251" data-verses="Ezekiel 9:3">9:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26252" data-verses="Ezekiel 10:18">10:18</span>) and that they are very close to God’s throne (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26253" data-verses="Ezekiel 10:1">10:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26254" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:26">1:26</span>). This shows that Satan, before his rebellion, when he was the anointed cherub covering God’s ark, must have been very close to God, bearing God’s glory. Ezekiel also tells us that the cherubim are the four living creatures which are of special use to God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26255" data-verses="Ezekiel 10:20">10:20</span>). Also the four living creatures in Ezekiel are similar to the four in Revelation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26256" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:10">Ezek. 1:10</span>, cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26257" data-verses="Revelation 4:7">Rev. 4:7</span>) which took the lead among the creatures in worshipping God. This reveals that today’s Satan, God’s adversary, originally the anointed cherub, must have been specially appointed by God to be the head among His creatures, bearing His glory and leading them to worship Him. This may indicate that the anointed archangel also had the priesthood. He might have been the high priest in the universal worship of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2MhWInStiDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> “Thou wast upon the holy mountain of God.” This certainly must be in the heavens. “Thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26258" data-verses="Exodus 24:10">Exodus 24:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26259" data-verses="Exodus 24:17">17</span>, Moses, Aaron, and many others saw under God’s throne some precious stones with the glory of God like burning fire. That <span class="pg" data-page-id="16" id="16">[16]</span> must be the stones of fire. From this we may infer that the anointed cherub was also specially privileged to move in the realm where God’s glory was. </p>
<p data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQciVHrojFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B"> Beside <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26260" data-verses="Ezekiel 28:1">Ezekiel 28</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26261" data-verses="Isaiah 14:12">Isaiah 14:12</span> also helps us to see Satan’s origin. It tells us that Satan was the “Daystar [for Lucifer according to Hebrew], son of the morning.” Just as the daystar is the leading one among the stars, so Satan must be the head of all the angels. The title “son of the morning” shows that he was there early, in the morning of the universe. Thus, Satan, from the earliest days of the universe, was the head of the angels, bright as the daystar. </p>
<p data-content-id="QMSNPOcCBLw6v-EOydvwYFV9IvojduX4YH5_O01lRUzkJdbjHu_x8PZ2HwO74uIjb"> Satan’s origin was wonderful. He was God’s anointed cherub, the one closest to God, holding the highest position in God’s creation. He had not only the kingship, but also the priesthood, the very position that we, God’s redeemed people, have forever (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26262" data-verses="Revelation 5:9-10">Rev. 5:9-10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26263" data-verses="Revelation 20:4-6">20:4-6</span>). But he was deprived of his position and offices when he rebelled against God. Now God has chosen us to be His priests and kings, to take over Satan’s position and offices, to put him to shame, and to glorify God. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7Wmreel3J3ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo">b. The Rebellion of Satan</h2><p data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKQhicn3gfCaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26264" data-verses="Ezekiel 28:15">Ezekiel 28:15</span> says that Satan was perfect in his ways from the day he was created. Of course, God didn’t create an evil Satan. God created a good and perfect archangel. But at a certain time, this archangel, the anointed cherub, rebelled against God. </p>

Keep these five items in mind. After the earth was judged due to Satan’s rebellion, it became waste and empty. </p>
<p data-content-id="x52sBK0RPP8CO8qDhR2srrPatmUq0DNKTmsXdJCAVgGjfw6s5s9H5KtPnduIvZkRU"> Darkness is another indication of judgment. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26349" data-verses="Exodus 10:21-22">Exodus 10:21-22</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26350" data-verses="Revelation 16:10">Revelation 16:10</span> show that darkness is a result of God’s judgment. There was darkness when God exercised His judgment upon Pharaoh, and there will be darkness when He exercises His judgment over the antichrist. Thus, the darkness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26351" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">Genesis 1:2a</span> points to God’s judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2MhSIlGViDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> In addition, we know that light accompanies life and that darkness always signifies death. Where life is, there is light; where death is, there is darkness. The reverse is also true: where there is darkness, there is death. Thus, the darkness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26352" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">Genesis 1:2</span> also signifies that the earth was under a condition of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQciRHpsfFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B"> The word “deep” means the deep water. In the Bible, water has two meanings and symbolizes two different things, one <span class="pg" data-page-id="26" id="26">[26]</span> positive and the other negative. In the positive sense, water always signifies something living. The flowing water brings life to people and quenches their thirst. In the negative sense, water signifies death. For instance, when we were baptized in water, that water represented death. Also, the waters of the Red Sea and the waters of the River Jordan both represent death. The water mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26353" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">Genesis 1:2</span> doesn’t represent life, but indicates death. Therefore, we conclude that the earth was under death. The earth not only was waste, empty, and meaningless, but was filled with death and was under death. In the midst of this situation, God came in. </p>

God was going to restore what had been damaged, and was going to have some further creation. For instance, this time God created man. Man was a being created by God, not a being restored by God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26356" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">Genesis 1:2b</span>—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26357" data-verses="Genesis 2:25">2:25</span> is a portion of the divine Word showing us God’s restoration of the damaged universe, plus His further creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="LD01-v3um3NuLShGttlViq2enW7MRg9jsTHcyuTXlEDKbBHncuqREEkOSwGaFv9xn"> We need to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26358" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">chapter two</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26359" data-verses="Genesis 2:4">verse 4</span>. “These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.” Most people pay little attention to this verse; yet, it is very meaningful. It shows us both God’s original creation and God’s restoration. The first half of the verse says, “...the heavens and the earth when they were created....” Notice that the heavens are mentioned first and then the earth, and that the verb used here is “created.” The second half of the verse says, “...in the day that the Lord God made....” Here, the verb has been changed from “created” to “made.” As we have pointed out in the first message, to create means to produce something out of nothing, and to make means to work upon an existing substance in order to produce something else out of it. We need to see that originally the heavens and the earth were created. Then the second half of the verse <span class="pg" data-page-id="27" id="27">[27]</span> says, “...in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.” Have you noticed the change in the sequence? First, God <em>created</em> the heavens and the earth; then, He <em>made</em> the earth and the heavens. </p>
<p data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD0X-V0CL7iWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26360" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span> God created. “In the beginning God created [firstly] the heavens and [then] the earth.” Then, from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26361" data-verses="Genesis 1:3">verse 3</span> to the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26362" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapter one</span>, the Lord made the earth and the heavens. “...the Lord made the earth and the heavens” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26363" data-verses="Genesis 2:4">Gen. 2:4b</span>). If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26364" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapter 1</span> again, we can see that on the third day the Lord recovered the earth. God did not create the earth, for it was there already, submerged beneath the waters. So the Lord recovered the earth on the third day. Also, on the fourth day, the Lord recovered the sky, that is the heavens. Thus, in the restoration, it was not the heavens and the earth; it was firstly the earth, and then the heavens. But in the creation, it was firstly the heavens and then the earth. We can see both of these things in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26365" data-verses="Genesis 2:4">Genesis 2:4</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROmLT5TljOOlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX"> As we have pointed out strongly in the first message, the first two chapters of Genesis appear to be a record of God’s creation, but the underlying thought is completely a matter of life. This is why some people consider that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26366" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapters one and two</span> of Genesis are too simple, too brief, to be a record of creation. We agree. As a record of God’s creation, it is too simple. But we know that the Bible is not a record of creation, neither a record of history, nor a record of any stories. The Bible is completely a book of life. The whole Bible is focused on life. If we read the first chapter of Genesis carefully and have light from the Holy Spirit, we can realize that it is absolutely a chapter of life. It was written from the point of view of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9BnLBhLAW6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr"> You may say that the word “life” is not found in this chapter. This is true. Nevertheless, we can find many items pertaining to life. When God recovered the earth on the third day, all kinds of plant life were produced. Then came the animal life in the water, the animal life in the air, the animal life on the earth, the human life, and ultimately the divine life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26367" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">chapter 2</span>. Hallelujah! Life is the focus of these two chapters. From this perspective, we can surely understand the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26368" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>. <span class="pg" data-page-id="28" id="28">[28]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KaZztnRfze1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> God’s original creation was damaged by Satan’s rebellion and then judged by God Himself. After God’s judgment, there remained nothing except darkness upon the surface of the deep water. This signifies a death condition. In the midst of this death condition, the Bible suddenly says, “And the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters.” Isn’t this wonderful? The Spirit was brooding. Hallelujah! “The Spirit was brooding” as a hen broods over her eggs in order to produce little chickens. When the Bible first says something about the Spirit, it doesn’t say “the power of the Spirit,” “the might of the Spirit,” but it says that the “Spirit of God was brooding over the surface of the waters.” This means that He was preparing to generate life. We need to see that the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26369" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> is something related to life, to God’s gospel, and to spiritual things. For this we have a strong proof in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26370" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>. Paul says, “God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts for the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.” This certainly was a reference to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26371" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapter one</span> of Genesis. By this one verse, we can realize that everything recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26372" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> must be related to life, to God’s shining, and to God’s gospel. Based upon this verse, we need to interpret everything according to life. </p>
<p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_SQY1DaFgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> We need to recall our condition before we were saved. We were just waste and empty, our lives were meaningless, and we were covered with darkness. Within us was an abyss, a bottomless pit. And in this abyss was a swarm of demons, driving us to lose our temper, to gamble, to go to the movies, and to do many other evil things. We were waste and empty, yet full of darkness and death. </p>
<p data-content-id="prNfLWZ9JdrW7yTc3YS3U_PT_qROoK-lAf5XbjI5e4-Pr6RDr_aquY_gO4K9YJN2U"> But, hallelujah! One day, some living One began to hover over us, to work within our heart, to brood upon the death and the deep within us. This was not something psychological or ethical, but the living One working within us, working so gently, lovingly, like a big hen brooding over the eggs in her <span class="pg" data-page-id="29" id="29">[29]</span> nest. This is the brooding and the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit. </p>

The Spirit came, the Word of God came, and the light came. As a result of this, there were three separations: light was separated from darkness; the waters above were separated from the waters below; and the dry land was separated from the death waters. By these three separations the dry land emerged out of the waters of death on the third day, the day of resurrection. The Lord Jesus is the dry land who came out of the death water. He was resurrected that He might regenerate us. </p>
<p data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYgwpIsf065oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa"> In the Old Testament, the land typifies Christ as the generating source. This land was buried beneath the waters of death and appeared again on the third day. As the record of the Old Testament reveals, every kind of life was produced out of this land: the plant life, the animal life, and even the human life came out of the earth. Man was made from the dust of the earth. This typifies that every kind of life comes out of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0ZLTFYqG8onn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF"> After the fall of humanity and during the time of Noah, the land was once again covered by the waters of death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26394" data-verses="Genesis 7:17-24">Gen. 7:17-24</span>), signifying that man was severed from Christ. Humanity was severed from the enjoyment of the good land. After this, the land was recovered again (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26395" data-verses="Genesis 8:13-17">Gen. 8:13-17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26396" data-verses="Genesis 8:22">22</span>). The land was recovered until the day of Babel when man fell <span class="pg" data-page-id="38" id="38">[38]</span> even further and the whole human race rose up in rebellion against God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26397" data-verses="Genesis 11:1-9">Gen. 11:1-9</span>). Thus, God called out a race with Abraham as the father to enter into the high land, the good land of Canaan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26398" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Gen. 12:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26399" data-verses="Genesis 12:5">5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26400" data-verses="Genesis 12:7">7</span>).

We have been called out of rebellion into Christ, our good land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26401" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">1 Cor. 1:9</span>). Now this good land is ours, ready to produce life. </p>

The lowest life, a life without consciousness, came into existence (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26402" data-verses="Genesis 1:11-13">Gen. 1:11-13</span>; cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26403" data-verses="Mark 4:8">Mark 4:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26404" data-verses="Hosea 14:5-7">Hosea 14:5-7</span>). This is the generating of life and happened on the third day, after the land emerged out of the death water. At that time, there was no growth of life, only the lowest form of life, a life without any consciousness. If we talk to the grass or to the trees, the grass cannot understand and the trees will not react because they have no feeling, no consciousness. They have no emotion, thought, or will because they are lives without any consciousness. This is the lowest life. </p>
<p data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnCnk81SPEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB"> When we received Christ into us, Christ appeared out of the death water within us. Christ appeared and now we have life, the generating of life. We are saved and we have life. At the time we were saved, we received life, but the life within us was very low. This is signified in the record of Genesis by the life of the grass, the life of the herbs, and the life of the fruit trees. </p>
<p data-content-id="4ih-7ivO1f_Uex_xN1d2zId9dJq1CD7MrPWGnia394uU8LdMUmJUsII4OLzctGMcQ"> Even with the plant life there are three levels: grass, the lowest plant life; the herbs which yield seeds, a higher level; and the fruit trees, an even higher level. If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26405" data-verses="Genesis 1:29-30">Genesis 1:29-30</span>, we will see that God gave the herbs and the fruit trees to man for his food.

Perhaps the life within you is similar to grass: it is life and it grows; yet it is the lowest life. Even when compared with the other plant life, grass is quite low. Although last week you might have been like the grass, today you have grown a little higher and you have become the herb <span class="pg" data-page-id="39" id="39">[39]</span> yielding the seed. I hope after two months, you will be a tree bringing forth fruit. How would you liken yourself—to the grass, the herb, or the trees? Suppose the Lord Himself would ask you, “How about you? Are you like the grass or the herb or the tree?” Today you may be an herb, but after a certain period of time perhaps you will be likened to a fruit-bearing tree. But when you become a tree, don’t become satisfied. This is not the last verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26406" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapter one</span>; it is something which happened on the third day. </p>

Although light came in on the first day, it was not that solid, not that strong. On the fourth day, not only the lights came, but also the light bearers—the sun, the moon, and the stars. These are lights which are stronger, more solid, and more available. This is the first requirement for the growth of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0ZLTFYoSMonn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF"> Suppose that you are not only the grass or the herb, but also the tree. By this time you will receive more light. Although you have the light of the first day, you need something to happen on the fourth day. You need to receive some higher lights, some fuller lights, some richer, stronger, and more available lights. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26408" data-verses="1John 1:5-7">First John 1:5-7</span> tells us that after we are saved we need more light, that we need to walk in the light. </p>

In typology, the sun typifies Christ. Christ is our sun. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26410" data-verses="Malachi 4:2">Malachi 4:2</span> tells us that Christ is the Sun of Righteousness and that there is healing in His wings. His shining forth is the wings, and with this shining forth there is healing. The second half of this verse tells us that we all will grow up under the shining of Christ. Also, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26411" data-verses="Luke 1:78-79">Luke 1:78-79</span> tells us that Christ is our dayspring, the sunrise in the early morning. Hallelujah!

Although it is difficult for us to find a verse in the Bible indicating that the moon is the church, there is, nevertheless, a basis for saying that the church is the moon. Remember Joseph’s dream about the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26414" data-verses="Genesis 37:9-11">Gen. 37:9-11</span>). The sun was his father, the moon his mother, and the stars his brothers. Based upon this fact, we may say that the church as the wife, the bride of Christ, may be typified by the moon. The church today is the moon. What is the moon? The moon is an object that has no light in itself, but has the ability to reflect light. By itself, the church has no light. But hallelujah! The church was made in a way to reflect the light of Christ. Furthermore, the moon is able to reflect light only in the night time. Today, during the church age, it is the night time. Look at the world. How dark it is! Although the church is really in a dark night (the local churches are lampstands shining in this dark night, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26415" data-verses="Revelation 1:20">Rev. 1:20</span>), she can reflect the light of Christ. However, frequently the church (like the moon) is not very stable, coming up and going down. The church may be the full moon, the half moon, or the new moon. And, when there is no moon, the stars shine. Hallelujah! </p>

<p data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_LVPeUPF0w3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj"> Before we study the creation of man, we need to consider, as a parenthesis, the matter of the fourth-day lights. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26435" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, it is recorded that on the first day of restoration God summoned the light. The first day was a day of light and that light may be called the first-day light. On the fourth day, God did something further regarding light. He made the light bearers—the sun, the moon, and the stars. The Bible does not tell us what kind of light was present on the first day, and there is no need for us to guess. The light of the first day was not very solid, strong, or definite. It was not given a specific designation; it was simply called “light.” However, the lights of the fourth day—the sun, the moon, and the stars—were definite and solid, strong and available. </p>
<p data-content-id="NgrUOPst9ndCGqPDKS1sPGsm5C7xKLEkyN_8bfWBSPyO-5g1-dnym0-8I86wUsKBc"> If we pay attention to the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26436" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, we can see that God’s restoration with His further creation was accomplished in six days. These six days were not for God’s original creation. God’s original creation was accomplished in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26437" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis chapter 1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26438" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">verse 1</span>. After creation, there was a great change which occurred somewhere in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26439" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapter one</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26440" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">verse 2</span>, and God came in to judge the universe. After that judgment, there was a long period of time. Then, God came in to restore and to have some further creation. This restoration with its further creation was accomplished in six days which may be divided into two sections: the first three days considered as the first section; the last three days considered as the second section. Each section begins with a day of light. The light of the first <span class="pg" data-page-id="48" id="48">[48]</span> day was the first-day light; the lights of the fourth day were the fourth-day lights. On the first day, God called for the light. On the fourth day He restored the sun, the moon, and the stars. This is very meaningful. </p>
<p data-content-id="topU0NZPOs7b25ters3Gd5GJK3GthSqSpV5hz_XoXr_MU93J_kJdBBom0evJv9lGi"> These days of light mark the beginning of God’s creation of life. According to the revelation of the whole Bible, light is for life. Once again, we see that God’s creation is completely focused on life. All that God created and made was focused on life and was for life. Thus, there is the need for light. Light and life always go together. On the contrary, darkness and death always go together. Before God’s restoration, darkness covered the death waters, meaning that darkness and death were one. Death is abstract and no one can see it. Therefore, the Bible uses water to signify death. The deep water of the ocean is a picture of death. Before God’s restoration, there were only two things—darkness and death. </p>
<p data-content-id="h08U91ltZnqTUI0aV0g56ny2iKoCCw-cZTKHrVo12qTwS3OgmpjHqkUk9BKO83GId"> God is life and light, the exact opposite of death and darkness. The very God of light can never tolerate darkness, so He came to dispel it. Also, the God of life can never tolerate death, so He came in to swallow it up. When you read the Bible, don’t take a scientific view—take God’s view. If we read the Bible from God’s point of view, every line will be full of light and life because the Bible is a record of the Divine Being who is light and life. The God of light and life came in to eliminate darkness and death. </p>
<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWIxrBGs2tXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> On the first day, God commanded the light to come and light came. Then, God divided light from darkness. That division was a limitation to the darkness. The God of light seemed to say to the darkness, “Darkness, listen to Me. You have been prevailing for a time and you have filled the whole universe. Now, My light comes in to limit you. You can only prevail during the night. There is no room for you in the day. I limit you. I divide light from you. Never again can you occupy the whole universe. For at least half the time the universe must belong to Me.” Hallelujah! </p>
<p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KaZz1nRfTe1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> This was good; however, it was only half good. A certain amount of darkness remains. God is still working to eliminate this dark part until we arrive at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26441" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span> where <span class="pg" data-page-id="49" id="49">[49]</span> there is the declaration, “night shall not be there” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26442" data-verses="Revelation 21:25">21:25b</span>). Hallelujah! One day there will be no more night. </p>
<p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_SQA1DalgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> God limited the darkness on the first day and, in the same principle, He limited the death waters on the third day. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26443" data-verses="Jeremiah 5:22">Jeremiah 5:22</span> we read that God limited the death waters with sand, the smallest particles of rocks. God told the death waters, “This is your limitation. You cannot go beyond it.” Thus, the dry land appeared, making a separation between the land and the sea. After the first day of God’s restoring creation, it was half light and half darkness; after the third day, it was half land and half water. God is still working to eliminate the second half of the night and the second half of the death waters. In the new heavens and the new earth, there will be no more sea (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26444" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Rev. 21:1</span>); in the New Jerusalem, there will be no more night (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26445" data-verses="Revelation 21:25">Rev. 21:25b</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26446" data-verses="Revelation 22:5">22:5</span>). This means that both darkness and death will be completely eliminated. </p>
<p data-content-id="prNfLWZ9JdrW7yTc3YS3U_PL_qhGoK-lAf5XbjI5e4-Pr6RDr_aquY_gO4K9YJN2U"> Check with yourself. How much darkness do you have? How much death do you have? You need to answer to the Lord. If in your Christian life, you are constantly growing in the Lord’s presence, one day you will be able to tell Satan, “Satan, I have no night. My day is twenty-four hours long. There is no death water with me. In my whole Christian life, everywhere, in every corner and on every avenue, there is dry land. There is no more sea.” We all must be like this. </p>
<p data-content-id="vGPkFtfe7Aen3iGIVhF4Dc2zr4FFJoSKHjShQRi-Q6TFheMiOa11sXw6WrcmFYS61"> To be like this we need the fourth-day lights. The first-day light only eliminates half of our darkness and half of our death. The fourth-day lights will bring us to another world where there is no night and no sea. </p>
<p data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3OhkPT2ZITDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12"> All the truths in the Bible were sown as seeds in the book of Genesis, especially in the first chapter. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26447" data-verses="Genesis 1:14-18">Genesis 1:14-18</span> is a wonderful seed of the light revealed throughout the Bible. According to the principle of life, the fourth-day lights are not for generating life; they are for the growth of life. On the third day, perhaps at the last part of that day, after the Lord called out the dry land and the land emerged out of the death waters, life was generated. By that time there were light, air, and land—three elements necessary for generating life. After the dry land appeared, plant life was generated. Although God was not happy at the end of the second day—He did not <span class="pg" data-page-id="50" id="50">[50]</span> say that it was good—He was surely happy at the end of the third day when He saw the light, the air, the dry land, and all the plant life. God saw the grass, the herbs, and the trees, and said that it was good. Before that time, there had been no created life on the earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQIlv6fWVG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> Starting with the plant life, life was generated. But that was the lowest life, the life with the lowest consciousness, unable to walk, unable to talk, and unable to understand God. God may speak to a lily a thousand times, but the lily cannot respond to Him because the life of a lily is too low. Although life was present, it needed to grow. The fourth-day lights were needed for the growth of life. The first-day light was for generating life; the fourth-day lights were for the growth of life. On the fourth day the solid lights were prepared; no other work was done. </p>
<p data-content-id="uMdoZ7sIrphDxIxrKnqKnfeZCN9aZxYYQWIgd4x9rSnaU9KtTeicgVo8QagD4QHNt"> Many of you young people have received the first-day light, but I doubt very much whether you have entered into the fourth-day lights. The fourth-day lights are different from the first-day light. The first-day light was indefinite; the fourth-day lights are definite. Now we need to see what the sun, moon, and stars prefigure in typology. </p>

We should never forget the nine items of life mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26579" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis chapter one</span>: the grass, the herbs, the trees, the fish, the birds, the cattle, the beasts, the creeping things, and man. Man is the highest created life. According to the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26580" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, when God reached the point of creating man, He held a conference. This conference among the Godhead was very impressive. God said, “Let us....” This is quite meaningful. The three Persons of the Godhead were needed for the creation of man. The subsequent books of the whole Bible develop the subject of the work of the Triune God upon man. God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” Then God said, “Let them.” God did not say <em>men,</em> He said <em>man</em>. Man is a singular noun, but them is a plural pronoun. “Let us make man...let them....” Was there one God or many? Was there one man or many? Our God is One, but triune. Man is one, but corporate. Hallelujah! Never forget the two “lets” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26581" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span>. God said, “Let us” and God said, “let them.” The word “us” reveals that the one God is triune; the word “them” reveals that the one man is corporate. The Triune God created a corporate man. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="CAIiqFyjjgw0LbNxWLi5D94D-xSGcXq_WajUO0fMiI1qsIetqtq6bkTvknnO7bFYb">2) To Have Man to Exercise God’s Dominion</h2><p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KaZz9nTL7e1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> God said, “Let us make man in our image...and let them <span class="pg" data-page-id="78" id="78">[78]</span> have dominion....” God created a corporate man to exercise His dominion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26582" data-verses="Genesis 1:26-28">Gen. 1:26-28</span>). The word dominion includes more than just authority. Dominion means having authority to rule and to form a kingdom. Dominion means having a kingdom as a sphere in which to exercise authority. If I have authority, but no sphere over which to rule, I have no dominion. God said, “Let man have dominion.” Man was given dominion over all things. Keep the words image and dominion in mind and underline them in your Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_SQI1BeJgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> Very few Christians pay attention to the word dominion when they read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26583" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>. We need to consider the words image and dominion a little more. An image is an expression. God created man in His image with the intention that man might express Him. The invisible God desires to be expressed. He needs an expression. Dominion means kingdom, authority. Man was made in God’s image to express God and was given authority to represent God and to have dominion. We are God’s expression and we are God’s representative. The young people especially need to lay hold of these two words with these two basic revelations: image and dominion. The purpose of God’s restoration and further creation was twofold: to have a corporate man to express God and to have a corporate man to exercise His dominion. </p>

So, here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26590" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> it especially says that man may have the dominion “over all the earth.” The earth has been usurped by Satan.

<p data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIIS_aGwD_D0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs"> Remember that the sphere of God’s dominion which He committed to man includes three sections: the seas, the dwelling place of the demons; the air, the place where Satan and his angels are; the earth, the field of Satan’s activities. </p>

That was why the Lord Jesus rebuked the wind and the waves during a storm. The wind came from the fallen angels in the air and the waves came from the demons in the water. The Lord told the wind, “Stop” and the waves, “Be calm.” Immediately the wind ceased and the waves were calm. The fallen angels and the demons were subdued and overruled by the Lord Jesus. If we know how to read the Bible, we will see in the four Gospels that the Lord Jesus exercised God’s authority over the seas, the air, and the earth. This is the sphere of God’s dominion which He committed to man. </p>

In the Bible, the creeping things are demonic, devilish, and Satanic. In the last message, we pointed out that only four living creatures, representing all creation, are present before the throne of God—the eagle, the ox, the lion, and the man. No creeping things such as serpents or scorpions are represented before God. In the Bible, Satan is typified by the serpent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26592" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Gen. 3:1</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26593" data-verses="Revelation 12:9">Revelation 12:9</span> Satan is called <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> the “ancient serpent.” He has become old since the time he first appeared in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26594" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="BLE5KA_UJUWmNHemF8RznMiyersZ0O1klPDPPz_cM4ETPjCdTs_KDy-6YMjsxBV2U"> In God’s original creation, He had only one purpose—to express Himself. Due to Satan’s rebellion, God now has another purpose—to deal with His enemy. When God created man, He had both of these purposes. Therefore, He created man in His own image that man might express Him and He gave him dominion that man might deal with His enemy. Both of these things must be accomplished. We need the image of God in order to express God and we need the dominion of God in order to subdue the enemy. </p>
<p data-content-id="x52sBK0RPP8CO8qDhR2srrPKtnAW0DNKTmsXdJCAVgGjfw6s5s9H5KtPnduIvZkRU"> We need to express God and to deal with Satan in our home life. Many times the husband comes home and immediately the wife does not express God. She expresses the serpent. The wife’s face has the appearance of a subtle serpent. Many times the husband also expresses the serpent. I have learned this by experience. Sometimes, when I saw Satan expressed in the members of my family, I didn’t say a word. I went to my bedroom, knelt down, and prayed, “Lord, bind the serpent.” A number of times I realized that I myself was expressing the serpent. Again I ran away to pray, “O Lord, forgive me. Bind the serpent.” On many occasions, the divine authority of God is not exercised. The evil power of Satan is expressed instead. Recently, I learned that many young brothers are living in the brothers’ houses. However, I am fearful that even in the brothers’ house there is still the possibility that Satan’s image, not God’s, will be expressed, that the evil power, not God’s authority, will be exercised. We all must realize that today God has this double goal to accomplish—to express Himself and to deal with His enemy. It is not really your husband who loses his temper. It is the serpent. It is not really your wife who says something to provoke your temper. It is the serpent. Don’t deal with the husband and don’t deal with the wife. It is not their fault. We must deal with the serpent that is behind them. Exchanging words can never deal with Satan. The more we argue, the more Satan gains ground. The only way to deal with Satan is to go on our knees, pray, call on the name of Jesus, and ask Him to bind the serpent. <span class="pg" data-page-id="81" id="81">[81]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXQ0j5fp4i443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> In this message we come to the ultimate consummation, the climax of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26638" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>. We need to recall the various steps in the process of God’s restoration and further creation. The Spirit was brooding over the darkness and death. Light came, and there was a division between light and darkness. God made the expanse to divide the things above from the things beneath. Next God called the dry land out of the death waters. Out of the dry land the plant life was generated. After the plant life, the fourth-day lights came in to shine upon the earth. Then came the fish life, the bird life, the cattle life, the beast life, and all the creeping things. Eventually, God created man. Man is the climax of God’s creation because man bears God’s image. This is not a small thing. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkw_ByePHOoPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU">1) God Was Expressed and Represented</h2><p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6P6xaZmr9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> Man is the expression of God because he bears God’s image. He also has the dominion of God. Man was committed with God’s dominion over the seas, the air, the earth, and especially over all the creeping things. Man has power, authority, and dominion because man looks like God. Man bears the image of God; so, man has authority. The climax in God’s creation is man bearing God’s image and representing God with His authority over all things. <span class="pg" data-page-id="90" id="90">[90]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="h08U91ltZnqTUI0aV0g56nyCiI8qCw-cZTKHrVo12qTwS3OgmpjHqkUk9BKO83GId"> When man looks at God and God looks at man, they look alike. If I take a photograph of you, you will look like the photograph and the photograph will look like you. Likewise, God can say, “Man, you are very much like Me.” Man will reply, “God, You are so much like me. We two are very much alike.” Also, when man comes out of the presence of God, he is the ruler over all created things. He has authority to rule. This is dominion, the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWIxfBEoatXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> The two crucial words in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26639" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapter one</span> of Genesis are image and dominion. You may forget the creeping things and the fish, but don’t forget man with image and dominion. Man was not made in the image of a serpent or scorpion but in the image of God. This is the climax: man bearing God’s image, exercising God’s authority to maintain dominion. </p>
<p data-content-id="MtCll2XOY8R8dFgTUXdR4ads7Xob8JwNRjNJM9TIVoQfsRCA1WYTsZI35lh9oQ1PX"> Image and dominion were sown as two seeds in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26640" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>. However, these seeds need the whole Bible to grow and develop. The harvest, the full maturity, is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26641" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span>. The whole New Jerusalem expresses God, bearing God’s appearance. The New Jerusalem also exercises God’s divine authority to maintain God’s dominion for eternity. Today, these two seeds are growing in you and me. The image of God and the authority of God are constantly growing within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="Vyv6cezndY8yrw_ApV0zPeEK7F7SJbjcYWxSSt0SaXZR8SPfWLyu4As---ucS3eoN"> Consider the case of a young married couple. The husband loves the wife, and the wife loves the husband. Although she loves her husband, the wife says within herself, “Although I love you, you are just a naughty young man.” It is doctrinally correct to tell the wife that her husband is her head. However, the wife will say within herself, “I know that my husband is my head, but actually he is a naughty young man. It is hard for me to respect him.” One day the husband is saved, and the divine life enters into him. This is the seed, and the seed grows in this young man day after day, month after month. Perhaps after eighteen months, the wife will look at her husband and say, “Surely I must respect him. Once he was just a naughty young man. But look at him today! He has some weight. He is not so loose, so light. He is weighty.” There is no need for the husband to exercise authority and say, “You must know that I am now a Christian <span class="pg" data-page-id="91" id="91">[91]</span> husband. You must submit to me.” The husband need not say this. Whenever the wife looks at him, she will realize that his words are weighty, that there is something precious and valuable about him. Spontaneously she respects him. Formerly she argued. Now she respects and honors him, considering seriously everything he says because he now bears the image of God, and out of this image comes the divine authority. This is dominion. </p>
<p data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8AfonztgcnquNKoc1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq"> Many people have read Watchman Nee’s book, <em>Spiritual Authority.</em> They simply utilize that book, saying, “We are the elders of the church. We are the leaders of a group of Christians. We are God’s authority.” If you say this, you are through with God’s authority. You do not bear the image of God. When the Lord Jesus came, He never held any attitude toward people that He was the authority and that people had to submit to Him. He never did this. However, when He was on this earth, He bore the image of God. He also had the authority of God. Authority always comes from the image. </p>
<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6vWv5kN1WapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> The ultimate consummation is that God is expressed and represented. Nothing can be higher than this. When God is expressed and represented, that is the climax. </p>
<p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWjy9C4trQfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> Man was made in God’s image that man might express Him. This is a matter of life. Life with the image is for the expression of God. God gave man dominion over all things that man might represent Him. This is a matter of authority. If you are going to represent God with authority, you need to express God in life. The whole story of the Bible is just one story, telling of the saints who expressed God and represented God. We need now to consider eighteen cases covering the Old and the New Testaments. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXkUvZgNWAwrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip">a) The Case of Abraham</h2><p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LmYUOaAXCrZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> We begin with Abraham. This does not mean that before Abraham there was no man who expressed God. There were at least three great men—Abel, Enoch, and Noah. However, if we read their history, we find no record that they conquered the enemy or subdued anything. Until Abraham, there is no record of anyone who subdued the enemy. Abraham built an altar that he might contact God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26642" data-verses="Genesis 12:7">Gen. 12:7</span>). The more you <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> contact God, the more you will bear God’s image. The more you look at God, the more you will look like God. To build an altar for the purpose of contacting God means to become more and more transformed into the image of God. Abraham didn’t build a tower. The people at Babel didn’t build an altar to contact God; they built a tower to make themselves a name (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26643" data-verses="Genesis 11:4">Gen. 11:4</span>). That is self-pride. Abraham, however, was called out of that environment; he built a small altar and there he contacted God. The more he contacted God, the more he looked like God. The Bible tells us that eventually God became a friend to Abraham and that Abraham was called the friend of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26644" data-verses="James 2:23">James 2:23</span>). If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26645" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span>, you will see that God did not come to Abraham as the Creator or the Almighty God. God came to him as a friend. God and Abraham had fellowship just like two friends talking together. By that time Abraham had become more and more like God. Therefore, we are told that Abraham conquered and defeated the enemies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26646" data-verses="Genesis 14:17">Gen. 14:17</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtqIGEiLrP_u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m">b) The Case of Joseph</h2><p data-content-id="6CXs4WE0BL6-B1B4FDiAFrJsueHfzGKjTYJeRnGmeXBe72gXmUfpgBoC9qhDjO81n"> Joseph was the last person whose history was recorded in Genesis. He lived a holy and victorious life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26647" data-verses="Genesis 39:11-12">Gen. 39:11-12</span>). He lived a life that was very much like God. God was holy; Joseph was holy. God was victorious; Joseph was victorious. Joseph bore the image of God. He was a man who fulfilled God’s intention. The story of Joseph is the story of a holy and victorious life, a life that eventually became the ruling authority. Joseph ruled over all of Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26648" data-verses="Genesis 41:39-45">Gen. 41:39-45</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26649" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis chapter one</span> we see a man made by God in His image and committed with God’s dominion. In the last few chapters of Genesis, we also see a man who really expressed God, represented God, and ruled over the whole earth. </p>

As we have seen in the previous message, the first item of this consummation was God expressed and represented. That was the climax. Based upon this point, we will consider several other points. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="0JV8hDILxxkbeRl9MfljI49fqwfFVL0iYCHdxKUekJ14F8oFrW_U5yl_qzhcrk_AB">2) God Blessed Man to Be Fruitful</h2><p data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYQqsIVm4lMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx"> God blessed man to be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and conquer it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26693" data-verses="Genesis 1:28">Gen. 1:28</span>). This is not a small thing. Before the time that God had a man to express Him and represent Him, there was no way for God to pour out His full blessing. God is rich and God is rich in blessing, but before the creation of man there was no object to receive His blessing in full. There was no way and no opportunity for God to render His blessing to His creatures in a full way. According to the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26694" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, God did not begin to bless until the time when the living creatures came into being (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26695" data-verses="Genesis 1:22">Gen. 1:22</span>). Yet, only the human life is up to the standard to receive God’s blessing in full. After God created man, He was able to see on earth a living creature bearing His image and having His dominion. Immediately God bestowed His full blessing upon man. </p>
<p data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZgwDrXBsp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6"> Blessing is a good word. Many talk about God’s blessing. We have prayed many times, “O Lord, bless us.” However, if we are to receive God’s blessing, we need to meet the <span class="pg" data-page-id="106" id="106">[106]</span> qualifications. The qualifications, once again, are image and dominion. If there is the image of God with God’s dominion in your home, you can be assured that the blessing of God will be there. God’s blessing always follows His image and His dominion. In other words, God’s blessing always follows His expression and His representation. </p>
<p data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIIS_iGwDfD0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs"> God’s blessing is always with the priesthood and the kingship. We see this with Melchizedek. He was the king of Salem and the priest of the Most High God who blessed Abraham (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26696" data-verses="Genesis 14:17-19">Gen. 14:17-19</span>). Blessing always comes with the priesthood and the kingship. If the church is seeking God’s blessing, the church must have the priesthood and the kingship. What do the priesthood and the kingship mean? They simply mean God’s image and God’s dominion. The priesthood is for God’s image; the kingship is for God’s dominion. As long as we exercise the priesthood to contact God, to behold God and to reflect the image of glory, we have the kingship. God’s blessing follows immediately. </p>
<p data-content-id="yObOo7LOjjFarxWXeCIo4MQM-W6LfP03Kiwq9oNdUXzgDgrb2yrYAyxlelIIkT9lp"> God blessed man that he might be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth. The blessing is fruit bearing, increase, multiplication, and the filling of the earth. Suppose Adam, the corporate man, had been made in the image of a scorpion or serpent, and God blessed the scorpion and the serpent to multiply and fill the earth. The earth would have been filled with scorpions and serpents. What a dreadful earth that would have been! If this had been the case, I would prefer to have never been born. Suppose you had two hundred scorpions in your bedroom and two hundred serpents in your living room. That would not be a blessing, but a curse. God, however, created a man in His image, giving him authority to have dominion for the Almighty on earth. This man was ready for God’s blessing. God’s blessing was to enable this man to be fruitful. One would become ten, ten would become one hundred, one hundred would become a thousand, a thousand would become a hundred thousand, a hundred thousand would become a million, and a million would become a billion, until the whole earth was filled with beautiful faces expressing God and representing God. </p>
<p data-content-id="8UouUokiSDmfQ5btvmO_u9ChcwG0LW5y_xM7y0Cjh31lO6uhzd5IR1LXaUCBwG1Zr"> Although human beings are fallen, something wonderful <span class="pg" data-page-id="107" id="107">[107]</span> still remains. That wonderful thing is the image of God. People may love dogs, but the love for a dog is much different than the love for a human being. Regardless of how good a dog is, it is not nearly as lovable as a human being. Every human being is lovable because every human being bears the image of God. Regardless of how much human beings have fallen, the earth is filled with men bearing the image of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="0JV8hDILxxkbeRl9MfljI49fqx7hVL0iYCHdxKUekJ14F8oFrW_U5yl_qzhcrk_AB"> In the church life today we are the real man bearing God’s image and exercising God’s dominion. In the church life we are ready for God to come in and render His blessing to us. How much God is able to bless us depends on how much we express Him and represent Him. If we express Him and represent Him in an adequate way, we will surely have His full blessing in multiplication and fruit bearing. </p>
<p data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYQqsIVksdMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx"> At this point I would like to say a word about gospel preaching. Everything in the Christian field, including gospel preaching, has been damaged by the poor practice of the past centuries. The real gospel preaching is not only an outward work. Real gospel preaching is fruit bearing out of the overflow of the inner life. In Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the Lord Jesus said to go, preach the gospel, and disciple the nations, but in John He said that we must bear fruit. Preaching is one thing; fruit bearing is another thing. Genuine gospel preaching is not to convince people doctrinally, to subdue their thinking, and change their concept. Genuine gospel preaching is to minister life to others. Fruit bearing is the outflow of the riches of the inner life. Look at the branch of a tree filled with the life juice. The branch has the overflow of life and this overflow produces fruit. Fruit is the issue of the inner riches of life. We must realize that gospel preaching should be fruit bearing and that fruit bearing comes from God’s blessing. Although we need to pray for the gospel preaching, it is not simply a matter of our endeavoring. We must have God’s blessing. If a church wants to increase, the gospel certainly must be preached. However, if the preaching of the gospel is not under God’s blessing, nothing will be gained regardless of how much we endeavor. The fruit gained will not have human faces, but scorpion faces. You may bring in many people, but when God looks at them He will say, “This is a scorpion, that <span class="pg" data-page-id="108" id="108">[108]</span> is a serpent, and that is a frog. Yes, you brought in many people, but not many with a proper face expressing God.” What kind of person are you going to bring in? People with the faces of scorpions or people with beautiful faces expressing God Himself? The fruit you bear is an expression of what you are. If you are an apple tree, you can never bear oranges. If you are a peach tree, you can never bear bananas. If you are going to produce bananas, you must be a banana tree. If you are a tree of knowledge, don’t expect to bear the fruit of life. Only the tree of life can produce the fruit of life. We all must endeavor to preach the gospel, but consider what we are. If we are in the image of God and if we have the dominion of God, we will surely bring others into the image of God and dominion of God. All the local churches need the increase, but never use gimmicks, which may produce “Moabites” instead of the proper fruit. </p>
<p data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZgwDrVFQp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6"> God promised Abraham a seed. God was testing Abraham until Abraham’s natural energy was terminated. Then He would give him a seed. While Abraham was under God’s testing, his wife came in with a good proposal (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26697" data-verses="Genesis 16:1-2">Gen. 16:1-2</span>). It worked. But it did not bring forth Isaac whom God wanted, but Ishmael whom God rejected. In English letters, both Isaac and Ishmael start with “Is.” They are very much alike. All the churches need the increase, but don’t imitate Sarah. Don’t produce Ishmaelites. </p>
<p data-content-id="BLE5KA_UJUWmNHemF8RznMiKercR0O1klPDPPz_cM4ETPjCdTs_KDy-6YMjsxBV2U"> Another case was the two daughters of Lot (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26698" data-verses="Genesis 19:30-38">Gen. 19:30-38</span>). Do you remember how they discussed fruit bearing? They said, “There is a possibility that our father will have no descendants. Let us do something to help him produce an heir.” They did something, and it worked. They brought forth Moabites and Ammonites. Many Christians today bring forth Ishmaelites, Moabites, or Ammonites. It is better not to have any descendants like these. </p>
<p data-content-id="x52sBK0RPP8CO8qDhR2srrPytnwe0DNKTmsXdJCAVgGjfw6s5s9H5KtPnduIvZkRU"> We must be men who bear God’s image and exercise God’s authority. Then we will be under God’s blessing to be fruitful and multiply. Human faces with God’s image will fill the earth. This is one of the points of the ultimate consummation. Don’t think that gospel preaching is something low. It must <span class="pg" data-page-id="109" id="109">[109]</span> be high. Our gospel preaching must be the climax, not producing Ishmaelites, Moabites, or Ammonites, but Isaacs. </p>

This was revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26728" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1—2:3</span>. God’s desire and purpose are to have a corporate man to express Him in His image and to represent Him with His authority. Now we must ask a question: how can man express God in His image and represent Him with His authority? This brings us to the second main point of this book. </p>

This is why we have the second record of creation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26730" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>. When I was a young Christian, I was troubled by these two records of the creation of man. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26731" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> provided us a record of creation. Why do we need another record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26732" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>? It was not until the later days of my ministry that God showed me the answer. Although the record of creation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26733" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> reveals God’s purpose in creating man, it does not show us the way to fulfill this purpose. Therefore, we need the second record to reveal the way, the procedure, God takes to fulfill His purpose. After seeing the purpose in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26734" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapter 1</span>, we must come to see the procedure in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26735" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">chapter 2</span>. This procedure is fully revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26736" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, starting with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26737" data-verses="Genesis 2:5">verse 5</span> and continuing through the end of the chapter. If we read this portion of the Word in the light of the whole Bible, we will see that this procedure is of three steps. We can only <span class="pg" data-page-id="118" id="118">[118]</span> cover one step in this message, leaving the remaining two steps for subsequent messages. However, before we consider the first step, we want to point out that the means by which God fulfills His purpose is life. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="4ih-7ivO1f_Uex_xN1d2zINtdL-VCD7MrPWGnia394uU8LdMUmJUsII4OLzctGMcQ">1. By Life</h2><p data-content-id="oojwSJGvLbmiYj5tIQGoqZgUH7L44PdhX0jmIOM9tm0WtyG5HMI5sjMdIyAZ1hq_3"> God is going to accomplish His purpose by means of His own life. How can one person express another if he does not have that person’s life? A dog cannot express a cat because a dog does not have a cat’s life. A dog has a dog’s life, and this life is only suitable for expressing a dog. According to the same principle, a cat can never express a dog. If we think otherwise, we are dreaming. How can we human beings express God? There is no way except by having the life of God. If a dog is to express a cat, there must be a way to inject the cat’s life into the dog. Once a dog has received a cat’s life, it will be easy for it spontaneously to become the expression of a cat. Man is destined to express God. Are we able to do this? It is impossible for us to do it by our life because it is simply a human life. God is transcendent. Our life is too low to express Him. If we are going to express God, we need the life of God. If we have the life of God, we will express Him spontaneously and unconsciously. Once we have His life, we will express His image. Life is the way to fulfill God’s purpose. This life is not our natural life, but the divine and eternal life of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LmYEuaAXirZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> Authority is also related to life. Neither a table nor a chair has authority, for authority is always related to a certain life. Look at yourself. The more life you have, the more authority you have. Human beings have authority over the animals because we have more life than the animals. Even in the area of human relationships we find it true that the more life a person has the more authority he has. If I am more mature than you, I have authority over you. If a teenager comes to me, there is no need for me to threaten him. He spontaneously will come under my authority. This authority was not given to me by the President of the United States. It came from my age. If you are 110 years of age and I am 70, I will come under your authority. Your age assigns you the <span class="pg" data-page-id="119" id="119">[119]</span> authority. In order to represent God with His authority, we need His life. </p>
<p data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtqIWkiLrv_u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m"> If you are to represent a certain person in society, you need to possess a life that is nearly the same as his. Suppose you are invited to represent the President of the United States. You need to have the same amount of life as he. If your life is rather low, you will be unable to represent him. The standard of your life must match the life of the President. </p>
<p data-content-id="6CXs4WE0BL6-B1B4FDiAFrZMue3XzGKjTYJeRnGmeXBe72gXmUfpgBoC9qhDjO81n"> This is the basic and logical principle that we must care for: we can never express God or represent God by our own life. Consider your life. Your life is incapable of expressing God; it is only adequate to express yourself. To a certain extent, a woman is not even qualified in life to represent her husband, because her life is not as high as her husband’s. I wonder if the sisters agree with this. At any rate, we all must admit that our natural life disqualifies us from expressing God and representing Him. Not only is our fallen life inadequate for this, but even the created life we had at the beginning was inadequate. As we shall see in the next message, this was the reason God, after creating man, placed him in front of the tree of life, indicating that man needed to possess a higher life than he already had. </p>
<p data-content-id="R_GfdTPWaEiXNNW82-yDaXV7DhuiLG6UWYb4K416h7Rart6vExDqqOyU38XwPBejO"> Some people may ask, “Didn’t God create us in His image?” Yes, God did create us in His image. Then these people may say, “Since we already have God’s image, why can’t we express Him?” We may say that the man created in the image of God resembles the photograph of a person. Suppose you take a photograph of Brother John and show it to others saying that this is Brother John. In a sense, you are correct, for that is Brother John. However, the photograph is not the real Brother John; it is Brother John in a picture. Although the picture reveals the features, style, and the person of Brother John, it does not have the life of Brother John. It can show something of Brother John, but it cannot express him. The only way for the photograph to express Brother John is for it to have his life. Man was created in the image of God, but he was like a photograph showing something of God without having the life of God. Although man was in the image of God, he did not have the life of God. God <span class="pg" data-page-id="120" id="120">[120]</span> intended that man should partake of the life indicated by the tree of life. Man failed to do it. Today, by believing in Christ, we have been brought back to share in that life. We all have received eternal life. Thus, there is no other way for us to express God in His image and to represent God with His authority except by sharing His life. This is confirmed by many verses in the Bible. </p>

It is by this life of the Spirit that we can be conformed to the Son of God. This is very clear. Also, it is Christ as life who brings us into God’s glory to express God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26743" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">Colossians 3:4</span> tells us that Christ our life will bring us into God’s glory that we may express God. This confirms the claim that it is by God’s life that we express God. </p>

<p data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2yyKOZ0hY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df"> In the past ten messages we have seen clearly from the holy Word that God’s eternal purpose is to express Himself through man and to commit His authority to man that man may exercise His dominion on the earth. We have also seen that God’s way to fulfill His purpose is by life. As the first step in the accomplishment of His purpose, God created mankind in a very specific way, forming them as vessels to contain Himself, not as instruments to work for Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26791" data-verses="Romans 9:1">Romans 9</span> declares definitely that God made man out of clay as vessels of mercy unto honor and glory to contain God Himself. Thus, God created man with a special organ—the human spirit. We should never forget <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26792" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">Zechariah 12:1</span> which says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. In this universe three things are necessary for the fulfillment of God’s purpose: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man. Our spirit is extremely important; it is just as vital for the accomplishment of God’s purpose as are the heavens and the earth. Although the spirit of man is not spacious as the heavens or large as the earth, it is nevertheless the most crucial aspect of our being. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ss-Kv9Ptsxb3Hpm3OLvQWTQW3Xg5kwLJkPM-9Yo5gpNrugTwkZhE_qWQlLbkcq0fN"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26793" data-verses="Job 32:8">Job 32:8</span> says, “There is a spirit in man.” Everyone knows that man has a heart, mind, will, and conscience, but few people realize that man has a spirit. By this we do not mean the Holy Spirit of God; we refer to the human spirit of man. We have such an organ created by God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="134" id="134">[134]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="gUDsBBjBPjRtaf2PAgd0RImSJm6RKXdsQrQ3vEcVWKTvzkKR8PehPPTdnoCg5OrXo"> Consider the organs of our physical body: we have hearing organs, seeing organs, smelling, tasting, and touching organs. With my eyes I can see many different colors. If I were blind, I would be unable to substantiate the existence of these colors. Although colors would continue to exist, I would have no way to substantiate them, for a certain object can only be substantiated by the organ specifically designed for that purpose. As I am speaking, your ears substantiate the sound of my voice. If you had no ears, it would seem as if my voice did not exist. The same is true for our sense of smell. Although there may be a fragrant aroma in this room, we need the sense of smell to substantiate it. </p>
<p data-content-id="e4Tu7RSEEn956Bu43KIdFs9VelQZLhbqE99G8qhMhliWdoAMPEcx2IgxrawDytCgr"> God has not only created our physical organs, but also our psychological organs. How can we verify the existence of thought? We substantiate thought by the function of our mind. Likewise, by the emotional organ of joy in our soul, we can sense happiness. We substantiate the existence of thought and joy by the appropriate psychological organs in our soul. </p>
<p data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_LVfOUMF0w3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj"> In addition to our physical and psychological organs, God has created a spiritual organ—the human spirit. Although it is difficult to understand our spirit, we can know something about it through the function of our conscience. Although few people understand the human spirit, everybody knows the meaning of conscience. According to the Bible, the conscience is the main organ of our human spirit. Where is our conscience located? It is not easy to determine. In fact, it is also difficult to locate our emotion, mind, and heart. Actually, we have two hearts, a physical heart and a psychological heart. It is easy to locate our physical heart, but difficult to find our psychological heart. We cannot deny that we have such a heart, but we are unable to locate it. The same is true for our conscience. Although we are unable to locate it, we know it exists because it constantly accuses or excuses us. Our conscience continually protests against our reasoning and our emotions. For example, some young people in school are tempted to steal when they think of others as being rich and having everything and of themselves as poor. Thus, they decide to steal from others, making some flimsy excuse to <span class="pg" data-page-id="135" id="135">[135]</span> justify their action. The mind agrees, the emotions approve, and the will decides. However, as the young person is about to steal something, his conscience protests, “Don’t do this; it is not right.” Even if he should ignore the feeling of his conscience and steal something, the voice of his conscience will condemn him for many days. This inner voice is not from the mind, emotion, or heart; it is from the conscience, and the conscience is the main part of our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2MxaInS9iDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> Now we must relate this to a very important matter about God. What is God? God is a spiritual substance. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26794" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span> Jesus says that God is Spirit. This table next to me is made of wood; wood is its substance. Likewise, God is Spirit; the substance of the divine being of God is Spirit. The organ by which we can substantiate such a divine being is our human spirit. If we try to experience God without exercising our spirit, it will be like attempting to substantiate colors without exercising our sight. If we use the wrong organ, it is impossible to substantiate God. We praise God that in His creation He formed a spirit within us. Since we were made as vessels to contain God, we do need our spirit as the proper receiver. </p>
<p data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQcyZHrozFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B"> The receiver in our physical body is our stomach. If we had a mouth without a stomach, it would be impossible to receive food for the supply of the whole body. The stomach is not only a receiver but also a digestive organ which assimilates food and dispenses it into the blood cells. Eventually, the substance of the digested and assimilated food becomes our very organic tissues. God has the intention of dispensing Himself into us. How can He do this? He does it by being food to us. The Lord Jesus Himself told us that He came as the bread of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26795" data-verses="John 6:35">John 6:35</span>). He also said, “He who eats Me shall also live because of Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26796" data-verses="John 6:57">John 6:57</span>). This means that Jesus is not only our Savior, Redeemer, and life, but also our life supply. He is the bread of life. God desires to dispense Himself into us by being food for us to receive. What organ do we use to take God into us? Our human spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="QMSNPOcCBLw6v-EOydvwYFFxIvozduX4YH5_O01lRUzkJdbjHu_x8PZ2HwO74uIjb"> We need to pray. Praying is not simply asking God to do things for us. This understanding of prayer is too shallow. Prayer is breathing. Whenever we pray, “O Father in heaven,” or call, “O Lord Jesus,” that is breathing. As we breathe, we <span class="pg" data-page-id="136" id="136">[136]</span> take breath into us. Likewise, whenever we pray to God by exercising our spirit, we receive His divine being into our spirit. Within our spirit we contain Him and, in a sense, we assimilate Him and dispense His divine elements into our whole being. In this way God comes into us as life. As human beings, we were made by God in a very specific manner: we were made as vessels with a receiver, our human spirit. This was the first step God took to accomplish His purpose. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7Wm7Sel3Z3ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo">3. The Second Step—<br/>to Have Man to Receive God as Life—2:8-17</h2><p data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKQhyQn3gvCaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI"> Now we come to the second step. Most people cannot accomplish anything in a single step. Thus, after God created man as vessels with a human spirit to receive Him and to contain Him, He took another step by placing man in front of the tree of life. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnC3w81SfEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB">a. Placing Man in Front of the Tree of Life</h2><p data-content-id="4ih-7ivO1f_Uex_xN1d2zINpdJqlCD7MrPWGnia394uU8LdMUmJUsII4OLzctGMcQ"> As I mentioned in the last message, when I was a young Christian I was troubled by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26797" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> because it did not seem to be a classical piece of writing as I felt the Bible ought to be. It reminded me of the play of some little boys who made images out of clay and put them before certain objects. Nevertheless, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26798" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, God placed man in front of the tree of life. What is life? Life is mysterious. Not even medical doctors or biologists are able to define life. Although life is mysterious, it is presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26799" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> in a solid and substantial way as the tree of life. We may be eager to know the meaning of the tree of life, but we cannot afford to be hasty. We should not approach something as mysterious as life in a quick and superficial way. It is easy to talk about this blackboard, but very difficult to speak about life. For the time being we simply need to see that God put man in front of this tree of life. </p>

If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26881" data-verses="Exodus 28:6-21">Exodus 28:6-21</span>, we learn that onyx stones mounted in plaited settings of gold were placed upon the shoulders of the ephod and that twelve precious stones were set in gold on the breastplate worn by the high priest. Precious materials are also mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26882" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:12">1 Corinthians 3:12</span>. Paul says that we must take heed how we build the church, that we should build with gold, silver, and precious stones. Although Paul replaces pearl with silver, the other two substances remain the same. The Lord Jesus spoke of stones when He told Peter that he was a stone for the building of the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26883" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matt. 16:18</span>). Then Peter, in his first Epistle, said that we all are living stones for the building of a spiritual house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26884" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">1 Pet. 2:5</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Vyv6cezndY8yrw_ApV0zPeUi7E_2JbjcYWxSSt0SaXZR8SPfWLyu4As---ucS3eoN"> We also need to pay attention to a very crucial word in the New Testament—transformation. This word is correctly translated from the Greek language in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26885" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Romans 12:2</span>, which says that we should be transformed by the renewing of our mind. However, the same Greek word is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26886" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span> where it is rendered by the King James Version “changed.” According to the proper translation, it should read, “transformed into the same image.” Thus, the Greek word for transformation is found at least twice in the New Testament. <span class="pg" data-page-id="148" id="148">[148]</span> An English equivalent to the Greek is the term metabolic change. Transformation is not a mere outward change; it is an organic change, a metabolic change. Transformation means to change a substance from one form and element into another form and element. Precious stones are produced by such a process of transformation. This is the meaning of transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8Afonztgc3CuM-Qc1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq"> Many Christians do not know that the Bible covers the matter of transformation. Therefore, this entire message will be devoted to it. In the previous messages we have seen the eternal purpose of God, which is to express Himself and to exercise His dominion through man. For the fulfillment of this purpose, God created man in a specific way as a vessel to contain God Himself as life. Thus, God created man with a human spirit that he might contact God, receive God, retain God, and assimilate God into his whole being. After creating man in this way, God placed him in a garden with the tree of life as the center. Near the tree of life was a river flowing with living water, and at the flow of this river were gold, pearl, and onyx stones. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26887" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> presents such a vivid picture. </p>
<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6vGH5lpJWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> What does this picture signify? We know that the Bible is very economical: not one paragraph, sentence, or word is wasted. Every word is God-breathed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26888" data-verses="2Timothy 3:16">2 Tim. 3:16</span>). Therefore, we must learn why God used nearly a whole chapter to portray a garden, a tree, a man, a river, and three precious materials. What does it all mean? </p>
<p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWjytq4v_gfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> The Bible as a whole is God’s revelation, and most of the seeds of this revelation were sown in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26889" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span>. For example, God, man, and life are some seeds sown in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26890" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> and developed throughout the whole Bible. The seeds sown in Genesis grow in the following books of the Bible, especially in the New Testament, producing a crop in the Epistles and a harvest in Revelation. Nearly everything sown in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26891" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span> is reaped as a great harvest in the book of Revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXkU_xgPS0wrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip"> Based upon this principle, let us attend to some of the items found in both Genesis and Revelation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26892" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we have the tree of life in the midst of the garden. Then we have a river which flows by the side of the tree and brings forth gold, pearl, and onyx stone. The setting for all of this is a <span class="pg" data-page-id="149" id="149">[149]</span> garden, and a garden signifies the natural things created by God. In a garden we can see the growth of created things. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROmLD9TljeOlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX"> When we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26893" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span>, we do not find a garden, but a city. A city is not created; it is built. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26894" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we have creation; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26895" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span> we have the building. In the city we also have the tree of life. Thus, the Bible begins and ends with life. Moreover, in the city we find a river of living water proceeding out of the throne of God. This corresponds to the river in the garden. Furthermore, in Revelation we find the three categories of precious materials, not in a natural state, but built into a city made with gold, pearl, and precious stones. Therefore, what was sown in Genesis as a seed is reaped in Revelation as the harvest. The growth of the seed and the development of the crop are found between Genesis and Revelation. This is not our human concept; it is the revelation of the divine Word found in the first and last chapters of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9BnbFhLAG6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr"> In the beginning of the Bible we can see a garden. At the end of the Bible we see a city. Between the garden and the city a long process must transpire, and a great deal of work must be accomplished. Nevertheless, the seed sown in the garden becomes the harvest in the city. This seed includes the tree of life, a river of water, and the three precious materials. At the time of harvest in Revelation, the materials are no longer in a natural state, but become a building fitly joined together. The New Jerusalem is a building of gold, pearl, and precious stones. </p>
<p data-content-id="FyrUURSenH7AUUlr0ndgcucIHmHevlth22OadvBKOnc_QUvWSaFJlMIPAfMT2Bdu2"> If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26896" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span> carefully, we will see the entire city of New Jerusalem is a mountain of gold. It is not an edifice of clay. This golden mountain is also a golden city. Thus, the gold is the site, the ground for the building of the city. The precious stones are built into the wall of the New Jerusalem, and every gate in this wall is a large pearl. The site of the New Jerusalem is gold, the wall is composed of precious stones, and each of the twelve gates is a pearl. Therefore, this city is a composition of the precious materials found in a natural state in the garden. In Genesis the precious substances are lying in the garden; in Revelation they are built into a city. <span class="pg" data-page-id="150" id="150">[150]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="CAIiqFyjjgw0LbNxWLi5D9oX-w2icXq_WajUO0fMiI1qsIetqtq6bkTvknnO7bFYb"> This is not my interpretation. Between Genesis and Revelation we have 1 Corinthians. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26897" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span> Paul says that as a masterbuilder he laid the unique foundation, Jesus Christ, and that we all must take heed how we build upon it. What materials are we using in building up the church? Paul tells us to build with gold, silver, and precious stones. (Later we will see why he substituted silver for pearl.) By this we can see that not only the New Jerusalem is built with gold, pearl, and precious stones, but even the church in this age must be built with gold, silver, and precious stones, not with wood, grass, and straw. As we shall see, gold contrasts with wood, silver opposes grass, and precious stones are versus straw. </p>
<p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KaZjpnRfDe1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> When I saw this as a young Christian, I was excited. I saw a garden in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26898" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> with precious materials. I saw a city in Revelation built with these same materials. Between Genesis and Revelation I saw a church built with gold, silver, and precious stones. I saw that the church is a composition of all the redeemed people, and that this composition is a building. Who are the gold, silver, and stones? You and I. We, God’s redeemed people, are the materials for His spiritual building. </p>

<p data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XQ75Ddovkw1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW"> In the foregoing messages, we have covered God’s eternal purpose and some of the points regarding God’s way of fulfilling His purpose. God’s way of accomplishing His purpose was firstly to create man as a vessel to contain Himself as life and then to place him in a garden before the tree of life, indicating that God’s intention was for man to partake of the fruit of this tree. However, along with the tree of life, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26945" data-verses="Genesis 2:9">Genesis 2:9</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26946" data-verses="Genesis 2:17">17</span> mention the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Therefore, we need to consider very carefully the significance of these two trees. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="LD01-v3um3NuLShGttlViqmenXPsRg9jsTHcyuTXlEDKbBHncuqREEkOSwGaFv9xn">b. Allowing Man to Have Free Choice—2:16-17</h2><p data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD0XuV0DvfiWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP"> Although God wanted man to eat of the tree of life, He did not force him to do it. Neither did God put the tree of life into him. Instead, God gave man free will. He gave him freedom of choice. When mothers feed their infant children, they seem to force the children to take the food. Nevertheless, the baby still has free will, for often he refuses the food that has been put in his mouth. The mother wants her child to eat, but she must recognize that he has a free will. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROmLD5Tn32OlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX"> God created man with freedom of choice. Why did God do this? God is great. He is not small. Only a small man forces people to accept his opinion. If you compel others to take your way, it proves that you are a small person. If you are a great man, you will never force people to accept you. You will always give them a choice, saying, “If you love me, you may <span class="pg" data-page-id="160" id="160">[160]</span> take me. If you do not care for me, you are free to forget about me.” No man who is great or honorable will coerce people. Likewise, God is great. He is so attractive as the God of glory. God did not place man in front of Him exclusively, thus compelling man to choose Him. He placed man before two trees, confronting him with a choice. </p>
<p data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9BnbBhJEq6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr"> When I was a young Christian, I was bothered by this. I said, “Why did God put man into such a dangerous situation? If I had been God, I would have removed the tree of knowledge of good and evil. I would have left the tree of life, placed man in front of it, and built a high protective wall to keep him safe. Why didn’t God do this? Why did God put the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden as a temptation? Every problem comes from this source. Why didn’t God take it away? If He had removed this tree, it would have saved us a great deal of trouble.” I was not the only one who had these questions. Many young people asked me the same thing. However, if God had not given man a choice, He would have forced him to take the tree of life. God is too great to do such a thing. God is honorable and attractive. In order to display His greatness and prove His attractiveness, He needs the second tree. </p>
<p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQbpE9rmRUHTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> According to the book of Job, Satan, the adversary of God, accused Job to God. He seemed to say, “Why does Job worship You? He worships You only because You bless him. If You take away all these blessings, Job will forsake You and renounce You to Your face” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26947" data-verses="Job 1:9-11">Job 1:9-11</span>). In other words, Satan told the Lord that He was bribing Job to worship Him and that if He did not bribe him, Job would forsake Him. Thus, Satan was slandering God as well as Job. God seemed to answer Satan, “Do as much as you can. I only command you to spare his life. I will prove to you that Job has not been bribed, but that he has been attracted by Me. Job worships Me out of his own free will.” </p>
<p data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYgw5UseQW5oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa"> God is the same today. He never forces anyone to accept Him. When the Lord Jesus came, He did not coerce people into following Him. He presented Himself to people, but always respected their freedom of choice. The Lord seemed to say, “If you like Me, you may take Me. If you don’t like Me, you may forget about Me.” Some of us may feel that we have been <span class="pg" data-page-id="161" id="161">[161]</span> compelled by the Lord’s mercy to believe in Him. To a certain extent, I feel the same way. His mercy has conquered us, persuading us to receive Him. Nevertheless, I can testify strongly that if you force me to reject Him, I will still take Him. I will never give Him up. Why have there been so many martyrs throughout the centuries? The Lord God stayed away, allowing His people to make a choice, that the actual situation might be proved to His enemy. God seemed to say, “Do your best, Satan. My people still choose Me.” Our brother Watchman Nee was imprisoned for twenty years, from 1952 until his death in 1972, where he was tested and tempted. He never changed his choice because his Lord was too lovely and too attractive. We have received the Lord Jesus, not because we have been forced or pressed, but because we have been called by His glory and attracted by His virtue (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26948" data-verses="2Peter 1:3">2 Pet. 1:3</span>). We all can confess that regardless of what people might offer us, we would never renounce the Lord Jesus. Our Lord is too dear, too precious, and too attractive. We have made Him our unique choice. </p>
<p data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0ZLDZYoSconn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF"> The same principle operated in the garden of Eden when God placed Adam before the two trees, which denoted two sources. God wanted man to choose Him as the tree of life. </p>

<p data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2yyCOYwdY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df"> The tree of life was a symbol, signifying God as the proper source (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26949" data-verses="Psalms 36:9">Psa. 36:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26950" data-verses="John 1:4">John 1:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26951" data-verses="John 10:10">10:10b</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26952" data-verses="John 11:25">11:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26953" data-verses="John 14:6">14:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26954" data-verses="1John 5:12">1 John 5:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26955" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">Col. 3:4</span>). If we only read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26956" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, we will be unable to understand the meaning of the tree of life. However, the Gospel of John reveals the life denoted by the tree of life in a concrete way. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26957" data-verses="John 1:4">John 1:4</span> says, “In Him was life,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26958" data-verses="John 15:5">John 15:5</span> tells us that the Lord Jesus is a vine tree. If we put these two verses together, we will realize that Christ is the tree of life. Jesus, the embodiment of God, is the tree of life. Therefore, the tree of life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26959" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> is a symbol of God as the source of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ss-Kv9Ptsxb3Hpm3OLvQWTQe3WUJkwLJkPM-9Yo5gpNrugTwkZhE_qWQlLbkcq0fN"> Besides this source, there is another tree, another source in the universe—death. However, this tree is not called the <span class="pg" data-page-id="162" id="162">[162]</span> tree of death; it is called the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. There is such a tree in this universe. These two trees oppose one another, the tree of life denoting God as the source of life, and the tree of knowledge signifying Satan as the source of death. As God is the source of life, Satan is the source of death. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26960" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we find two sources signified by two trees. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUDsBBjBPjRtaf2PAgd0RImaJnelKXdsQrQ3vEcVWKTvzkKR8PehPPTdnoCg5OrXo"> Throughout the course of this life-study, we have pointed out several times that nearly everything in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26961" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span> is a seed of the divine revelation. The two trees are such seeds. Along with all the other seeds sown in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26962" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span>, these seeds grow in the following books of the Bible and are reaped as a harvest in the book of Revelation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26963" data-verses="Revelation 20:10">Revelation 20:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26964" data-verses="Revelation 20:14">14</span> we see that death is cast into the lake of fire. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26965" data-verses="Revelation 22:2">Revelation 22:2</span> we see that life abides in the New Jerusalem. At the beginning of the Bible we find death and life, and at the end of the Bible we again see death and life. Between the two ends of the Bible two lines are set forth—the line of death and the line of life. Both lines begin in the book of Genesis and end in the book of Revelation. Death begins with the tree of knowledge of good and evil and ends with the lake of fire. Life begins with the tree of life and ends at the New Jerusalem. Before we were saved, we were on the line of death. After we were saved, we were put on the line of life. </p>

The content of the tree of life is life. It is life, simply, purely, and absolutely. The nature of this tree and the result of this tree are also life. Life is the content, nature, and result. Everything is life. </p>

<p data-content-id="vGPkFtfe7Aen3iGIVhF4Dcm3r5BhJoSKHjShQRi-Q6TFheMiOa11sXw6WrcmFYS61"> In the previous message we have seen that the tree of knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan, who has the power of death, the contents of which are all things apart from God and the nature and result of which are both death. Now we have to see what is the principle of this tree. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3OhkfX2Y8rDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12">d) Its Principle—to Be Independent</h2><p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQI1r6eypG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> If we know the principle of the tree of life, we will also know the principle of the tree of knowledge, for it is opposite the principle of the tree of life. The principle of the tree of life is dependence; the principle of the tree of knowledge is independence. Anything we do in dependence upon the Lord is in the principle of the tree of life. Anything we do independently of the Lord is in the principle of the tree of knowledge. </p>
<p data-content-id="uMdoZ7sIrphDxIxrKnqKnfOdCPpqZxYYQWIgd4x9rSnaU9KtTeicgVo8QagD4QHNt"> Everyone wants to be independent. However, we should never be independent of the Lord. Spiritual independence means death. If we are independent, we kill ourselves. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnmWdwK4svQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM"> To be independent of the Lord means to have an insulation separating us from the Lord, an insulation which cuts off the flow of divine electricity. Although we may have an electrical power plant with tremendous resources and all the necessary equipment properly installed, all is useless if there is insulation at the switch. That insulation severs the flow of electricity. Only a slight amount of insulation, perhaps a paper-thin layer, will cut off the flow. Independence is a spiritual insulation, disconnecting us from the life of God. Do not <span class="pg" data-page-id="172" id="172">[172]</span> think of yourself as an expert in spiritual matters. Regardless of how long electricity has been applied, it still needs application without insulation. It is the same in the spiritual realm. Never say, “I have much experience in Christ. I have been exercising my spirit for years, and I don’t need to do it any more.” We should never adopt this attitude. We need to depend on the Lord continually. Never be independent of the living Lord. One second of independence means death. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3OhkfX2ZIDDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12">3) The Realization of the Two Principles</h2><p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQI1r6fWFG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> The principle of the tree of life and the principle of the tree of knowledge of good and evil are realized throughout the whole Bible. All the negative things in the Bible are on the line of the tree of knowledge, and all the positive things are on the line of the tree of life. I call the first line the line of knowledge and the second line, the line of life. If we follow these two lines, they carry us through the entire Scripture. </p>
<p data-content-id="uMdoZ7sIrphDxIxrKnqKnfOdCN9KZxYYQWIgd4x9rSnaU9KtTeicgVo8QagD4QHNt"> Firstly, man was induced to eat of the tree of knowledge. As a result, man fell. The descendants of fallen man did not depend upon God at all. They relied upon their knowledge. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26983" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span>, the first human culture was invented, and this culture developed until it became the corrupted world of Noah. During the time of Noah, God judged the earth by the flood. Noah’s descendants became another race, but this race still did not depend upon God. Eventually, the second human culture came forth, the culture which erected the tower and city of Babel. Then God called Abraham out of that fallen race. By this we can see the development of the two lines. Strictly speaking, the line of life began with Adam, who was fallen and redeemed, and continued through Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and so many Israelites. On this line of life we have the tent of Noah, the tent of Abraham, the tabernacle, and the temple. The line of knowledge began with Cain and continued through all the ungodly people. On the line of knowledge we have the city of Enoch, Babel, Sodom, the treasure cities of Pharaoh, and Babylon, which captured the things on the line of life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="173" id="173">[173]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnmWdwK6oLQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM"> We find the same two lines in the New Testament. Although the Old Testament and the law were originally on the line of life, the Jewish religionists treated them as mere knowledge and put them on the line of knowledge. The Pharisees used the Old Testament in the way of knowledge. When the Lord Jesus came, the religious leaders were altogether on the line of knowledge. Only the Lord Jesus Himself was on the line of life. Then He brought His disciples to the line of life. On the day of Pentecost, His disciples put many other people on the line of life. Thus, at that time, there was the Jewish religion on the line of knowledge and the church on the line of life. However, not long afterward, the church was degraded, falling from the living Christ to dead scriptural knowledge, and became Christianity. The church was on the line of life, but Christianity was on the line of knowledge. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26984" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">Revelation 17</span> tells us that eventually Christianity will become the great, religious Babylon, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26985" data-verses="Revelation 18:1">Revelation 18</span> says that the world system will result in the great political Babylon. The great Babylon will have two aspects—the religious aspect and the political aspect. Regardless of the aspect, the great Babylon is the culmination of the line of knowledge. The overcomers among the Christians through all the centuries never have shifted from the line of life to the line of knowledge. They will remain on the line of life until the end when it ultimately issues in the New Jerusalem. The great Babylon and all things apart from God will be swept away by the stream of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26986" data-verses="Daniel 7:10">Dan. 7:10</span>) into the lake of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26987" data-verses="Revelation 20:10">Rev. 20:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26988" data-verses="Revelation 20:14-15">14-15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="26989" data-verses="Revelation 21:8">21:8</span>). All the positive things in the Bible throughout the ages will be carried on by the river of the water of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26990" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Rev. 22:1</span>) into the New Jerusalem. In opposition to the lake of fire will be a city of water, the New Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26991" data-verses="Revelation 21:10">Rev. 21:10—22:4</span>). At the end of the Bible we see a lake and a city: the lake is the lake of the thirst-creating fire as the ultimate consummation of the line of knowledge; the city is the city of the thirst-quenching water as the ultimate consummation of the line of life. Thus, at the end of the book of Revelation we find the harvest of the seed of the tree of knowledge and of the tree of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-ytt0P2AKBVlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo"> Which line are you on—the line of life or the line of death? <span class="pg" data-page-id="174" id="174">[174]</span> Remember that God is frank. Because life is God, life also is frank. Death, on the contrary, is subtle. Death does not appear manifestly as death; it appears as knowledge. Life is simply life: its contents, nature, and results are life. Death is knowledge. Everyone likes knowledge. Even the little children hunger for it. They weary us with question upon question. If you answer one question, they respond with several more because there is a craving for knowledge within man. Man covets knowledge. Even many Christians are greedy for it. Although the word “knowledge” itself may be a good term, at the back of knowledge and underneath knowledge is death. The letter kills because the letter is knowledge (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="26992" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:6">2 Cor. 3:6</span>). The letter of the Bible kills whenever the Bible is separated from the living God. Religion has separated the Bible from the living Christ. Thus the Bible can kill and spread death. </p>
<p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXQ0zJfoce443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> Death is concealed under so many good things, even lurking under our best intentions. Many dear Christians have been killed by the good intentions of other people. Although your intention may be excellent, Satan lurks beneath it, and Satan is death. Everyone knows that death hides behind evil things. For example, the gambling casinos in Las Vegas are manifestly evil and deadly. However, attending a cathedral seems to be good, much better than visiting a casino. Nevertheless, death is found in both places. The difference is in the appearance, not in the actuality, for death is present and prevailing in both good and evil things. Death is subtle. </p>
<p data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkw_RCeNT-oPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU"> Now we know on which line we should be. We must take the line of life. </p>

The Gospel of John is a book of life. In this Gospel, many human cases are brought to the Lord, and almost every case is an issue of religion, teaching, or questions of right and wrong. As we shall see, the Lord Jesus did not give a yes or no answer to any of the cases. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6PqFabGr9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35">THE LINE OF LIFE<br/>THROUGHOUT THE SCRIPTURES</h1><p data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjItYH9HBcGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD"> In this message I have the burden to cover, as a parenthesis, the principle of the tree of life throughout the Scriptures. We have pointed out many times that almost everything in the first two chapters of Genesis has been sown there as a seed and that this seed grows gradually in the following books of the Bible, appearing as a crop in the New Testament and ripening as a harvest in the book of Revelation. This is a basic principle of the divine Word. God was very economical in writing the Bible, not wasting a single word. He used every word in a most economical way. Furthermore, God’s revelation is consistent throughout the Scriptures. Therefore, whatever we find in the beginning of the Bible we also find throughout the Bible and at the end. </p>
<p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qdWNIw7JdzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> The record of the two trees in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27019" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, the tree of life and the tree of knowledge, is not merely ancient history, for these two trees are still with us today. If we read the Bible carefully, we will discover that throughout the Bible we have two lines—the line of the tree of life and the line of the tree of knowledge. We may refer to them in brief as the line of life and the line of knowledge. These two lines began at the book of Genesis and continue through the subsequent books of the Bible until they reach their destination. As we pointed out in message thirteen, the destination of the line of life will be the New Jerusalem, where the tree of life appears once again. The river of the water of life is also found in the New Jerusalem, for it flows throughout the entire city. Thus, the New Jerusalem, a city of living water, is the ultimate <span class="pg" data-page-id="182" id="182">[182]</span> consummation of the line of the tree of life. The line of knowledge will conclude with the lake of fire, a vivid contrast to the city of New Jerusalem. The city is a city of living water; the lake is a lake of burning fire. </p>
<p data-content-id="aGZQhn44RfDLbiYsGGvVESY8VqaHKCGvuVmdAiPygWOGRgcCG0VL2WETay77K2O7o"> According to the revelation in the Bible, we see two streams proceeding out of the throne of God. One is the stream of living water, and the other is a stream of fire. The stream of living water is revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27020" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:1">Ezekiel 47</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27021" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span>. In Ezekiel living water issues out of the house of God; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27022" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span> living water flows out of the throne of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27023" data-verses="Daniel 7:9-10">Daniel 7:9-10</span> we see another stream, a stream of fire, flowing out of the throne of God. The living water is for reviving and watering, but the stream of fire is for judging. It courses in judgment throughout the universe. The river of water proceeds out of the throne of God and will flow all positive things into the New Jerusalem. The stream of fire issues out of the throne of God and will sweep all negative things into the lake of fire. In the beginning of the Bible we have the start of two lines, the line of life and the line of knowledge. At the end of the Bible we have two results, two consummations—the city of living water and the lake of burning fire. </p>
<p data-content-id="bdPZiOYGTI0GDMWc0r7m5R_wNH6ZCY4FzwTm0_1hM378LkILri-YBA6MHtvxUHmDQ"> Where are you and where are you going? Which line are you on? The line of life is certainly the right line, but the line of knowledge is the wrong line. As redeemed people we are surely on the right line, the line of life. However, it is possible that our walk and our work—that is, the way we live and work for God—might be on the wrong line. Although as persons we may be on the line of life, our walk and work may be on the line of knowledge. The Bible firstly warns people to stay away from the line of knowledge and remain on or return to the line of life. Once we are saved, we are eternally saved, and our salvation is eternally secure. Nevertheless, the Bible warns us concerning our daily walk and our work for the Lord. In Galatians Paul warns us to walk in the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27024" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">5:16</span>) and to sow to the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27025" data-verses="Galatians 6:7-8">6:7-8</span>). Otherwise, everything we do will be consumed by fire. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27026" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span> Paul cautions us, the builders of the churches, to be careful to build with the proper materials. If we build the church with gold, silver, and precious stones, this work will continue unto the <span class="pg" data-page-id="183" id="183">[183]</span> New Jerusalem, because the New Jerusalem is a city built with gold, pearl, and precious stones. On the other hand, Paul warns us that the wood, grass, and straw are only useful for burning (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27027" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:12-15">1 Cor. 3:12-15</span>). Everything that is built with those materials will be swept by the stream of fire into the lake of fire. Thus, we must be careful about ourselves, our walk, and our work. We ourselves must stay on the right line, and our daily walk and work must also be on the right line. Then we and our work will enter the New Jerusalem. We need to be very clear about these two lines. In this message, I shall cover the line of life and in the following message the line of knowledge. </p>
<p data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIISvSGyX3D0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs"> Many times I have been bothered by the fact that the tree of life appeared for a short while in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27028" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> and that it was closed off from man at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27029" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>. Apparently the tree of life has been closed to man; actually through the promised redemption it has been available throughout the ages for God’s people to touch, enjoy, and experience. Now in a very simple way I want to give you many of the positive persons on this line of life. We do not begin with Adam, who was fallen and redeemed. We begin with Abel. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yObOo7LOjjFarxWXeCIo4MA8-U-nfP03Kiwq9oNdUXzgDgrb2yrYAyxlelIIkT9lp">I. ABEL—CONTACTING GOD IN GOD’S WAY</h2><p data-content-id="e4Tu7RSEEn956Bu43KIdFs9FenExLhbqE99G8qhMhliWdoAMPEcx2IgxrawDytCgr"> The characteristic of Abel’s life was that he contacted God in God’s way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27030" data-verses="Genesis 4:4">Gen. 4:4</span>). Do not say that as long as you contact God everything is all right. In whose way do you contact God—in your way or God’s? There are three peoples who claim to contact God: the Jews, the Moslems, and the Christians. The Jews contact God in their own way. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27031" data-verses="Romans 10:2-3">Romans 10:2-3</span>, the Jews seek to establish their own righteousness and do not submit to the righteousness of God. This means that they contact God in their own way. The Moslems are even more devoted to their own way of worshipping God. If you visit a Moslem mosque, you will find that the Moslems appear pious and godly, worshipping God by bowing themselves. Many so-called Christians, including Catholics, do their service to God according to their own way, not through the redemption of Christ, nor in the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_LVfeUOBYw3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj"> What is the origin of man’s own way of contacting God? <span class="pg" data-page-id="184" id="184">[184]</span> The source is man’s troublesome mind, which can produce nothing except knowledge. Hence, men contact God in the way of knowledge, not in the way of life. Abel, however, contacted God in His way. As we shall see in the following message, his elder brother, Cain, contacted God in his own way. God’s way is life; Cain’s way is knowledge. We all need to be careful. Although you may say that you are for God, perhaps you are for God in your own way. You approach God in your self-invented way, and that way is entirely a matter of knowledge. Do not follow that way. We should observe the example of Abel and contact God by laying aside our thought, opinion, and concept. “Lord, I contact You in Your way. I don’t contact You by my thought, concept, or knowledge. Lord, You are my way.” If we do this, we will enjoy God as the tree of life. Abel did partake of God as the tree of life. He truly ate of the fruit of this tree. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZgg_rVhsp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6">THE LINE OF KNOWLEDGE<br/>THROUGHOUT THE SCRIPTURES</h1><p data-content-id="BLE5KA_UJUWmNHemF8RznMy2eqIh0O1klPDPPz_cM4ETPjCdTs_KDy-6YMjsxBV2U"> We have seen that the Bible opens with two trees, the tree of life, which brings in life, and the tree of knowledge, which brings in knowledge. However, knowledge is a pretense, for the tree of knowledge actually is the tree of death and brings in death. Thus, from the very beginning of the Bible we see two lines which continue throughout the entire Bible. The first line is the line of life, beginning with the tree of life and continuing throughout the Scriptures until it ends at the city of New Jerusalem, where we also see the tree of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27103" data-verses="Revelation 22:1-2">Rev. 22:1-2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27104" data-verses="Revelation 22:14">14</span>). The second line is the line of knowledge, beginning with the tree of knowledge and continuing throughout the Scriptures until it ends at the lake of fire. In this message we shall consider the line of knowledge throughout the Scriptures. In every book of the Bible we can see the knowledge that troubles, damages, kills, and destroys. Now we shall examine many cases of people who lived, worked, moved, and acted by knowledge, not by life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="x52sBK0RPP8CO8qDhR2srrfOtm0q0DNKTmsXdJCAVgGjfw6s5s9H5KtPnduIvZkRU">I. CAIN</h2><p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2MxGImmViDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> Cain, the first son of Adam and the second generation of mankind, was the first person to live according to knowledge. Cain brought the fruit of the ground as an offering to the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27105" data-verses="Genesis 4:3">Gen. 4:3</span>). Although this appears to be very good, it was wrong because Cain presented an offering to God <em>in his own way,</em> not in God’s way. God’s way required that fallen man offer a redeeming sacrifice in order to contact Him. However, Cain only offered the fruit of the ground without the <span class="pg" data-page-id="198" id="198">[198]</span> redeeming blood. Cain’s offering was presented according to his own consideration in his mind. It was offered in his own way. Every such way originates with the human mind. We must be careful. As we have pointed out, the principle of the tree of knowledge is to be independent of God. It means that we make our decisions independently. Although Cain performed a good deed, it was independent of God. Everything that is good yet independent of God results in death. This is similar to insulation which severs the flow of electricity. Regardless of the substance that is used as insulation—it may even be diamond—electricity is cut off nonetheless. As long as it causes insulation, it does not matter whether the material is good or bad. Likewise, if a thing keeps us away from God, it brings death, regardless of how good it is. </p>
<p data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQcyFHqMfFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B"> As a consequence of acting independently Cain went out from the presence of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27106" data-verses="Genesis 4:16">Gen. 4:16</span>). That was dreadful. It does not matter how good we are, for if we are away from the presence of God it is awful. We may be either good or bad, but the issue is the same as long as we are out of the presence of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="QMSNPOcCBLw6v-EOydvwYFFtIt8TduX4YH5_O01lRUzkJdbjHu_x8PZ2HwO74uIjb"> Once people have acted in their own way and have left the presence of God, they desire to erect a building for themselves. Cain built a city and called it Enoch, after the name of his son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27107" data-verses="Genesis 4:17">Gen. 4:17</span>). Cain did not name the city after the name of God; he made a name for mankind. This was a declaration that man was independent of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7Wm7Oenz93ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo">II. NIMROD</h2><p data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjItUH8TpcGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD"> Nimrod was a mighty hunter before the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27108" data-verses="Genesis 10:8-11">Gen. 10:8-11</span>). He was a mighty one in the earth, a person who was absolutely independent of God. He built a kingdom for himself, and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel. Although many Christians know that mankind constructed the tower and city of Babel, few realize that the kingdom of Babel was formed by Nimrod. The first kingdom in human history was probably the kingdom of Babel formed by Nimrod, who also built the great city of Nineveh in Assyria. His building was a sign that mankind was completely independent of God. Abraham, on the contrary, did not build anything but a little altar. He <span class="pg" data-page-id="199" id="199">[199]</span> dwelt in a tent. Noah likewise did not build anything except the ark and an altar. The people who put their trust in God do not engage in much building activity. The more we place our confidence in God, the less independent building we will have. Only the giant workers—those who are independent of God—will construct their high towers. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qdWBIx_ldzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S">III. THE PEOPLE AT BABEL</h2><p data-content-id="aGZQhn44RfDLbiYsGGvVESYwVrunKCGvuVmdAiPygWOGRgcCG0VL2WETay77K2O7o"> The people at Babel held a council (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27109" data-verses="Genesis 11:3">Gen. 11:3</span>). They did not pray nor ask the Lord what they should do or where they should go. Human history is a history of councils. After World War I the League of Nations was formed, and this league was actually a council. After the end of World War II the League of Nations was changed into the United Nations, which has a huge building in New York where council is held nearly every day. Such human councils are utterly independent of God. The result of the council at Babel was the construction of a high tower for man’s name and the formation of a city for his possession (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27110" data-verses="Genesis 11:4">Gen. 11:4</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bdPZiOYGTI0GDMWc0r7m5R_8NGe9CY4FzwTm0_1hM378LkILri-YBA6MHtvxUHmDQ">IV. LOT</h2><p data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIISveGwDPD0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs"> Although Lot was a saved person, he drifted away from the line of life by making a choice according to his own sight (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27111" data-verses="Genesis 13:10-11">Gen. 13:10-11</span>; cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27112" data-verses="Genesis 13:14-15">vv. 14-15</span>). When Lot separated himself from Abraham, he lifted up his eyes, looked at the plain of the Jordan, and made a decision according to his own sight. He did not pray, “Lord, I do not know what I should do. What should I do? Lord have mercy on me. Take Your choice. I want to take Your choice.” Lot did not pray in this way, but made a choice according to the sight of his eyes. As a result, he moved toward the evil city of Sodom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27113" data-verses="Genesis 13:12-13">Gen. 13:12-13</span>; cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27114" data-verses="Genesis 13:18">v. 18</span>). Whenever you take a course in independence of God, be assured that your way will be downward. Your way will be in the direction of the sinful city of Sodom. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yObOo7LOjjFarxWXeCIo4MAw-W6bfP03Kiwq9oNdUXzgDgrb2yrYAyxlelIIkT9lp">V. ESAU</h2><p data-content-id="8UouUokiSDmfQ5btvmO_u9SdcwGkLW5y_xM7y0Cjh31lO6uhzd5IR1LXaUCBwG1Zr"> If we read the history of Esau, we find that, ethically speaking, he did nothing wrong. Jacob seemed to have been much worse. Esau, however, was a hunter, hunting for his own <span class="pg" data-page-id="200" id="200">[200]</span> satisfaction (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27115" data-verses="Genesis 25:27">Gen. 25:27</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27116" data-verses="Genesis 25:29">29</span>). Esau hunted independently of God. Eventually, for the purpose of satisfying his appetite, he sold his birthright (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27117" data-verses="Genesis 25:30-34">Gen. 25:30-34</span>). All the people who are independent of God have sold their human birthright, the enjoyment of God. Since God created man in His own image to be His expression, it means that, by birth, man has the right to express God. Thus, every human being has a birthright, the right by birth to express God. However, nearly everyone has sold his birthright because of his independence. What does it mean to repent and believe in the Lord Jesus? Repentance means to have a change in our thinking, in our mentality. Formerly, I was moving in a certain direction with my back turned toward God. After I heard the gospel I turned around. This is the meaning of repentance. To believe in the Lord Jesus means to come back to our human birthright, to come back to the enjoyment of God and to the expression of God. This is the meaning of repentance and belief in the Lord Jesus. Esau did not do this, but moved in the opposite direction. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0JV8hDILxxkbeRl9MfljI4tjqx7xVL0iYCHdxKUekJ14F8oFrW_U5yl_qzhcrk_AB">VI. PHARAOH</h2><p data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYQq80VkstMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27118" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">Exodus 1—12</span> we see how independent Pharaoh was. He was not only independent; he was rebellious against God, even asking on one occasion, “Who is God?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27119" data-verses="Exodus 5:2">Exo. 5:2</span>). Pharaoh did not care for God and he was unwilling to know God. Thus, Pharaoh’s heart was hardened. He hardened his heart and even God hardened his heart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27120" data-verses="Exodus 7:13">Exo. 7:13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27121" data-verses="Exodus 7:22">22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27122" data-verses="Exodus 8:15">8:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27123" data-verses="Exodus 8:19">19</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27124" data-verses="Exodus 8:32">32</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27125" data-verses="Exodus 9:34-35">9:34-35</span>). Again and again and again the heart of Pharaoh was hardened. The people throughout the world today are hardened in their heart because they do not care for God. They care about their councils, plans and plots, but they do not care for God. Thus, God lets go of them and their hearts become hardened. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="oojwSJGvLbmiYj5tIQGoqZgIH5r44PdhX0jmIOM9tm0WtyG5HMI5sjMdIyAZ1hq_3">TO WORK GOD INTO MAN AS LIFE</h1><p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQbpEtrnF8HTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> In this message we come to the last part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27193" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>. Although <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27194" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span> are quite brief, they contain many basic items. We have previously pointed out that nearly every item in these two chapters is a seed of divine truth, and that these seeds require the entire Bible to expound and develop them. The divine revelation in the Bible unveils spiritual things, and these spiritual things are mysterious, abstract, and, humanly speaking, unsubstantial. Due to our limited ability to understand them, God was forced to disclose His divine revelation in the way of picture and allegory. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27195" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> was written in a figurative way, and all the items found therein are figures. We should not understand them merely according to the outward letters, but probe into the inner sense of the figures. Both the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are figures. What is the tree of life? It is difficult for people to understand. Nevertheless, it is the tree of life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27196" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we also find a river, and at the flow of this river we have gold, pearl, and onyx stone. What do all of these things signify? What do they mean? As we have seen in earlier messages, all of them are figures and compose an allegory. </p>
<p data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYgw5EsfU65oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa"> Humanly speaking, the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27197" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> is easy to understand because it relates the story of a marriage. Adam was created, but he had no wife. Thus, God provided a wife for him. This does not sound allegorical. If we only read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27198" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we will not recognize it as an allegory. However, if we read through the whole Bible, we will realize that the marriage found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27199" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> is indeed an allegory. Why do we say this? <span class="pg" data-page-id="214" id="214">[214]</span> Because later in the Old Testament God told His people, “For thy Maker is thine Husband” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27200" data-verses="Isaiah 54:5">Isa. 54:5</span>). Man’s Creator is his Husband, meaning that in the universe the unique man is God Himself. The man created by God actually is not a man, but a woman. I have a question to address to all the men reading this message: are you male or female? I am a female. I am a female because I am part of the wife. Firstly, God was my Creator. Secondly, He became my Redeemer. Now He is my Husband. </p>
<p data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0ZLDJYpm8onn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF"> This concept is thoroughly developed and expounded in the New Testament. Although many people think of Jesus Christ as a great teacher and others regard Him as their Savior, the four Gospels also reveal Him as the Bridegroom. Undoubtedly He is a teacher and the Savior. However, He is also the Bridegroom come to receive the bride (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27201" data-verses="John 3:29">John 3:29</span>). One day the disciples of John came to the Lord Jesus, asking Him why His disciples did not fast (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27202" data-verses="Matthew 9:14-15">Matt. 9:14-15</span>). In His answer the Lord Jesus revealed Himself as the Bridegroom. The Lord asked them, “Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?” Furthermore, Paul, the greatest apostle, told us clearly that the church is the wife and that Christ is the husband. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27203" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span> he said, “I betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.” Thus, we are a wife to Christ. Moreover, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27204" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span> Paul speaks of marriage, saying that when a man is joined to his wife the two become one flesh. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27205" data-verses="Ephesians 5:32">Ephesians 5:32</span> Paul says that marriage signifies the great mystery concerning Christ and the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="YWQf39oOaKT-w18LKhlsjp9cn9AsDjHh52RJBmzJk0PH2LSkAzFUEZelzC01-ioTH"> Adam in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27206" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> was a type, a prefigure of Christ. Speaking figuratively, we may say that Adam was Christ. When we see Adam in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27207" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, we see Christ. What then does Eve signify? Apparently she was only a woman, Adam’s wife. However, if we have the spiritual vision from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27208" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span>, we will see that Eve in the garden was a prefigure of the church. If we have this perspective, we will realize that whatever happened to Adam in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27209" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> was an experience of Christ and that whatever happened to Eve was related to the church. We must understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27210" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> in this way. In figure, Adam was Christ and Eve was the church. <span class="pg" data-page-id="215" id="215">[215]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="E-xv1nlZl2LrnNkDtbmzOf4udsG6tUIFb3C0mvDz1LtjokSWkphwKc-Ng-yoBiibt"> This is similar to the photograph of a person. Suppose I have a photograph of Brother John. If I show you the photograph and ask you who it is, you will be correct if you say that it is Brother John. However, we must be careful, for although it is a picture of Brother John, it is not the real person of Brother John. It is simply a photograph of Brother John, depicting his appearance and giving you some idea of what he is like. Likewise, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27211" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we see a figure or picture of Christ and the church in the types of Adam and Eve. When we examine the picture of Adam and Eve, we understand how the church comes into existence. It will be difficult to understand this if we simply talk about Christ and the church; however, if we look at the picture, we will be very clear. The picture saves a great many words. If I describe Brother John to you, using many words, it would still be difficult for you to picture what he is like. However, if I show you his photograph, you will immediately be clear about him. Although the photograph is not the real person, it does afford you some understanding of the person, relieving you of the need to guess. God uses the picture of Adam and Eve in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27212" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> to give us a definite revelation of Christ and the church. Without this chapter we could never understand the relationship between Christ and the church so exactly. This picture shows how the church came into being. </p>
<p data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2yySOa0hY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df"> Please remember that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27213" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span> unveil two main things. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27214" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> reveals God’s eternal purpose, which is to express Himself through man and to exercise His dominion with man. Man was created to express God and to represent God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27215" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> continues by showing the way to fulfill God’s purpose. Although God has a purpose, He must have a means of fulfilling it. What is God’s divine way of accomplishing His purpose? As we have seen, His way is life. God desires to come into us as life. In order to accomplish His purpose, God wants to come into man to be man’s life and life supply. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27216" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> reveals that God’s procedure involves three steps. The first step was for God to create man as a vessel to contain Him as life. Since man was made as a vessel to contain God, man can live by Him, express Him, and represent Him. As the second step, God placed man in front of the tree <span class="pg" data-page-id="216" id="216">[216]</span> of life. We have seen that the tree of life represents God Himself. In placing man before the tree of life, God was indicating that He wanted man to take Him into his being that he might be transformed into the precious materials for the building up of the church. </p>

The first step was to make the vessel, the second was to put this vessel in front of the tree of life, and the third is to work God into man as life. How can God work Himself into man as life? Praise the Lord that we have an allegory to help us understand. We need to have a clear view of this allegory. Although you are familiar with the story of Adam’s marriage, perhaps you have never been impressed with its significance. </p>

These two books also reveal how the enemy, the subtle one, came in and how he will be cast out. The so-called modern critics, who do not believe in the Bible, mainly direct their attacks at the books of Genesis and Revelation. When we were young this higher criticism was quite prevailing, and we fought against it. The higher critics attacked the books of Genesis and Revelation because the subtle serpent within them knew that no other books exposed him as much. If you want to know how the serpent came in and what his destiny will be, you need to read the first chapters of Genesis and the last chapters of Revelation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27275" data-verses="Revelation 12:9">Revelation 12:9</span> mentions “the ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan.” The word “ancient” that describes the serpent refers to the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27276" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>. Therefore, if we did not have the books of Genesis and Revelation, the subtle serpent would not be fully exposed. Thus, the serpent invented the so-called modern criticism in an attempt to discredit these two books. </p>
<p data-content-id="topU0NZPOs7b25ters3Gd5W9K3mthSqSpV5hz_XoXr_MU93J_kJdBBom0evJv9lGi"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27277" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span> we see a garden and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27278" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span> we see a city. By transformation and building the garden becomes a city. Between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27279" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27280" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span> are many ages or dispensations. The serpent first appeared in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27281" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> and he has been active ever since; he never sleeps. Throughout all the generations since <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27282" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> the serpent has been working constantly. If you read through the entire Bible carefully, you will see that the serpent came in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27283" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> and that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27284" data-verses="Revelation 20:10">Revelation 20:10</span> he will be cast into the lake of fire. Regardless of the age or dispensation Satan has <span class="pg" data-page-id="228" id="228">[228]</span> always been active. In the first dispensation, meaning the first way in which God dealt with man, Satan was there. Satan not only corrupted the first human couple, but has corrupted man in every succeeding dispensation. When God initiated another age or dispensation, Satan was there to damage people. Throughout age after age and dispensation after dispensation Satan has been present, making it appear as if God has been unable to handle the situation. But this is not so. God is great. We only need to give Him a little time. As far as God is concerned, a thousand years are equal to a day. The period of time from Adam’s creation until now is actually less than six days to God. We need to be patient with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="h08U91ltZnqTUI0aV0g56niCiJICCw-cZTKHrVo12qTwS3OgmpjHqkUk9BKO83GId"> As we come to the church dispensation, we see the strongest conflict between Satan and man. What a battle is raging! The book of Revelation shows us that in the churches God has gained a group of overcomers who will defeat Satan. At the end of this dispensation the Lord Jesus will return in victory. The Lord Jesus has been unable to return because as yet there has been no victorious ground on which He can set His feet. He is waiting for this. The overcomers will establish a beachhead for the glorious Christ to return in a victorious way. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27285" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span>, Satan firstly will be defeated by the overcomers. Then, at the time of the Lord’s return, Satan will be bound and cast into the bottomless pit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27286" data-verses="Revelation 20:1-3">Rev. 20:1-3</span>). Eventually and ultimately he will be cast into the lake of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27287" data-verses="Revelation 20:10">Rev. 20:10</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWIhfBFM2tXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27288" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> Satan came in and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27289" data-verses="Revelation 20:1">Revelation 20</span> he will be cast out. Immediately after the first two chapters of Genesis Satan came in, and immediately before the last two chapters of Revelation he will be cast out. Thus, in the entire Bible there are just four chapters in which we see no footprints of the contaminating enemy. Apart from these four chapters he has polluted every age and space. Only <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27290" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27291" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span> are free from Satan’s contamination.

Have you ever noticed that Satan appeared immediately after the first two chapters of Genesis and that he will be cast into the lake of fire prior to the last <span class="pg" data-page-id="229" id="229">[229]</span> two chapters of Revelation? In this message we want to consider how this crafty one first came in. </p>
<p data-content-id="MtCll2XOY8R8dFgTUXdR4aNs7V878JwNRjNJM9TIVoQfsRCA1WYTsZI35lh9oQ1PX"> As we have seen, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27294" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> reveals God’s eternal purpose and heart’s desire, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27295" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> reveals God’s way of fulfilling His purpose. However, before God could accomplish His purpose, Satan came in. In everything Satan tries to be first. Anything that is real can afford to be somewhat slow, but that which is false always moves hastily. Therefore, in regard to many things it is better for us to do nothing at the first instance. Suppose a little boy comes to his father and says, “Daddy, I want to buy a new toy.” The father should answer, “Son, wait for two days. Let us see what the Lord will say.” Perhaps it is even better to wait an additional two days. Since Satan is always in a rush we should never accept the first proposal. If a brother comes to you seeking an answer regarding a certain matter, do not reply immediately. Perhaps that question is an instance of the rushing activity of Satan. You need to wait awhile. After a few days that brother might change his mind. I have seen this happen many times. The disposition of young men and young ladies is very quick; they have a hasty temperament. They like to act swiftly and get answers immediately. This haste has its origin in the subtle serpent. If you will wait, God will come in. In most things God is not present at the first instance. The serpent will always act ahead of God in an attempt to defeat Him. </p>

Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27297" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>, the first mention of Satan’s activity, reveals the principle that Satan comes in before God. </p>

Even some non-Christians know about Adam and Eve’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="230" id="230">[230]</span> eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge. However, not many people, including Christians, know the significance of man’s first fall. Hence, we must approach this subject from three directions. First, we must determine the cause of the fall. What was the cause, the basic factor, of man’s first fall? Second, we must learn the process, the way in which the first fall transpired. Third, we need to discover the result of man’s first fall. This is my burden in this message. I realize that it is a difficult message to give because of the battle that is raging. The enemy is within us. Even the knowledge that we already have of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27299" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> may frustrate us from penetrating into the depths of this chapter. We must probe into the depths of the significance of man’s first fall and not look at it superficially. </p>

This is correct. However, we should not place the entire blame upon Satan. As we shall see, the cause of man’s first fall was not primarily on Satan’s side, but on man’s side. We may use the illustration of catching a cold. In order to catch a cold you must have cold air. However, cold air itself is insufficient to cause a cold. You need to have the cold germs. A chair cannot catch a cold even if it is exposed to a chilly draft because it is unaffected by cold germs. It is easy for people to catch a cold because we have cold germs. We should not put all the blame on the cold air, for most of the blame belongs to the cold germs. Likewise, we should not blame Satan for the fall, since much of the responsibility rests with man. Nevertheless, I have put Satan as the first cause of man’s fall. Satan was the initial factor in this fall. Satan is simply Satan. We should never expect him to be better or different. </p>

The so-called higher critics, who attacked the book of Genesis and Revelation, also claimed that Jesus was not born of a virgin, alleging that He was born of Joseph, the carpenter. Such an assertion is the greatest blasphemy against the Lord Jesus. The Lord was not the son of that carpenter who later became the husband of the virgin Mary, of which virgin Jesus was born. Thus, Jesus was not the seed of any man; He was the seed of a woman, a virgin, as prophesied in Isaiah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27354" data-verses="Isaiah 7:14">7:14</span>), fulfilled in Matthew (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27355" data-verses="Matthew 1:23">1:23</span>), and confirmed by Paul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27356" data-verses="Galatians 4:4">Gal. 4:4</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27357" data-verses="Galatians 4:4">Galatians 4:4</span> Paul says that Christ was born of a woman. Therefore, Jesus was not the seed of man.

God did not judge man. Immediately after the fall both Adam and Eve realized that they were not very good. They condemned themselves, hid themselves, and used fig leaves to cover themselves (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27359" data-verses="Genesis 3:7-8">Gen. 3:7-8</span>). Adam and Eve hid themselves from the presence of God. They knew that they had violated God’s prohibition against eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge and that the result of their transgression was to be death. Therefore, they hid themselves from the Lord’s presence, awaiting the sentence of death. However, God came in, not to declare the sentence of death, but to preach the gospel. God did not pronounce the sentence of death; He sounded the voice of the gospel. </p>

It was the question found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27360" data-verses="Genesis 3:9">Genesis 3:9</span>: “Where art thou?” In the earlier years of my ministry when I preached the gospel I used this question as my topic several times. I asked people, “Where are you? Gentlemen, where are you? Ladies, where are you? Young people, doctors, professors—where are you? You must know where you are.” This question is not the pronouncement of a judgment; it is the opening proclamation of the glad tidings. God was seeking man, asking, “Where art thou?” </p>

However, in his answer he acknowledged that he was naked (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27361" data-verses="Genesis 3:10">v. 10</span>). Then God asked him, “Who told thee that thou was naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?” Adam should have made an honest confession, saying, “Yes, <span class="pg" data-page-id="245" id="245">[245]</span> God, I did eat of it. Please forgive me.” However, instead of forthrightly confessing his own transgression, he discharged himself of the responsibility by placing it upon the woman. Adam said, “The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27362" data-verses="Genesis 3:12">v. 12</span>). His answer implied that he blamed God for giving him the woman who gave him to eat of the fruit of the tree. Only then did he admit that he ate it. Adam seemed to be saying, “It’s not my fault, God. You must bear the responsibility for the trouble caused by the woman You gave me. If You hadn’t given me the woman, I would never have eaten of that tree. You gave me the woman, she gave me to eat, and I ate.” Nevertheless, God did not rebuke him, because God had not come to judge but to save. God came to man in the garden in the same way that His Son was to come many centuries later: He came to save, not to judge (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27363" data-verses="John 3:17">John 3:17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="LD01-v3um3NuLShGttlViqm2nW7MRg9jsTHcyuTXlEDKbBHncuqREEkOSwGaFv9xn"> Then God turned to the woman asking, “What is this that thou hast done?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27364" data-verses="Genesis 3:13">v. 13</span>). Like Adam, Eve did not forthrightly confess her fault. She said, “The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.” Ever since the time of man’s first fall, human beings have acted in this way. Whenever little children misbehave, they never confess, but always blame someone or something else. A child may even place the responsibility on the pet cat, saying, “Mommy, if you did not have a cat, I would never have done that thing. It’s not my fault. It’s yours for having a cat.” </p>
<p data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD0Xu90CL7iWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP"> It is very clear that as God dealt with the first fall of man He was seeking the lost man as His Son was to do many years later in seeking to save man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27365" data-verses="Luke 19:10">Luke 19:10</span>). God did not seek him to condemn man, but to preach the gospel to him. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROmLDRTljOOlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX">b. Judging the Serpent</h2><p data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9BnbphLAW6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr"> When God came to Adam and Eve He asked them questions, but when He turned to the serpent He asked no questions at all. He immediately condemned the serpent. God did not ask the serpent, “Serpent, have you done this?” When God came to Adam He asked him, “Where art thou?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27366" data-verses="Genesis 3:9">v. 9</span>). He also asked him, “Who told thee that thou wast naked?” and “Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27367" data-verses="Genesis 3:11">v. 11</span>). God also asked the woman, <span class="pg" data-page-id="246" id="246">[246]</span> “What is this that thou hast done?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27368" data-verses="Genesis 3:13">v. 13</span>). God did not ask Adam and Eve all these questions because He had the intention of condemning them. God asked these questions to lead them to confession. However, when God turned to the serpent He did not ask him anything. Instead, God said to the serpent, “Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27369" data-verses="Genesis 3:14">v. 14</span>). This was God’s judgment upon the serpent. </p>

In this curse pronounced upon the serpent something is hidden and implied. As God judged the serpent, He limited Satan’s activity and move to the earth. A bird is free and can soar in the air whenever it wishes. The serpent, on the contrary, has no such freedom, but is restricted to the earth. As long as we are above the earth, the serpent, the Devil, Satan, cannot touch us. When we are transcendent, we are over him. However, if we also creep on the earth, we will be where he is. We will become his companion and creep together with him and all the other creeping things. But we are not creeping on this earth—we are transcendent. </p>

Dust is the serpent’s food. We were made from dust. If we are earthy, living in an earthy manner, we become the serpent’s food and he will devour us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27370" data-verses="1Peter 5:8">1 Pet. 5:8</span>). If you are an earthy person, dealing with your wife or living with your husband in an earthy way, you will immediately become food for the Devil. Many families are completely swallowed up by the Devil because they are so earthy. Why does it seem that your marriage life is being devoured by the Devil? Because your marriage life is earthy and full of dust. <span class="pg" data-page-id="247" id="247">[247]</span> </p>

As we saw in the last message, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27461" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span> is the gospel. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27462" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span> is the first occurrence of the proclamation of the gospel in the entire Bible. In this verse God Himself preached the glad tidings to fallen man in judging the serpent. Therefore, we need to spend more time on this verse. </p>
<p data-content-id="CAIiqFyjjgw0LbNxWLi5D9Yf-xyGcXq_WajUO0fMiI1qsIetqtq6bkTvknnO7bFYb"> I have mentioned several times in previous messages that nearly everything found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27463" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-3">Genesis 1 through 3</span> is a seed that grows throughout the following books of the Bible, appearing as a crop in the Epistles of the New Testament and ripening into a harvest in the book of Revelation. We have seen this principle applied to many items. In this message I want to point out this principle once again as we consider the three main items found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27464" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>: the serpent, the woman, and the seed of the woman. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KaZThnQr7e1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1">I. THE SERPENT</h2><p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_SwU1C-JgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> As we read through the Scriptures, we find the serpent is not only mentioned in Genesis, but also in other books of the Bible. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27465" data-verses="Revelation 12:9">Revelation 12:9</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27466" data-verses="Revelation 20:2">20:2</span> both refer to the serpent. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27467" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27468" data-verses="Revelation 20:1">20</span> we find that Satan has various names—the dragon, the ancient serpent, the Devil, and Satan. Among these names we find the title “the ancient serpent.” John uses this term because at the time he wrote the book of Revelation the serpent had become very old, in fact, at least four thousand years old. Who is this “ancient serpent”? The only way to answer this question is to consult the third chapter of Genesis where the serpent is first mentioned. <span class="pg" data-page-id="258" id="258">[258]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="prNfLWZ9JdrW7yTc3YS3U_vf_o1moK-lAf5XbjI5e4-Pr6RDr_aquY_gO4K9YJN2U"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27469" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span> we find another reference to the serpent. When Nicodemus, a high-class gentleman of superior attainment, came to the Lord Jesus in a positive way, the Lord told him that he needed a new birth with a new life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27470" data-verses="John 3:3">John 3:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27471" data-verses="John 3:5">5</span>). The Lord told him that his human spirit needed to be reborn of the Holy Spirit, for “that which is born of the Spirit is spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27472" data-verses="John 3:6">John 3:6</span>). However, not many Christians have observed that in His conversation with Nicodemus the Lord pointed that gentleman to the serpent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27473" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span>). Although Nicodemus was a gentleman, a teacher, and a “master of Israel,” the Lord indicated that he was a serpent. </p>
<p data-content-id="vGPkFtfe7Aen3iGIVhF4DcWnr6BhJoSKHjShQRi-Q6TFheMiOa11sXw6WrcmFYS61"> At a certain point in His conversation with Nicodemus the Lord Jesus said, “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.” What does this mean? It was the Lord’s answer to Nicodemus’s question. Nicodemus had asked, “How can a man be born when he is old?” and, “How can these things be?” Nicodemus was asking how he could be born again. The Lord replied, “You are the teacher of Israel, and you don’t know these things?” Although Nicodemus taught the Old Testament to the people, he did not know the meaning of being born again. Therefore, the Lord referred to the type of the brass serpent lifted up on a pole by Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27474" data-verses="Numbers 21:9">Num. 21:9</span>). The Lord seemed to be saying to him, “Your fathers were all bitten by poisonous serpents, and the poison of the serpents entered into them. Your fathers became serpents in the eyes of God. Because they were dying, Moses prayed to God on their behalf, and God told Moses to lift up a brass serpent on a pole to bear His judgment upon the poisoned Israelites. Everyone who had been poisoned by the serpents and who looked to the brass serpent lifted up on the pole lived.” Many of the Israelites did this, and their lives were preserved. This is a type of regeneration. The Lord seemed to be telling Nicodemus, “Don’t consider yourself as a gentleman. You must realize that you are one of the people who has been poisoned by the serpent and that you have the serpentine nature within you. Apparently you are a man; actually you are a serpent. In the eyes of God you are one of the serpents. Although you are a serpent, I have come to die for you. I shall die on the cross in the form of <span class="pg" data-page-id="259" id="259">[259]</span> the serpent. When I am on the cross, in the eyes of God I shall not only be a substitute for sinners; I shall be judged there by God in the form of the serpent. The only difference is that the real serpent has poison, but I shall only be in the form of the serpent. I do not have the nature and the poison of the serpent. I have come in the likeness of the flesh of sin, in the form of the serpent, to die for all of you who have been poisoned by the serpent.” </p>
<p data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKQhCUn3g_CaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI"> The first mention of the serpent in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27475" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> is a seed that is developed in subsequent books of the Bible. We see the serpent in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27476" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> and also in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27477" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span>. Nearly all Christians have seen the eternal life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27478" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>, but not many have seen the serpent in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27479" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span>. However, if we are to understand what is eternal life, we must also understand what is the serpent. We must see the serpent. The serpent is not only in Genesis and John but is fully exposed in the book of Revelation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27480" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span> the serpent is a little seed, in the Gospel of John this seed grows, and in the book of Revelation this seed becomes a harvest. By reading throughout the Bible we can see that in every generation God’s divine work has had a goal: to build up the Body to express His Son, Christ, and also to eliminate the serpent. God intends to expel the serpent. Therefore, we all must realize where the serpent is today. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnCH081SPEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB">A. Having Injected Himself into Mankind</h2><p data-content-id="4ih-7ivO1f_Uex_xN1d2zI9tdJq1CD7MrPWGnia394uU8LdMUmJUsII4OLzctGMcQ"> Through the fall of man the serpent injected himself into mankind. Where is this serpent now? He is in our flesh. In the garden, before the fall of man, the serpent was outside of man. However, since the fall, the subtle, crafty serpent is in man, in his flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="oojwSJGvLbmiYj5tIQGoqZQUH5Pc4PdhX0jmIOM9tm0WtyG5HMI5sjMdIyAZ1hq_3"> One day the Lord Jesus asked His disciples, “Who do you say that I am?” and Peter immediately responded, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27481" data-verses="Matthew 16:15-16">Matt. 16:15-16</span>). A short time after this the Lord rebuked Peter, calling him “Satan” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27482" data-verses="Matthew 16:23">Matt. 16:23</span>). Can you believe that one minute he was a holy Peter and that soon afterward he had become Satan? If I had been Andrew, Peter’s brother, I would have asked the Lord Jesus, “Where is Satan? I am Andrew, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="260" id="260">[260]</span> Peter is my brother, but where is Satan?” The Lord Jesus might have answered, “Satan is here within him. Satan is inside of Peter.” When you speak in an evil way, who are you? You are Satan. When you act in a mean way with your wife or husband, who are you? Satan. At such a time the Lord Jesus could say of you, “Satan!” Where is Satan? He is within fallen mankind. Satan today is in man’s flesh. We all must be on the alert because Satan, the one who tempted and damaged the first generation of mankind, is now within us. </p>

The Discipline of Man by Suffering</h2><p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6PaVaaGr9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> As we have seen, after man fell God did not come to condemn him, but to seek him and to judge the serpent. In His condemnation on the serpent God proclaimed the promise regarding the seed of the woman (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27572" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Gen. 3:15</span>). However, that was not the end. Although God had proclaimed the promise of His salvation, man still remained in a troubled situation. Not only was man in a difficult situation, but a sinful element had been injected into his nature. Therefore, man is both sinful outwardly and also corrupted inwardly. God had no intention of condemning man. All that God had in His heart toward man was love, and man was fully under God’s loving care. Thus, God ordained some suffering for man’s benefit. Although we do not like suffering, God has ordained it nonetheless. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjIdIH-HBcGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD">1) The Purpose</h2><p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qdmdIz7JdzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> What is the purpose of the sufferings ordained by God? The primary purpose is to restrict man. The sufferings appointed by God are actually our security and protection. Never forget that as a result of the fall man has a corrupted and corrupting element in his nature. God loves man and exercises a loving concern over him, but man still has a satanic element in his nature. Immediately after the fall man probably did not realize his true condition; however, God understood the problem and thus He ordained sufferings for <span class="pg" data-page-id="272" id="272">[272]</span> the purpose of restricting fallen man. Young people throughout the world want freedom; they desire to have their liberty. Nevertheless, we must realize that too much freedom removes the restrictions that God, in His love, has placed upon us. As fallen men with a corrupted nature, we definitely need restrictions as a protection and safeguard. Suppose a mother has a naughty boy. If she does not exercise any restrictions over him, that child would not live for three days. He would kill himself as a result of having too much freedom. No mother is so foolish as to give complete liberty to a naughty child. All children need restrictions. Restrictions are good for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KaZTlnRfTe1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> As an older person I need to be and I love to be restricted by my dear brothers in the Lord. I am restricted even more by the sisters. Actually I have very little freedom. If you were to offer me freedom, I would say, “No thank you. You take your freedom home with you. I need restriction.” How I thank the Lord that in all the past years I have been protected by restrictions. I have not suffered under the restriction of the saints, but have rather enjoyed it. All the limitations rendered to me by my brothers and sisters in the Lord have been my protection. Although, at present, you may not think that restrictions are pleasant, after the passing of years I believe that you will worship the Lord and say, “Thank the Lord for restrictions!” </p>
<p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_SwQ1DalgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> Let me say a word about husbands and wives. No woman likes to be restricted. The dear sisters may be holy and seek after spirituality, but I do not believe that they are fond of being restricted. A wife does not like to accept any restraint from her husband or mother-in-law. I have learned from history and from experience that not many daughters-in-law like their mothers-in-law. It seems that this comes from God’s ordination. God ordained that the mother-in-law be a restriction to the daughter-in-law and that the daughter-in-law be a problem to the mother-in-law. Humanly speaking, this does not sound pleasant, but actually it is good. Any sister who is willing to accept restrictions from her husband, children, and mother-in-law will be protected. </p>
<p data-content-id="prNfLWZ9JdrW7yTc3YS3U_vb_qhGoK-lAf5XbjI5e4-Pr6RDr_aquY_gO4K9YJN2U"> Now I turn to the husbands. We brothers certainly need the restrictions that come from our wives. I thank the Lord <span class="pg" data-page-id="273" id="273">[273]</span> for my dear wife. I can testify that the best help which she has given me has been her restrictions. She even restricts my eating. Although my stomach belongs to me, she determines how much I eat. Day after day I tell her, “I’m still hungry,” but she answers, “It is sufficient. There is no more.” Eventually, however, as a result of accepting her limitations, my stomach trouble was cured. I have learned that if you have stomach trouble or a stomach ulcer the best way to deal with it is to be restricted in your eating. Thus, any restriction is truly a great help. We all need restrictions. Therefore, God ordained suffering to man to restrict him, to rescue him by discipline, and to guard him. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="vGPkFtfe7Aen3iGIVhF4DcWjr4FFJoSKHjShQRi-Q6TFheMiOa11sXw6WrcmFYS61">2) Concerning the Woman</h2><h2 class="head6" data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3OhkvD2ZITDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12">a) Suffering in Childbearing</h2>
<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQIF_6fWVG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> Concerning the woman, God has ordained suffering or pain in childbearing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27573" data-verses="Genesis 3:16">Gen. 3:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27574" data-verses="1Timothy 2:15">1 Tim. 2:15</span>). The suffering in childbearing includes both pregnancy and delivery. The entire matter of childbearing, including pregnancy and delivery, is a matter of pain. It was not originally destined this way by God before the fall; however, due to the fall God ordained a portion of suffering for the woman, the leader in the fall. You may ask why God ordained suffering firstly to the woman and secondly to the man. God did this because the woman took the lead in transgressing God’s prohibition. Thus, God came to her first. That was fair. If God had gone to Adam, Adam would have said, “Lord, don’t come to me. I was not the leader in the fall. You must go to the leader.” Thus, God came to Eve first. </p>
<p data-content-id="uMdoZ7sIrphDxIxrKnqKnf-JCN9aZxYYQWIgd4x9rSnaU9KtTeicgVo8QagD4QHNt"> Why do some women limit their childbearing? Because they want to enjoy a free life. That is against God’s way. We all know that childbearing is troublesome, but it was ordained by God as a restriction. The best protection to an unrestricted young woman is to have a number of children. Although neither the woman’s parents, husband, nor in-laws can restrict her, as long as she has some children these children will limit her undue freedom. Children are a restriction and a protection to their mothers. Thus, Paul wanted the <span class="pg" data-page-id="274" id="274">[274]</span> young women to marry and bear children that they might not be idle or busybodies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27575" data-verses="1Timothy 5:13-14">1 Tim. 5:13-14</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnmWtkK6obQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM">b) The Ruling of the Husband</h2><p data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-ytt0_iAKBllPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo"> The Lord also told Eve that her husband shall rule over her. According to this word, every sister should be under the rule of her husband. Why did Eve fall? Because she did not care for her husband and assumed his headship. Therefore, God seemed to say to her, “Eve, from now on I appoint Adam to rule over you.” Although this is a difficult word to accept, the Bible tells us that a woman must be ruled by her husband. We all must take this word as a security and protection. The ruling of the husband is a genuine safeguard to the wife. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27576" data-verses="1Timothy 2:11-12">1 Timothy 2:11-12</span> Paul says, “Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection; but I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man.” Paul’s teaching on this matter is based upon God’s ordination in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27577" data-verses="Genesis 3:16">Genesis 3:16</span>. I hope that the sisters will take heed to this divine word of the Bible. </p>

<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6PaVabSH9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> Concerning the man, the ground grows thorns and thistles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27578" data-verses="Genesis 3:17-18">Gen. 3:17-18</span>). Many of you are not farmers and may think that you can escape from the ground. However, regardless of the kind of job or profession you may have, your job or profession is the ground. In the whole earth there is not one job or profession that is without hardship. In every occupation the ground grows thorns and thistles. Some may say then, “I will never be hired by others. I will go into business for myself.” If you say this, after a few years you will not want to be in business any longer. You will feel like giving up your business because, instead of producing dollars, it grows thorns and thistles. In every kind of employment—in the schools, factories, markets, and offices—it seems easy for the ground to grow thorns and thistles. Several years ago I met a brother who is a fruit farmer. I thought that it would be wonderful to be a farmer, but the brother told me many <span class="pg" data-page-id="275" id="275">[275]</span> stories about the difficulties with his farm. Such difficulties are ordained by God. Young people, you must realize that this is God’s ordination. God told Adam that the ground would grow thorns and thistles and that he had to suffer pain and toil. </p>

Apparently we are studying the fall; actually we are considering the glad tidings. If there had been no fall, there would have been no glad tidings. Praise the Lord for the fall!

<p data-content-id="BLE5KA_UJUWmNHemF8RznMCmepIh0O1klPDPPz_cM4ETPjCdTs_KDy-6YMjsxBV2U"> At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27646" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> man had already fallen (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27647" data-verses="Genesis 3:6-8">Gen. 3:6-8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27648" data-verses="Genesis 3:22-24">22-24</span>). Nevertheless, man had received God’s promise of salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27649" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">3:15</span>) and had obtained God’s way of salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27650" data-verses="Genesis 3:21">3:21</span>). When God promised Adam that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent, Adam believed and responded by calling his wife “Living.” Adam and Eve had been awaiting the sentence of death. Thus, when they heard the glad tidings, Adam did not call his wife “Dying,” but “Living.” As we pointed out in message nineteen, the whole human race is dying; no one is living. Nevertheless, after hearing and receiving the gospel of God, man becomes living. Hallelujah, we are living! </p>
<p data-content-id="x52sBK0RPP8CO8qDhR2srrvetl0q0DNKTmsXdJCAVgGjfw6s5s9H5KtPnduIvZkRU"> Although Adam’s response in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27651" data-verses="Genesis 3:20">Genesis 3:20</span> proves that he believed the gospel, we find no indication in that chapter that Eve also believed. However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27652" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4:1</span> tells us that Eve believed the glad tidings. “And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have acquired a <span class="pg" data-page-id="288" id="288">[288]</span> man, Jehovah” (Heb.). Eve brought forth a son and called him Cain, which means “acquired.” Although Cain, the person, was evil, his name was very meaningful. When Eve brought him forth, she declared, “I have acquired.” She had not acquired a house or some land; she had acquired a man. According to her concept, Cain was the seed of woman promised in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27653" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>. God had promised Eve that her seed would bruise the head of the serpent, the evil one. Eve’s words in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27654" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4:1</span> prove that she had believed that promise and that she was expecting to have that seed. When her first boy was born, she declared, “I have acquired a man, Jehovah.” If you think that this translation is too bold, I ask you to consult the Hebrew text. In the Hebrew text of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27655" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4:1</span> there is no preposition between the words “man” and “Jehovah.” Although some translators may add prepositions such as “from” or “with,” there is no such preposition in this part of the Word according to the Hebrew text. The Hebrew text simply reads, “I have acquired a man, Jehovah.” The Concordant Version of Genesis renders it this way in the text, and the New American Standard Version places this translation in the margin. Thus, according to Eve’s understanding, the child she bore in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27656" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">4:1</span> was the fulfillment of the promise regarding the seed of the woman in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27657" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">3:15</span>. Therefore, she called her child Jehovah, the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="E-xv1nlZl2LrnNkDtbmzOfI6duSStUIFb3C0mvDz1LtjokSWkphwKc-Ng-yoBiibt"> Such a statement, however, was premature. Eve actually did not bear the man, Jehovah. Four thousand years later the virgin Mary gave birth to a child, and His name was called the mighty God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27658" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isa. 9:6</span>). The child born in the manger at Bethlehem was Jehovah. His name was called Jesus, which means, “Jehovah, the Savior” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27659" data-verses="Matthew 1:21">Matt. 1:21</span>). Although Eve herself did not give birth to the man, Jehovah, she symbolized the virgin Mary who gave birth to Him. Eventually, the real seed of the woman came through the virgin Mary. Therefore, Jesus, Jehovah, the Savior, is truly the man, Jehovah to whom Eve supposed that she had given birth as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27660" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4:1</span>. By giving her child the name Cain, Eve proved that she believed the gospel proclaimed by God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27661" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>. Although four thousand years had to pass, the man, Jehovah eventually came through the virgin Mary. <span class="pg" data-page-id="289" id="289">[289]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2yCGOYwNY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df"> Both Adam and Eve believed the gospel. Adam believed and called his wife’s name “Living”; Eve believed and called her son “acquired,” thinking that she had acquired what God had promised. Adam and Eve certainly must have preached the gospel to their children, telling Cain and Abel how they had been created by God, how they had been charged by God not to eat of the tree of knowledge, how they had disobeyed God and had eaten of that tree, how they were in fear and trembling as they awaited the sentence of death, and how God came in to preach the gospel by promising them that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent. Furthermore, Adam and Eve must also have told them how they had stood naked in the presence of God and how God had slain some lambs as sacrifices, using the skins to make robes to cover their nakedness that they could stand before God and have fellowship with Him. I am convinced that Adam and Eve preached this gospel to their children. Evidence of this is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27662" data-verses="Hebrews 11:4">Hebrews 11:4</span>, which says, “By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.” According to the Bible, faith comes from hearing the word that is preached (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27663" data-verses="Romans 10:17">Rom. 10:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27664" data-verses="Romans 10:14">14</span>). Since Abel had such faith, exercised this faith, and offered a sacrifice to God in accordance with this faith, he must have heard the preaching of the glad tidings from his parents. Out of that word he received faith. He did not present his sacrifice according to his own opinion or learning, and his offering was not his own invention. He presented his offering by faith according to the words preached by his parents. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ss-Kv9Ptsxb3Hpm3OLvQWTga3WUZkwLJkPM-9Yo5gpNrugTwkZhE_qWQlLbkcq0fN"> The father, Adam, the mother, Eve, and the second child, Abel, believed the gospel. We, the saved ones, are not the firstborn. The firstborn perished (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27665" data-verses="Exodus 12:29">Exo. 12:29</span>), and the second born were saved by believing. We who believe are the second child. Praise the Lord that we are the second boys, the second children. Adam was a good father, taking the lead in believing the gospel. I hope that all the fathers reading this message will be leaders in believing the gospel. Eve, a good wife and mother, was also a believer, following her believing husband and opening the way for her child to believe. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27666" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> we have a believing father, a believing mother, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="290" id="290">[290]</span> a believing child. Look at this family—they all believed in the same gospel. When people have asked me if Adam and Eve were saved, I have said, “Why not? If you are saved, then certainly they were saved as well. In fact, they were saved much earlier than you were.” Adam and Eve were pioneers in believing the gospel. Adam cut the way, Eve paved the way, and Abel walked on the way. Now we are followers of Abel. I wish that every father would be an Adam, every mother an Eve, and all the children Abels. The first family on the earth was a gospel family, a family of believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUDsBBjBPjRtaf2PAgd0RIWeJne1KXdsQrQ3vEcVWKTvzkKR8PehPPTdnoCg5OrXo"> Abel himself was an extraordinary believer. Although you have read the Bible for years, perhaps you have never noticed Abel’s occupation. He was a “feeder of sheep” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27667" data-verses="Genesis 4:2">Gen. 4:2</span>, Heb.). During Abel’s time sheep were of no use for man’s eating, since, before the flood, man was only permitted to eat vegetables (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27668" data-verses="Genesis 1:29">Gen. 1:29</span>). Only after the flood did God ordain that man eat meat as well as herbs (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27669" data-verses="Genesis 9:3">Gen. 9:3</span>). Therefore, as Abel was feeding the sheep he was not working for food to live on. It seems that Cain was more clever; he was more practical than Abel and “was a server of the ground” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27670" data-verses="Genesis 4:2">Gen. 4:2</span>, Heb.). Cain might have said to his brother, “Abel, what you are doing is impractical. What is the use of raising sheep? Look at what I’m doing. I am serving the land because the land will produce food for my living. How can you earn a living simply by feeding sheep? All you can get is the skin to cover you, but you have nothing to live on.” If we enter into the thought of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27671" data-verses="Genesis 4:2">Genesis 4:2</span>, we shall see that Abel was not working for his living, but for God’s satisfaction. Abel did not care about his own satisfaction; he cared for God’s. Cain, on the contrary, did not care for God’s satisfaction; he only cared for earning a living for himself. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7WmLaelT93ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo">CAIN AND ABEL</h1><p data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKQhCYn20XCaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI"> In this message, a parenthesis in our study of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27689" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span>, we need to see more about Cain and Abel. During this life-study of Genesis we have pointed out several times that nearly every item found in the first three chapters of Genesis is a seed that is developed in the following books of the Bible, especially in the New Testament. This is also true in the case of Cain and Abel. According to the revelation of the divine Word, these two brothers should be considered as two important seeds sown in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27690" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span>. This is proved by the fact that the New Testament speaks of both Cain and Abel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27691" data-verses="Jude 1:11">Jude 11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27692" data-verses="1John 3:12">1 John 3:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27693" data-verses="Matthew 23:35">Matt. 23:35</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27694" data-verses="Hebrews 11:4">Heb. 11:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27695" data-verses="Hebrews 12:24">12:24</span>). The Lord Jesus was alluding to Cain in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27696" data-verses="John 8:44">John 8:44</span> when He said that the Devil “was a murderer from the beginning.” As we saw in the previous message, Cain became one with the Devil and, thus, both Cain and the Devil were the murderer of Abel. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27697" data-verses="John 8:44">John 8:44</span> the Lord Jesus also said that the Devil was a liar: “When he speaks a lie, he speaks out of his own self; for he is a liar and the father of it.” I believe that this also was an allusion to Cain, referring to the lie that he told God when He asked him about his brother (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27698" data-verses="Genesis 4:9">Gen. 4:9</span>). Cain lied to God in His presence. Thus, Cain was not only a murderer, but also a liar. Therefore, the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27699" data-verses="John 8:44">John 8:44</span> is evidence that the story of Cain in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27700" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> is a seed. </p>
<p data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnCH480WjEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB"> We have seen that in the beginning man was placed in front of two trees, the tree of life and the tree of knowledge (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27701" data-verses="Genesis 2:8-9">Gen. 2:8-9</span>). These two trees represent two sources out of which two lines continue throughout the whole Bible: the line of the tree of life and the line of the tree of knowledge. Undoubtedly, Cain was on the line of the tree of knowledge, and Abel was on the line of the tree of life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="302" id="302">[302]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="4ih-7ivO1f_Uex_xN1d2zI9hdIeVCD7MrPWGnia394uU8LdMUmJUsII4OLzctGMcQ"> Adam and Eve certainly must have produced more children than the two mentioned here. However, the Bible here only mentions Cain and Abel. Why does the Bible only mention these two here? Because the intention of the Holy Word is to show us the two categories of people which existed from the beginning of the second human generation: Cain, who represents the line of the tree of knowledge, and Abel, who represents the line of the tree of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="oojwSJGvLbmiYj5tIQGoqZQYH4r44PdhX0jmIOM9tm0WtyG5HMI5sjMdIyAZ1hq_3"> The Bible ends as it begins. It begins with two trees denoting two sources and it concludes with two cities—the great Babylon and the New Jerusalem—denoting two consummations. One of these cities is great and the other is holy. The great Babylon will be the ultimate consummation both of the line of the tree of knowledge and of the seed of Cain. The seed of Cain is sown in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27702" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span>, developed throughout the Old and New Testament, and will be consummated in the great Babylon revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27703" data-verses="Revelation 17:1-2">Revelation 17 and 18</span>. Likewise, the New Jerusalem will not only be the ultimate consummation of the line of the tree of life, but also of the seed of Abel. Everyone who will be a part of the New Jerusalem will be an Abel. Every piece of precious stone in that city will be an Abel for eternity. On the contrary, the majority of those in the great Babylon will be Cains. Hence, the great Babylon is the ultimate consummation of so many Cains, and the New Jerusalem is the totality of all the Abels. What are you—an Abel or a Cain? I hope that no one reading this message is a Cain. </p>
<p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQbp09rkF8HTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> Let us now consider these two brothers more thoroughly, examining them in the light of the subsequent books of the Bible. We begin with Cain. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYgwJUscU65oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa">I. CAIN</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-ytt0_qAKBFlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo">A. Working and Living for Himself—<br/>“a Server of the Ground”</h2>
<p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXQ0DVfocO443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> In the last message we pointed out that Cain was one who served the ground to make a living. He is called here “a server of the ground” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27704" data-verses="Genesis 4:2">v. 2</span>, Heb.). This means that he was working and living for himself. He not only worked and lived for <span class="pg" data-page-id="303" id="303">[303]</span> himself, but also by himself. Please remember that after the fall of man, man’s self became the incarnation of Satan. Thus, to live by man’s self actually means to live by Satan. Cain lived as such a person. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkw_heeNTuoPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU">B. Worshipping God<br/>according to His Own Concept<br/>Which Originated with Satan</h2><p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6PadabiP9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> What was wrong with Cain? Humanly speaking, he was not wrong originally. When I was a young Christian, I acted as Cain’s attorney, arguing on his behalf in the heavenly law court. I felt that there was nothing wrong with Cain. He was the first to present an offering to God. Abel was second. He might have learned this from Cain. It seemed to me that it was not wrong for Cain to present an offering to God; it was not like gambling, lying, or murdering. Thus, I argued with God, saying, “God, You were not fair with Cain. Your unfairness provoked him to kill his brother. If You had been fair, Cain probably would have loved his brother very much.” I spoke as an unlearned attorney, as a country boy in a law court. However, God was kind toward Cain, not executing His judgment upon him. God was also merciful to me, not putting me to death. Eventually, through the passing of years I came to understand the reason that God refused to accept or to look upon Cain and his offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjIdAH8T5cGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD"> Let me tell you the reason. Cain and Abel were born of fallen parents. Adam and Eve were not merely wrong with God, but had been injected with the evil nature of Satan. Satan’s nature had penetrated their nature, mind, and concept. Adam and Eve realized their condition, recognizing that they were wrong in the presence of God. In fact, they were also filled with the evil element of Satan. They realized that God was merciful and gracious to them, promising them salvation and providing them robes made of skins to cover their nakedness, which typified Christ as the genuine righteousness to come. As we pointed out in the last message, Adam and Eve told their children about this, declaring God’s way of salvation. Thus, Cain and Abel were not born of <span class="pg" data-page-id="304" id="304">[304]</span> pure parents; they were the descendants of polluted, corrupted, contaminated, and ruined parents. </p>
<p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qdmVIx_1dzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> Suppose we have one glass of pure water and another glass of polluted water. If you offer me the pure water, I would appreciate it very much, drinking it to assuage my thirst. However, if you offer me the glass of polluted water, I would be insulted. Although I may be thirsty, I would refuse the offer of a glass of polluted water. If you understand this example, you will not say that God was unfair in rejecting Cain’s offering. God simply cannot accept polluted water, that is, a polluted offering. Cain was born of polluted parents and, by birth, was unclean and contaminated. God, on the contrary, is holy, righteous, and pure. Not only were Cain and Abel corrupted and sinful, but within them was the enemy of God. Since Satan, God’s enemy, lived and acted in them, and motivated them to do things, everything they did out of themselves would have been an action of God’s enemy. If you were God and realized that within Cain was the Devil, your enemy, would you accept his act of worship? Such worship is an insult to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="aGZQhn44RfDLbiYsGGvVESokVru3KCGvuVmdAiPygWOGRgcCG0VL2WETay77K2O7o"> Apparently we do not see the Devil in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27705" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span>; we see Cain murdering and lying. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27706" data-verses="John 8:44">John 8:44</span> the Lord Jesus said that that was the Devil murdering and lying. In the eyes of God, it was not merely Cain, but the Devil. Moreover, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27707" data-verses="1John 3:12">1 John 3:12</span> we are told that Cain was “of the evil one.” The Greek word translated “of” actually means “out of.” Hence, Cain was out of the evil one, the Devil. Cain’s source was Satan. These two verses show us clearly and thoroughly that Cain and the Devil, the Devil and Cain, were one. </p>

<p data-content-id="gUDsBBjBPjRtaf2PAgd0RIWGJmaRKXdsQrQ3vEcVWKTvzkKR8PehPPTdnoCg5OrXo"> In this message we continue our study of the second fall of man. As we have seen in previous messages, in the first fall man ate something wrong. According to our human concept, this was not very serious. When I was a young Christian, I tried to argue with God, asking what was wrong with eating a piece of fruit. I met other Christians who held the same concept. However, if we proceed from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27743" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27744" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span>, we shall see the evil things that issued out of that small seed. </p>
<p data-content-id="e4Tu7RSEEn956Bu43KIdFsNBemwZLhbqE99G8qhMhliWdoAMPEcx2IgxrawDytCgr"> The seed that entered into man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27745" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> is called sin by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27746" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27747" data-verses="Romans 7:19-20">Romans 7:19-20</span> Paul says, “For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil I do not will, this I practice. But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me.” Although most Christians know that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27748" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> says that it is no longer I but Christ who lives in me, not very many pay attention to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27749" data-verses="Romans 7:20">Romans 7:20</span> which says that it is no longer I but sin that dwells in me. By <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27750" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> we can see that the Christ dwelling in us is a person. Christ, the very embodiment of God, dwells in us as a person. In the same principle, we can say that the sin which dwells in us must also be a living person. I have no doubt that sin is the embodiment of Satan. Christ is the embodiment of God dwelling in our spirit, and sin is the embodiment of Satan dwelling in our flesh. Satan, the evil one, has injected himself into our nature. This occurred in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27751" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>, but the issue of this injection appears in fallen man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27752" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_LVvaUPl0w3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj"> This evil seed first expressed itself in a religious way, in <span class="pg" data-page-id="318" id="318">[318]</span> the way of worshipping God. Can you imagine that the seed of Satan indwelling fallen man would cause him to worship God? Yet, as we have seen, this seed in Cain did cause him to worship God, not according to God’s way or according to God’s revelation, but according to his concept which was the concept of a fallen man. What is the concept of a fallen man? It is the expression of Satan in man. Never forget the incident recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27753" data-verses="Matthew 16:20-23">Matthew 16:20-23</span> in which Peter expressed his concern for the Lord. Peter did not realize that Satan was present in his concept, but the Lord recognized it and called Peter “Satan.” Thus, the concept of a fallen man is simply the expression of the indwelling Satan. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="NgrUOPst9ndCGqPDKS1sPGMi5BbxKLEkyN_8bfWBSPyO-5g1-dnym0-8I86wUsKBc">d. Man’s Lie and Arrogance</h2><p data-content-id="topU0NZPOs7b25ters3Gd5mNK0mthSqSpV5hz_XoXr_MU93J_kJdBBom0evJv9lGi"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27754" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> we see that the evil seed which had been injected into man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27755" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> firstly manifested itself in what was apparently a good thing—worshipping God. Nevertheless, this chapter shows a further development of the seed: firstly into jealousy, then into anger, hatred, murder, and lies. Cain not only murdered his brother, but also lied to God Himself. Imagine that such a person dared to lie to God! After Cain slew Abel, God came to him in a kind and merciful way. In a sense, God did not come to judge or to execute the sentence of death upon Cain. God inquired of Cain as to where his brother was. This question indicated that the door of repentance was still open. If I had been Cain, I would have said, “Lord, forgive me for killing my brother. I committed such a sinful deed.” Under the enlightenment of the gospel, I would have confessed and asked for forgiveness. But listen to Cain’s answer: “I know not: Am I my brother’s keeper?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27756" data-verses="Genesis 4:9">Gen. 4:9</span>). This answer was a big lie, the first lie in the history of the human race. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27757" data-verses="John 8:44">John 8:44</span> makes it evident that Cain was not the only one telling the lie, but that the Devil also lied from the beginning. Cain was one with the liar, the Devil. Satan, the Devil, was the liar, and Cain cooperated with him to speak a great lie. The first lie on earth was not spoken to man, but to God. Notice now the development of the seed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27758" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span>: it began with worshipping God and developed into lying to God. Moreover, Cain was arrogant. His <span class="pg" data-page-id="319" id="319">[319]</span> words, “Am I my brother’s keeper?” show his arrogance. Now we can see to what extent man had fallen. Every evil thing found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27759" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> came from the little seed that was injected into man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27760" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="h08U91ltZnqTUI0aV0g56nSyiI8qCw-cZTKHrVo12qTwS3OgmpjHqkUk9BKO83GId"> This evil seed remains in our nature. Apparently, you may be gentle, nice, kind, and good; actually, the evil seed of Satan abides in your nature. Thus, we must take the way of salvation revealed by God. The seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent, the evil one, who is the source of all evil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27761" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Gen. 3:15</span>). The seed of the woman, our Lord Jesus Christ, has bruised the head of the serpent objectively on the cross, and day by day He continues to bruise the serpent’s head subjectively within us. Under the covering of the Lord’s prevailing blood, I can testify that the indwelling seed of the woman has bruised the serpent’s head within me several times today. As long as we do not care for the seed of the woman within us, Satan will still manipulate us. We have no way of escape other than believing that Jesus is the seed of woman who is daily and hourly bruising the head of the evil one within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWIRvBEoatXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> There is no need for us to commit sinful acts in order to be sinful persons. As long as we are human beings, we are sinful. We are sinful by birth. In fact, we were sinful before we were born. Hence, we are a piece of sin. If you ask what I am naturally, I would reply that I am nothing but a piece of sin. I am defiled, polluted, and contaminated. I need the blood of God’s Lamb to cleanse me. I need Christ as the seed of the woman to crush the serpent within me. However, if I worship God according to my own concept instead of taking God’s way of salvation, I will immediately be under the control of the evil one. Although he may motivate me to worship God, he would, in so doing, take absolute hold of me. After causing me to worship God, he may develop in me to such an extent that I would become a liar and be arrogant in the presence of God. We all must see that the seed of every evil lies within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="MtCll2XOY8R8dFgTUXdR4a9c7Xob8JwNRjNJM9TIVoQfsRCA1WYTsZI35lh9oQ1PX"> When I was a young Christian, I said, “Since Satan was in Cain and Cain was so evil, why didn’t God just get rid of him? If I had been God, I would have sentenced him to death.” But <span class="pg" data-page-id="320" id="320">[320]</span> God was kind and merciful, leaving open the door of repentance to Cain and to all fallen people. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="Vyv6cezndY8yrw_ApV0zPek67F7SJbjcYWxSSt0SaXZR8SPfWLyu4As---ucS3eoN">4. The Result</h2><h2 class="head4" data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8AfonztgcHauNKoc1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq">a. The Greater Curse</h2>
<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6v2f5kN1WapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> As a result of man’s second fall, God pronounced a greater curse. “And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand; when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27762" data-verses="Genesis 4:11-12">4:11-12</span>). These words were a warning to Cain. God seemed to be saying, “Since you have done such evil things, the ground will be under a greater curse than it was before. It was cursed because of the fall of your parents and so it brought forth thorns and thistles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27763" data-verses="Genesis 3:17-18">3:17-18</span>). Now, because of your further fall, the ground will receive a further curse. It will be cursed to the extent that regardless how much you labor upon it, it will not yield to you its strength.” </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWjydy4trQfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK">b. The Vagabondism</h2><p data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXkUPpgNWAwrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip"> Moreover, God told Cain that “a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27764" data-verses="Genesis 4:12">4:12</span>). What is a vagabond? A vagabond, or a wanderer, is a person who has no goal, no home, no satisfaction, and no rest. A vagabond has no dwelling place and no comfort; he continually wanders on the earth, floating from place to place. God told Cain that he would become such a vagabond. </p>

<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6v2b5lJJWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> In this message we come to the last two verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27794" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span>. We have seen that nearly every item found in the first chapters of Genesis is a seed that is developed in the following books of the Bible. Although <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27795" data-verses="Genesis 4:25-26">Genesis 4:25-26</span> is such a brief portion of the Word, it contains a very significant seed. However, before we consider this seed, we need to cover some other matters. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWjyd24sfgfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK">5. The Way to Escape</h2><p data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXkUPtgMy0wrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip"> The first fall of man occurred in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27796" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>, and the second fall in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27797" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span>. We have seen that the way to escape from the first fall is to believe in the seed of the woman, that is, the Lord Jesus, and to take God’s way of salvation. Nevertheless, as a result of this fall, Satan is within our nature. This was the main cause of the second fall. What is the way of escape from this second fall? </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LmY06aCDKrZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0">a.

What does it mean to be presumptuous? It means to do good, to worship God, and to serve God according to our human concept and not according to God’s revelation. We have seen this illustrated in the case of Cain (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27798" data-verses="Genesis 4:3">4:3</span>). Doing anything of ourselves, regardless of how good it is according to our own concept, is presumptuous and is one with the Devil. As fallen man with Satan in our nature, we must reject anything that originates with ourselves. We <span class="pg" data-page-id="332" id="332">[332]</span> must do everything according to the way revealed by God that we may be kept from the Devil and from the furtherance of the fall. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIISfSGwDfD0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs">b.

On the negative side, we should not be presumptuous; on the positive side, we should live for God and worship Him according to His revelation and in His way. It is not only to live for God and to worship God, but to do so according to the way of God’s revelation. We must remain in God’s way that we may be kept from any further fall. </p>

Realizing the Vanity of Human Life</h2><p data-content-id="0JV8hDILxxkbeRl9MfljI4dvqx7hVL0iYCHdxKUekJ14F8oFrW_U5yl_qzhcrk_AB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27803" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> we find two names which are especially meaningful. The first one is Abel, which means “vanity.” As a result of the fall, the human life became a vanity. Look at people today. Although they are very busy, within them there is a gap, a void. Deep within them is a sense of emptiness. Regardless of your social status, regardless how wealthy or how successful you are, when you sit alone in the quiet of the night or early morning, you know there is a gap within you. That emptiness is the vanity that I am talking about. This is exactly what the wise King Solomon meant when he said, “Vanity of vanities, all under the sun are vanity” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27804" data-verses="Ecclesiastes 1:2-3">Eccl. 1:2-3</span>). In order to escape the second fall of man we must realize that as fallen men without God everything we are, have, and do is empty. We are nothing but vanity. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYQqM4VksdMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx">d. Realizing the Fragility of Man</h2><p data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZgQzrVFQp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6"> The second name which is especially meaningful is Enosh, which means “frail, mortal man.” After the fall, not only did human life become a vanity, but man also became frail and mortal. We must admit that we are frail, weak, and easily broken. How easily we fail! Man is mortal. No one can boast that he will live another week. No man knows his tomorrow. <span class="pg" data-page-id="333" id="333">[333]</span> To escape the second fall of man we need to realize both the vanity of human life and the fragility of man. If we have this realization, we will have no trust in ourselves and, thus, we will not be presumptuous in departing from the way of God. </p>

I must live for You and worship You in Your way. Lord, my life is vanity. I am frail and mortal.” When we see that our life is vanity and that we ourselves are frail, spontaneously we will call upon the name of the Lord. This is the reason that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27805" data-verses="Genesis 4:26">Genesis 4:26</span> says, “Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.” From the time of Enosh, the third generation of mankind, men began to call upon the name of the Lord, realizing their weakness, fragility, and mortality. </p>
<p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2MBKInSdiDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> In Hebrew, the word for “the Lord” is Jehovah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27806" data-verses="Genesis 4:26">4:26</span>; cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27807" data-verses="Exodus 3:14">Exo. 3:14</span>). The title “God” is primarily used for God’s relation to His creation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27808" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>. The name Jehovah is primarily used for God in relation to man starting from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27809" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>. Jehovah is the name for God coming into an intimate relationship with man. Hence, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27810" data-verses="Genesis 4:26">Genesis 4:26</span> does not say that men began to call on the name of God, but on the name of Jehovah. Men did not call on the One who created all things, but on the One who was so near to them, on the One who was closely related to them. The name Jehovah means “I am that I am,” that is, He is the One existing from eternity to eternity. He is the One who was in the past, who is in the present, and who will be in the future forever. He is the everlasting One. When men realized that they were fragile and mortal, they began to call on Jehovah, the everlasting One. This is the calling on the name of the Lord. This calling began even with the third human generation. </p>
<p data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQcCJHroTFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B"> When we are careless about God, we do not call on His name. However, when we realize that we must live for Him and worship Him in His way, and when we realize that we are <span class="pg" data-page-id="334" id="334">[334]</span> frail and mortal and that our life is nothing but vanity, spontaneously, from deep within us, we not only pray, but call upon the name of the Lord. Therefore, we must consider this <em>most</em> important seed of calling on the name of the Lord. It is a most significant matter in both the Old and New Testaments. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="QMSNPOcCBLw6v-EOydvwYF1hIvY7duX4YH5_O01lRUzkJdbjHu_x8PZ2HwO74uIjb">1) The Definition of Calling On the Lord</h2><p data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7WmLCelHR3ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo"> Firstly, we need to learn the meaning of calling on the name of the Lord. Some Christians think that calling on the Lord is the same as praying to Him. Formerly, I held the same concept. One day, however, the Lord showed me that calling on His name is different from merely praying. Yes, calling is a type of prayer, for it is a part of our prayer, but calling is not merely praying. The Hebrew word for call means to “call out to,” “to cry unto,” that is, to cry out. The Greek word for call means “to invoke a person,” “to call a person by name.” In other words, it is to call a person by naming him audibly. Although prayer may be silent, calling must be audible. </p>

Many readers of the Bible have found this chapter to be so dry that they have passed over it in their reading, perhaps, at most, paying attention only to the last twelve verses. Nevertheless, we must recognize that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27895" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span> is a most important portion of the Holy Word. Although many names and years are mentioned in this chapter, it is not an account of history. The whole Bible is a book of life, and this chapter, with all of its names and years, shows us the way of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD0XeB0DPfiWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP"> As we saw in the last message, at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27896" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> we have the wonderful matter of calling on the name of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27897" data-verses="Genesis 4:26">4:26</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27898" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span> speaks of walking with God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27899" data-verses="Genesis 5:22">v. 22</span>). To call on the Lord is one thing, and to walk with God is another. We all must call on the Lord and, following this, walk with God. We should not walk according to the age, but with God. Walking with God must follow our calling on the Lord. Thus, we must progress from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27900" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27901" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span>. Let us now consider the contents of this chapter. </p>

The Ultimate Issue of Man’s Fall<br/>and the Way to Escape It</h2><h2 class="head3" data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9BnrVhKkq6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr">1. The Genealogy of the Saved</h2>
<p data-content-id="FyrUURSenH7AUUlr0ndgcusYHkT-vlth22OadvBKOnc_QUvWSaFJlMIPAfMT2Bdu2"> Firstly, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27902" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span> tells us the origin of man. What was man’s origin? The answer is found in the first two verses of this chapter, which are very important and wonderful. “This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their <span class="pg" data-page-id="348" id="348">[348]</span> name Adam, in the day when they were created.” According to these verses, man’s origin was not only God, but also the likeness, the image, of God. God’s image was the practical origin of Adam, for Adam was made in the image of God. Thus, our origin is not a certain race or nationality; it is God with His image. All of us have been created by God in His image. It does not matter whether we are male or female because both male and female, both husband and wife, were called Adam. God has ordained this as a divine principle, and this principle still operates today. For example, Mr. and Mrs. Taylor both have the name Taylor. Mr. Taylor is husband Taylor, and Mrs. Taylor is wife Taylor. Thus, both the husband and the wife are Taylor. In like manner, both Adam and Eve were called Adam. Once God has established a principle, it remains. No one can alter it. </p>
<p data-content-id="CAIiqFyjjgw0LbNxWLi5D9YH-yyGcXq_WajUO0fMiI1qsIetqtq6bkTvknnO7bFYb"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27903" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span> is a wonderful chapter. I have never read a record like it in any other book. I have not read elsewhere that a man lived for a certain number of years and begat a son, that after this begetting he lived another period of time, begat children, and then died, and that his son lived for certain years and begat a child and continued to live and to beget children and then died. This is the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27904" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span>, a record which seems very repetitious. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27905" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span> is filled with names that are difficult to pronounce, with the number of years that the people lived, and with the words “lived,” “begat,” and “died.” These three words are repeated again and again throughout the chapter. Furthermore, have you ever noticed that the word “lived” is used twice for each person? For instance, we are told that Adam lived a hundred thirty years and begat Seth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27906" data-verses="Genesis 5:3">5:3</span>) and that all the days Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27907" data-verses="Genesis 5:5">5:5</span>). Following Adam, Seth lived a hundred five years and begat Enosh and then lived another eight hundred seven years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27908" data-verses="Genesis 5:6-7">5:6-7</span>). This cycle of lived, begat, lived, begat, and died is repeated eight times in this chapter. Although ten generations are mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27909" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span>, we must deduct Enoch who was an exceptional case and Noah whose death is not recorded in this chapter. Thus, we have eight generations that lived, begat, lived, begat, and died. <span class="pg" data-page-id="349" id="349">[349]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LmY02aAXirZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> There is a great difference between the records of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27910" data-verses="Genesis 4:1-2">Genesis 4 and 5</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27911" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> tells us that certain people lived, but it does not tell us how many years they lived. In a sense, the people named in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27912" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> had no living in the eyes of God. Their lives were vanity. However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27913" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> tells us of many of the things that they invented—religion, city planning, city building, farming, music, and weapons. That chapter also speaks of the evil things that the people did. How strange that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27914" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span> tells us nothing of the deeds and activities of the people. Those men lived for such a long time, in most cases for more than nine hundred years. What did they do? Although I have spent considerable time studying this chapter, all I could learn was that the people lived, begat, lived, begat, and died. Other than this, there is not the slightest hint revealed as to what they did. All they did was live and beget. </p>
<p data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtqIm8iLrv_u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m"> Man was not only created by God in the image of God, but also for God. Thus, God ordained that man should multiply. God’s eternal purpose can never be fulfilled without man’s multiplication. If you had asked Adam what he was doing, he probably would have answered, “Brother, I am living for God’s purpose. I am begetting for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. God doesn’t need my work, He needs my begetting.” What is begetting? Using a New Testament term, we may call it fruit-bearing. Begetting is fruit-bearing. Therefore, Adam was bearing fruit for God’s purpose. He was being very fruitful. I have already mentioned that the word “lived” is used twice for each person. Now I wish to point out that the word “begat” is used three times for each. For example, Adam lived a hundred thirty years and begat Seth; after he begat Seth, he lived another eight hundred years and begat sons and daughters. This indicates that the people in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27915" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span> were simply living and begetting. </p>
<p data-content-id="6CXs4WE0BL6-B1B4FDiAFrpUue3XzGKjTYJeRnGmeXBe72gXmUfpgBoC9qhDjO81n"> We are doing the same thing today. Do not say that you are teaching or working as a carpenter. You must say, “I am living in the presence of God and I am begetting, bearing fruit to fulfill God’s purpose.” As we have seen, the fulfillment of God’s purpose depends upon our begetting. The more sons we beget, the more useful we are in God’s hands. This was a <span class="pg" data-page-id="350" id="350">[350]</span> physical matter with Adam, but it is a spiritual matter with us. We are living and begetting. Fifty years ago I was a single person. Now I have a large family composed of many children and grandchildren. Nevertheless, I am not as happy with my physical family as I am with my family in the churches. Under this little ministry I have been living and begetting a large family composed of thousands of persons. If you were to ask me what I have been doing for the past forty-three years, I would answer that I have been doing nothing except living and begetting. </p>
<p data-content-id="R_GfdTPWaEiXNNW82-yDaXljDhuiLG6UWYb4K416h7Rart6vExDqqOyU38XwPBejO"> Our profession is unique—it is living and begetting. When we say this, the worldly people simply cannot understand what we are talking about. However, it is very real. The things mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27916" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> are vanity, but there is no vanity found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27917" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span>. If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27918" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span> along with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27919" data-verses="Luke 3:1">Luke 3</span>, you will see that the genealogy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27920" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span> eventually brought forth the Lord Jesus. This genealogy began with God and issued in Christ. The living and begetting brought forth Jesus. When <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27921" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27922" data-verses="Luke 3:1">Luke 3</span> are put together, we see that all the dear ones in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27923" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span> were not living in vanity. They were living and begetting in a most meaningful way to bring forth Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="sHB9QAVlSM3v0XjManno-mgkrmHHfHA5fTkqfQSTHo75EQs1z1Iu7LXCJgPqSPnNs"> The record of the genealogy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27924" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span> is wonderful as far as the people’s living and begetting are concerned. However, it contains a black spot, that is, after the people lived and begat, they died. For them to live and beget was wonderful, but for them to die was not a pleasant thing. If you compare this genealogy with the genealogy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27925" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span>, you will see that in the genealogy of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27926" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span> there is no death. Death remained in Adam’s genealogy because Christ had not yet come. Since Christ has come, in the genealogy of Christ death has gone. Christ “nullified death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27927" data-verses="2Timothy 1:10">2 Tim. 1:10</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQIFn6eSpG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> In this message we come to the third fall of man, which is recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27960" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">chapter six</span> of Genesis. If we study Genesis carefully, we shall realize that the intention of the Holy Spirit is to show man’s continuous degradation. Man fell step after step and level after level. The record in Genesis reveals that there were at least four steps to man’s fall. We may call these steps the four falls of man. In each fall man descended a step lower than the previous fall, falling lower and lower until he reached a point from which he could not fall any further. The third fall was not man’s lowest fall; it was a further step of man’s decline. As we shall see, after the third fall, there was a fourth. Man has fallen to a greater degree than we can imagine. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="uMdoZ7sIrphDxIxrKnqKnf-RCMJqZxYYQWIgd4x9rSnaU9KtTeicgVo8QagD4QHNt">1. The Cause</h2><p data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnmWt8K7MvQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM"> Firstly, again we need to consider the cause of man’s third fall. We can find a reason or cause for every fall. The cause of the third fall of man was not simple. Even in the first fall the cause was not simple, because that fall was not only brought about by man, but by a source other than man—the serpent, that is, the Devil, Satan, the enemy of God. We have seen that the enemy of God, who had entered into fallen man, became a subjective cause of the second fall. So, in every fall there was a cause other than man himself. Each fall, of course, was the fall of man, but the cause in each case was not merely man himself, but also the enemy of God. In the first fall, the enemy of God was outside of man. In the second fall, this enemy was inside of man. Now, in the case of the third fall, the enemy took another step, causing man to fall even further. We need <span class="pg" data-page-id="362" id="362">[362]</span> to discover what was this other step. It is much worse than we can imagine. Although you might have studied the book of Genesis several times, you probably have never noticed the secret mystery of Satan’s device. As we consider this satanic device, we need to look to the Lord for the covering of His prevailing blood, for this message touches the evil power and exposes the subtle device of God’s enemy. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-ytt0_6AIVtlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo">a. The Evil Spirits Mingled with Man—<br/>the Fallen Angels Joined with Man<br/>through Illegal Marriage</h2><p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXQ0DFfqYi443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> In the first fall, Satan seduced man to partake of something other than God. In the second fall, Satan, who was in man’s nature, distracted man from God’s way of salvation. In the third fall, Satan caused the evil spirits, that is, the fallen angels, to mingle with man and to join with man through illegal marriage. At the time of his fall, before the creation of this present world, Satan captured a large number of angels (see Life-study of Genesis, Message Two). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27961" data-verses="Revelation 12:4">Revelation 12:4</span>, it should be that one-third of the angels followed Satan in his rebellion. This is the reason that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27962" data-verses="Ephesians 6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span> speaks of the principalities and powers in the air. The Lord Jesus even told us that Satan has a kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27963" data-verses="Matthew 12:26">Matt. 12:26</span>). In this universe there is an evil kingdom of the subtle enemy of God, that is, the kingdom of Satan. Satan has a kingdom, meaning that he has under his rule a good number of principalities, dominions, and powers. </p>
<p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2MBCInS9iDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> According to the whole revelation of the holy Word, at the time of man’s third fall, these fallen angels under Satan’s control did something which polluted the human race. They caused the human race to be extraordinarily sinful and to be a mixture. No longer was the human race merely the human race; it became a race that was mixed with the fallen angels. Perhaps this word sounds very strange to you. Very few Christians know that the human race was once polluted by being mixed with fallen angels, the fallen spirits. Nevertheless, there is such a fact recorded in the Bible. At the time of the third fall of man, a number of the fallen angels in Satan’s principality came down to the earth, took human bodies, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="363" id="363">[363]</span> used these bodies to form illegal marriages with the daughters of men. In this way, the human race was mixed with the fallen spirits. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQcCBHrozFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B">1) The Sons of GodBeing the Fallen Angels</h2><p data-content-id="QMSNPOcCBLw6v-EOydvwYF1pIvozduX4YH5_O01lRUzkJdbjHu_x8PZ2HwO74uIjb"> This interpretation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27964" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">Genesis 6</span> is neither my invention nor my discovery. When I first studied <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27965" data-verses="Genesis 6:2">Genesis 6:2</span> fifty years ago, I was quite troubled. I had no difficulty with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27966" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">6:1</span>, but <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27967" data-verses="Genesis 6:2">verse 2</span> presented a problem. Who are the sons of God mentioned there? Then I learned that some of the Brethren teachers said that there were two lines in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27968" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span>—the line of the descendants of Seth, that is, the line of the godly people, and the line of the descendants of Cain. They said that the sons of God were the descendants of Seth. Since the descendants of Seth belonged to God, they were the sons of God. They also said that the daughters of men were the daughters of the descendants of Cain. I was not satisfied with that interpretation. It was not logical. How can you say that the sons of God were the descendants of Seth and that the daughters of men were the descendants of Cain? Were not the descendants of Seth also men? I could not accept their interpretation. Eventually I found the proper interpretation in Brother Watchman Nee’s writing. In his writings Brother Nee said that the sons of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27969" data-verses="Genesis 6:2">6:2</span> were angels. He pointed out that in the Old Testament we are told clearly that the angels are called the sons of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="27970" data-verses="Job 1:6">Job 1:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27971" data-verses="Job 2:1">2:1</span>). Although this was very logical, I found it difficult to believe. I wondered how angels could have married human beings. Brother Nee went on to say that the Syriac Version of the Old Testament renders “the sons of God” as “the angels” and that a few ancient manuscripts also use “angels” instead of “sons of God” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27972" data-verses="Genesis 6:2">Genesis 6:2</span>. Brother Nee then argued that we cannot say that only the daughters of Cain and not also the sons of Seth were the descendants of men. I was already in agreement with that point. Brother Nee went on to say that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27973" data-verses="Jude 1:6-7">Jude 6 and 7</span> there is a strong proof that the sons of God mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27974" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">Genesis 6</span> were fallen angels. Brother Nee undoubtedly had studied <em>Earth’s Earliest Ages,</em> by G. H. Pember. In that book Mr. Pember strongly proved <span class="pg" data-page-id="364" id="364">[364]</span> that the sons of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27975" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">Genesis 6</span> were fallen angels. Thus, after much study, I was fully convinced that the sons of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27976" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">Genesis 6</span> were fallen angels. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7WmLKel3Z3ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo">2) The Fallen Angels Committing Fornication<br/>with the Strange Persons</h2><p data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKQhCIn3gvCaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI"> The fallen angels committed fornication with strange persons, setting up an example which was followed by Sodom and Gomorrah. At this point we need to read carefully <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27977" data-verses="Jude 1:6-7">Jude 6 and 7</span>. “And angels who did not keep their own principality, but abandoned their own dwelling place, He has kept in eternal bonds under gloom for the judgment of the great day; as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, who in like manner with these gave themselves over to fornication and went after other flesh, are set forth as an example, undergoing the penalty of eternal fire.” When Peter and Jude wrote about the degradation, they wrote with the facts recorded in Genesis as a background. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27978" data-verses="Jude 1:6">verse 6</span>, Jude says that the angels did not keep their principality. Principality here means the angels’ domain or rule, referring to the sphere of their rule. What is the principality or sphere of the angels? According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27979" data-verses="Ephesians 2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27980" data-verses="Ephesians 6:12">6:12</span>, their principality is the air. God’s dwelling place is the third heaven, man’s dwelling place is the earth, and Satan’s and his angels’ dwelling place is the air. When <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27981" data-verses="Jude 1:6">Jude 6</span> says that the angels did not keep their principality, but left their own habitation, it means that they left the air, came down to the earth, and entered into illegal marriages with human beings. God has reserved these fallen angels under darkness in everlasting chains unto the judgment of the great day. </p>
<p data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnCHo81SfEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB"> When did these angels leave their principality? When did the fallen angels leave the air of their principality and descend to the earth and do something which caused God to reserve them in chains unto the judgment of the great day? They must have done something very serious in order for God to take such an action. When did this happen? It must have been during the time mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="27982" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">Genesis 6</span>. </p>

Although no one likes to hear the word “fall,” we need to realize that the falls portrayed in the book of Genesis are the background of a very positive picture which shows what God has done with the fallen human race. The main purpose of the record of Genesis is not to show the fall, but to show how much God’s grace can do for fallen people. The fall is a black background which helps us see a white picture. Without the black background, the white picture would not be so impressive. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28016" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> we saw man’s first fall and what God did for fallen mankind. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28017" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> we saw man’s second fall and something further which God did for the fallen people. In this message we shall see what God did as a result of man’s third fall. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIISfmGx33D0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs">5. The Way of Salvation from the Third Fall</h2><p data-content-id="yObOo7LOjjFarxWXeCIo4MwI-XenfP03Kiwq9oNdUXzgDgrb2yrYAyxlelIIkT9lp"> As we consider the third fall of man, we shall see more of what God has done for fallen people. After the first fall, Adam and Eve were saved. It is not a small thing to be saved. Although Adam and Eve were fallen, they nevertheless were saved. Adam said, “Living,” and Eve said, “I have acquired.” Adam and Eve were not saved by themselves, but by Christ who is the Lamb of God and the seed of woman. After seeing how God dealt with Adam and Eve, we saw that Abel offered sacrifice and gifts to God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28018" data-verses="Hebrews 11:4">Heb. 11:4</span>). Sacrifice was offered for his sins, and gifts were presented for God’s pleasure. Can a fallen man please God? Abel was a fallen man, but he pleased God. He was not only saved, he <span class="pg" data-page-id="374" id="374">[374]</span> also satisfied God. Abel did not please God by and with himself; he pleased God by and with Christ. We go from Adam to Abel and from Abel to Enosh. Enosh initiated the matter of calling on the name of the Lord to enjoy all His riches. With the case of Enosh, it was not just a matter of salvation or of pleasing God, but of calling on the Lord that man might enjoy all that He is. As we proceed from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28019" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28020" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">Genesis 5</span>, we find even more riches. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28021" data-verses="Genesis 5:1">chapter five</span> we learn that the saved ones lived, begat, and walked with God. After all of this, there is still more in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28022" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">chapter six</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28023" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">Genesis 6</span> we see that Noah certainly was saved, pleased God, called on the name of the Lord, and enjoyed all that He is. Noah also lived and begat, for he begat three sons. In addition to all of these positive aspects of the life of the saved ones, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28024" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">Genesis 6</span> shows us even more items. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="8UouUokiSDmfQ5btvmO_u9ilcySULW5y_xM7y0Cjh31lO6uhzd5IR1LXaUCBwG1Zr">a. Walking with God</h2><p data-content-id="0JV8hDILxxkbeRl9MfljI4dbqz_FVL0iYCHdxKUekJ14F8oFrW_U5yl_qzhcrk_AB"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28025" data-verses="Genesis 6:9">Genesis 6:9</span> tells us that Noah walked with God. Undoubtedly, Noah inherited all the spiritual blessings from his forefathers, such as Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, etc. and he followed his great grandfather, Enoch, to walk with God in a crooked, perverse, and adulterous generation. I do believe that he was much influenced by hearing of his great grandfather Enoch’s godly walk. Noah stood for a strong continuation of the line of life and, with much development, he carried it on further. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROmLzVTljeOlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX">1) Finding Grace in the Eyes of the Lord</h2><p data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9BnrthLAG6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28026" data-verses="Genesis 6:8">Genesis 6:8</span> says, “But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.” Finding grace in the eyes of the Lord is not a small thing. What does “finding grace” mean? Notice that this verse does not say that God was gracious to Noah, or that the Lord granted grace to Noah. No, it says that Noah found grace. Remember that Genesis is a book filled with spiritual seeds. Here, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28027" data-verses="Genesis 6:8">6:8</span>, we have the first mention of grace in the Bible. Noah was able to be what he was because he found grace in the eyes of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="FyrUURSenH7AUUlr0ndgcusgHmHevlth22OadvBKOnc_QUvWSaFJlMIPAfMT2Bdu2"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28028" data-verses="Hebrews 4:16">Hebrews 4:16</span> tells us to come boldly to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace in time of need. When <span class="pg" data-page-id="375" id="375">[375]</span> I was young, nearly every day in my prayers I would say, “Lord, I am coming to the throne of grace. At Your throne of grace I find grace for my timely need. Lord, I need Your grace every minute. I not only need Your grace every year, every week, every day, and every hour, but every minute. Without Your grace, I simply cannot bear anything.” Today I still need the Lord’s grace every minute. Perhaps in a few minutes my folks will give me a difficult time, or else one of the brothers will come to bother me. Perhaps I will receive a phone call from a sister. So, I keep on telling the Lord, “Lord, I need Your grace every minute. I know that You are gracious and that You have grace ready for me. Lord, since grace needs my cooperation, I kneel before the throne of grace to find grace to meet my need.” Many times we simply cannot stand our situation and we cannot face what is happening to us. However, there is a place called the throne of grace. Come boldly to the throne of grace that you may find mercy and grace for your time of need. </p>
<p data-content-id="CAIiqFyjjgw0LbNxWLi5D9Y_-w2icXq_WajUO0fMiI1qsIetqtq6bkTvknnO7bFYb"> Do you believe that, by himself, Noah was able to find grace in the eyes of the Lord? I do not believe that he did this by himself. The flood came 1,656 years after Adam was made. Adam lived for nine hundred thirty years. This leaves seven hundred twenty-six years from the year Adam died to the year the deluge came. When Adam was six hundred twenty-two years of age, Enoch was born and he lived as a contemporary of Adam for three hundred and eight years. After Adam died, Enoch still lived another fifty-seven years before he was taken by God. Sixty-nine years later Noah was born. So, Noah was born only one hundred twenty-six years after Adam’s death. When Enoch was sixty-five, he begat Methuselah and then lived for another three hundred years before he was taken away. Methuselah lived for nine hundred sixty-nine years, dying in Noah’s six hundredth year, the year the deluge came. Undoubtedly, Enoch learned the things of God from his forefathers, perhaps even learning directly from Adam. The fact that Enoch named his son “Methuselah,” which means “when he is dead, it shall be sent,” proves that he taught his son concerning God. Methuselah must have taught his son, Lamech, and Lamech his son, <span class="pg" data-page-id="376" id="376">[376]</span> Noah. Noah came from a godly family and learned from his forefathers all the godly things. Thus, he came to realize his need for grace. His generation was corrupt and filled with violence. The human race had become flesh. Noah lived in a crooked, perverse, and evil generation. Nevertheless, his parents and grandparents taught him the things of God, and he realized that he needed God’s grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KaZTBnRfDe1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> Now we can see why Noah found grace. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28029" data-verses="Genesis 6:3">Verse 3</span> of the same chapter indicates that God was prepared to give grace to fallen man, because His Spirit was striving with man, ready to give grace to the needy ones. However, this grace needed human cooperation. Noah gave the necessary cooperation and he found grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_Sw01Da1gjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> What is grace? Most Christians think that grace is merely something given by God. If I give you a Bible as a present, that is grace. Although this understanding is correct, in the Bible grace means much more than that. Grace is not only something given by God, but it is God Himself doing things for us. Grace is not merely something objective that is given to us by God. Grace is God Himself coming to us and doing things for us. Are you weak? God will come to be your strength, and that coming of God is grace. Are you unable to face your situation? That need not be a problem, because God will come to stand with you and face that situation for and in you. This is grace. If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28030" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">Genesis 6</span> carefully, you will see that grace here does not mean that God gave Noah many things. It means that God came to Noah and was with Noah. God’s presence was Noah’s strength and power. Noah not only enjoyed something given to him by God objectively, but he enjoyed God Himself. In the midst of a crooked, perverse, and adulterous generation, a generation whose temptations no one could withstand, Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. God came to strengthen Noah that He might stand with him and uphold him. That was the grace that Noah found, and that is the grace that we need today. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="x52sBK0RPP8CO8qDhR2srrvytnUq0DNKTmsXdJCAVgGjfw6s5s9H5KtPnduIvZkRU">THE LIFE AND WORK THAT CHANGED THE AGE</h1><p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2MB6ImGViDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> In this message, a parenthesis in our Life-study of Genesis, I am burdened that we see a crucial point regarding Noah’s life—that Noah’s life and work changed the age. Although I had seen this previously in my study of Genesis, I never saw it so impressively as in these days. It is not a small thing to change the age. </p>
<p data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQcC5HqsfFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B"> There is a great contrast between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28054" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28055" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">6</span>. If you read the latter part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28056" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, you will see that God created man in His own image for the purpose of expressing Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28057" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">1:26</span>). God intended that man be His expression. Man was made in the image of God to express nothing less than God Himself. Man was like a photograph, made in the image of God to express God. Furthermore, man was also committed with God’s authority that he might exercise this authority for God’s dominion on earth. We must see how great a commission this is. Man was created in God’s image that he might express God, and he was entrusted with God’s authority that he might represent God and set up a dominion on earth over all God’s creatures. God did not charge man to work or to establish a mission. No, God’s intention was that man should express Him with His image and represent Him with His authority. </p>
<p data-content-id="QMSNPOcCBLw6v-EOydvwYF1RIucTduX4YH5_O01lRUzkJdbjHu_x8PZ2HwO74uIjb"> After God created man and had a thorough look at him, He said, “Very good” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28058" data-verses="Genesis 1:31">1:31</span>). After His work on some of the six days, God simply said, “Good.” On the second day, God did not say anything, because on that day there were fallen angels in the air and demons in the water. It was impossible for God to say, “Good,” on that day. God did not say anything about the second day. On the sixth day, the day in which God created man, God looked at His work, especially on man, and said, “Very good!” In God’s eyes, man was very good. <span class="pg" data-page-id="388" id="388">[388]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7WmLyekT93ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo"> Five chapters later on, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28059" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">Genesis 6</span>, God took another look at mankind. When God had His first look at mankind in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28060" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, He was happy and pleased with man. When God had another look at man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28061" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">Genesis 6</span>, He saw that man had become wicked and corrupt to the uttermost, and it grieved Him that He had made man. What a change from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28062" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>! Originally, man was on such a high level, but, beginning at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28063" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">chapter three</span>, he descended lower and lower. What would you have done if you had been God? Perhaps you would have said, “Forget about it.” But what about God’s eternal purpose? Is not God the eternal God? Can the eternal God change? God is not a temporary God, but an eternal God. In Him there is no shadow of change (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28064" data-verses="James 1:17">James 1:17</span>). Once He makes a decision, it stands for eternity. If God had forgotten His eternal purpose, His enemy would have laughed at Him, saying, “You intended to create man to defeat me, but instead of You defeating me, I have defeated You.” Will God be defeated? Never! Then what should God do? The answer, the same in principle throughout the centuries, is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28065" data-verses="Genesis 6:8">Genesis 6:8</span>: “But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.” </p>
<p data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKQhCwn10XCaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI"> Let us read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28066" data-verses="Genesis 6:5-8">verses 5 through 8</span>. “And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.” In Hebrew, the words “every imagination” signify not only the imagination, but also the purposes and desires. “And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.” If that had been all, there would have been no hope. But hallelujah for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28067" data-verses="Genesis 6:8">verse 8</span>! This verse begins with a big “But.” “But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.” This is one of the greatest verses in the book of Genesis. Satan was glad to hear that God was going to destroy man from the face of the earth, but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. That turned the situation and changed the age. Hallelujah, God was not defeated! In the midst of apparent defeat, there was victory through a man who found grace in the eyes of the Lord. That was the turning <span class="pg" data-page-id="389" id="389">[389]</span> point. If you read history along with the Bible, you will see that in every generation, when Satan has done his best to damage the situation to the uttermost, there has always been one man or a few people who found grace in the eyes of God and who became the ones who turned the age. Remember the history of Israel. Although they degraded lower and lower until they reached the bottom, there was, much to the surprise of the enemy, a young man named Daniel. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28068" data-verses="Daniel 1:8">Daniel 1:8</span> says, “But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank.” There in the book of Daniel it says, “But Daniel”; here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28069" data-verses="Genesis 6:8">Genesis 6:8</span> it says, “But Noah.” At the bottom of man’s fall, there is always a “but.” </p>
<p data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnCHQ83WjEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB"> If we look at Noah’s life, we shall see that it was not simply a matter of walking with God or of building the ark. The basic and crucial point is that God used Noah to change the age. The enemy had driven the situation to the bottom, and even God repented that He had made man. There seemed to be no hope. But Noah found grace. Noah’s life was a life that changed the age. </p>
<p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQbp0VrmRUHTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> Look at the situation today. If you read the Gospels and if you see God’s purpose for the church, you will realize that the church has such a high commission. The church was produced with God’s life to express Him in this New Testament age. The church has been entrusted with such a glorious commission. There is no need for us to look into the past. The present situation is sufficient to show us how much the church has fallen and deviated from God’s proper goal. But do not be disappointed. Though Satan has done his best, God still has a way to carry out His original purpose. Among all the defeats, God today has raised up local churches to change the age. </p>

THE LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0ZLzxYoSconn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF"> Let us now look into the life that changed the age. What kind of life was it? I have such a heavy burden about this. I fear and tremble that I may fail God in His revelation. I am not trying to give you a good sermon. I want to discharge my burden upon you, passing on the burden that the Lord has <span class="pg" data-page-id="390" id="390">[390]</span> given me. How we need to see the kind of life that God can use to change the age! </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="YWQf39oOaKT-w18LKhlsjpNkn8kIDjHh52RJBmzJk0PH2LSkAzFUEZelzC01-ioTH">A. Inheriting the Godly Ways of the Fathers</h2><p data-content-id="E-xv1nlZl2LrnNkDtbmzOfIWduSCtUIFb3C0mvDz1LtjokSWkphwKc-Ng-yoBiibt"> This life always inherits the godly ways of the forefathers. Thank God that Noah, the tenth generation from Adam, had many good forefathers. Enoch was the seventh generation, Methuselah the eighth, Lamech the ninth, and Noah the tenth. All of Noah’s nine forefathers from Adam to Lamech were godly men. Although Genesis gives us a record of man’s fall, that is only a background showing us the true picture of the godly ways. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2yCqOYwdY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df">1. Adam’s Way of Salvation</h2><p data-content-id="Ss-Kv9Ptsxb3Hpm3OLvQWTg23WUJkwLJkPM-9Yo5gpNrugTwkZhE_qWQlLbkcq0fN"> Noah inherited Adam’s way of salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28070" data-verses="Genesis 3:20-21">3:20-21</span>). In Adam, we see the way of salvation. Although Adam had fallen, he was given the way of God’s salvation. If you had never fallen, you would never be able to taste the sweetness of God’s salvation. Since we have been fallen and saved, we can testify of the sweet taste of God’s salvation. Let us come with joy to draw water out of the wells of God’s salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28071" data-verses="Isaiah 12:3">Isa. 12:3</span>). Adam was the pioneer in drawing water out of the wells of God’s salvation. He was so joyful that he called his wife’s name “Living” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28072" data-verses="Genesis 3:20">3:20</span>—“Eve” means “living”). Do you not think that he was joyful when he called her “Living”? I am quite sure that he joyfully drew water out of the wells of salvation. I have no doubt that Noah inherited this way of salvation. </p>

<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="YWQf39oOaKT-w18LKhlsjpdAn9gsDjHh52RJBmzJk0PH2LSkAzFUEZelzC01-ioTH">C. The Ark</h2><p data-content-id="E-xv1nlZl2LrnNkDtbmzOfYydvm6tUIFb3C0mvDz1LtjokSWkphwKc-Ng-yoBiibt"> In this message we come to the ark (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28084" data-verses="Genesis 6:14-16">Gen. 6:14-16</span>). We have seen that Genesis is a book containing many spiritual seeds. The ark is truly a great seed. The Lord has shown us something about the depth of this great type. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2ySOOZUhY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df">1. The Size</h2><p data-content-id="Ss-Kv9Ptsxb3Hpm3OLvQWTwS3UA5kwLJkPM-9Yo5gpNrugTwkZhE_qWQlLbkcq0fN"> Firstly, I would like to speak about the dimensions and size of the ark. The length of the ark was three hundred cubits, the breadth fifty cubits, and the height thirty cubits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28085" data-verses="Genesis 6:15">6:15</span>). The ark had three stories (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28086" data-verses="Genesis 6:16">6:16</span>). Since the height of the ark was thirty cubits, each story must have been ten cubits high. These dimensions are very meaningful. Why was the ark not eight hundred cubits long, seventy cubits wide, and twenty or forty cubits high? Why was it three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high? The answer is that the basic numbers in God’s building are three and five. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUDsBBjBPjRtaf2PAgd0RIGWJlaRKXdsQrQ3vEcVWKTvzkKR8PehPPTdnoCg5OrXo"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28087" data-verses="Exodus 25:10">Exodus 25:10</span> tells of another ark, the ark of God’s testimony. Thus, in the Bible there are two arks—Noah’s ark and the ark of God’s testimony. The first ark bore two numbers, three and five. But the dimensions of the ark of the testimony are two and a half cubits in length, one and a half cubits in width, and one and a half cubits in height. As we compare these two arks, we see that two and a half is half of five and one and a half is half of three. The first ark has the numbers in full, and the second ark has the numbers in halves. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="400" id="400">[400]</span> Bible is the divine Word, and every point in it has a specific significance. Why are the measurements of the ark of the testimony in halves? When you see the half, you realize that there is another half, and that the two put together form a testimony. The two halves form a complete unit. That is God’s testimony. The second ark was God’s testimony. How could the testimony be signified by means of a figure? Although it is difficult for people to see a figure and realize the testimony, when people looked at the measurements of the ark of testimony and saw that they were halves, they would immediately realize the need of the other half. They would know that this was a testimony, for two is the number of testimony. What are the measurements of the ark a testimony of? They are a testimony of a complete unit in the basic numbers of three and five. </p>
<p data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3Ohk_H2ZIDDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12"> What is the meaning of the numbers three and five? In the Bible the number three firstly signifies the Triune God—God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28088" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matt. 28:19</span>). Why must God be in three Persons? Do we have one God or three? We must say emphatically that we have one God. However, some Christians, understanding the Trinity according to their mental apprehension, have come to believe in three gods. A man once told me that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three gods. When I heard this, I said, “Please do not say this. That is really heresy. The Bible never tells us that there are three gods. The Bible always says that there is one God.” Our God is one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28089" data-verses="Deuteronomy 6:4">Deut. 6:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28090" data-verses="Isaiah 45:5">Isa. 45:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28091" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:4">1 Cor. 8:4</span>). Why or how can this one God have three Persons? The term “Person” is not found in the Bible; it comes from man’s interpretation. Griffith Thomas, the writer of the best exposition on Romans, said in his book, <em>Principles of Theology,</em> “The term Person is also sometimes objected to. It certainly must not be pressed too far, or it will lead to Tritheism...While we are compelled to use terms like ‘substance’ and ‘Person,’ we are not to think of them as identical with what we understand as human substance and personality...The truth of the experience of the Trinity is not dependent upon theological terminology.” Griffith Thomas also said that our human language is inadequate to explain this divine mystery. We lack the language, the utterance, and the terms. We are short of the proper <span class="pg" data-page-id="401" id="401">[401]</span> understanding of this divine mystery. What terms should we use? We do not know. No adequate terms are available. The Trinity is a mystery, and we have no vehicle, no means, to express it. When Philip asked the Lord Jesus to show him and the other disciples the Father, the Lord said, “Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. How is it that you say, Show us the Father?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28092" data-verses="John 14:9">John 14:9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQIV76fWFG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> I have been condemned for saying that the Lord Jesus is the Spirit. Although I do not like to argue or to answer, I would like to ask those dear brothers who condemn me how they interpret <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28093" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Corinthians 3:17</span>, which says, “And the Lord is the Spirit.” Do not ask, “Then are the Lord and the Spirit one?” We do not have the skill nor the means to explain this adequately. Although we cannot explain it adequately, we do have a verse in the Bible which says, “And the Lord is the Spirit.” Where do you put this verse? Will you cut it out of your Bible? I would also present to those brothers <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28094" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span> which says, “Unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...The everlasting Father....” Is He the Son or the Father? Again, although we cannot explain this adequately, we do have this verse that says that the Son shall be called the Father. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28095" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">Second Corinthians 3:17</span> says that the Lord is now the Spirit, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28096" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span> says that the Son is called the Father. This is the mystery of the Trinity. We do have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; yet the Son is called the Father, and the Son is the Spirit. They three are still one God. </p>
<p data-content-id="uMdoZ7sIrphDxIxrKnqKnfuNCN9KZxYYQWIgd4x9rSnaU9KtTeicgVo8QagD4QHNt"> We all know <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28097" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.” It is quite clear that the Word and God are distinct. However, the following clause of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28098" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> says, “and the Word was God.” This clause creates a problem. In the beginning was the Word of God, the Word was with God, and the Word was God. Are they one or two? This is a mystery, the mystery of the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnmW9gK6oLQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28099" data-verses="Ephesians 4:6">Ephesians 4:6</span> says that the Father is in us, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28100" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">Colossians 1:27</span> says that Christ, the Son, is in us, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28101" data-verses="John 14:17">John 14:17</span> says that the Holy Spirit is in us. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are all in us. Once I presented these verses to a certain person, asking him if he was clear about them and if <span class="pg" data-page-id="402" id="402">[402]</span> he believed what they said. I asked him, “Do you believe all these facts—that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in you?” When he said that he did, I asked him, “Tell me, how many are in you now?” He said, “One.” Then I said, “Haven’t you admitted that the Bible tells us that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit all are in you? How can you say that only one is in you?” He could not answer. The Bible does say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, all three are in us. But, according to our experience, we have only one in us, whom we call either the Spirit or the Lord. This is the mystery of the Trinity of our God. He is the only one God, yet He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-ytt0vmAKBVlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo"> The Trinity of God is for Him to be dispensed into us. No food can get into us without being cooked or processed. If a food is not cooked, at least it must pass through the process of being masticated, swallowed, digested, and assimilated. Without this process, nothing can get into us. The Triune God is the very God who is dispensing Himself into our being. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28102" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> says, “Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” For what purpose do we baptize people into the Father, Son, and Spirit? For the purpose of processing them into God and for processing God into them. The Triune God, the Trinity, is not a theory or a theological teaching. It is God’s dispensation. </p>

<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWIB7BFs2tXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> God’s salvation to Noah was not only to save him from God’s judgment, but also from his crooked, perverse, and evil generation. In order to be saved from that evil age, he needed to be saved through water. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28132" data-verses="1Peter 3:20">First Peter 3:20</span> says clearly that Noah was saved through water. What does it mean to be saved through water? In order to understand this, we must know the background of Noah’s generation. </p>
<p data-content-id="MtCll2XOY8R8dFgTUXdR4atI7Wc78JwNRjNJM9TIVoQfsRCA1WYTsZI35lh9oQ1PX"> Noah lived in a crooked and perverse age. As a result of man’s first fall, the evil nature of Satan had been injected into man. In the second fall, man deviated from the presence of God into human culture. The evil nature of Satan which had been injected into man in the first fall developed into a godless human culture in the second fall. In the third fall of man, this culture ushered in an evil generation, producing a crooked, corrupted, and perverse generation. That generation was condemned in the eyes of God. It was into such a generation that Noah was born. Not only did God’s condemnation rest upon that age, but there was on earth the evil power of darkness. At the time of man’s third fall, that evil power of darkness had corrupted the earth and filled it with violence. As a result, God intervened to judge that generation and to terminate that age. Whoever lived on earth during that age was under two things: God’s judgment and the evil power of darkness. </p>
<p data-content-id="Vyv6cezndY8yrw_ApV0zPe0u7Ef2JbjcYWxSSt0SaXZR8SPfWLyu4As---ucS3eoN"> We live in the same kind of age. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28133" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">Matthew 24</span> and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28134" data-verses="Luke 17:1">Luke 17</span> the Lord Jesus likened our age to that of Noah. Noah’s background was exactly the same as ours; it was a prefigure of our background. Look at the world situation today. Undoubtedly, it is under God’s condemnation. It is also under <span class="pg" data-page-id="412" id="412">[412]</span> an evil power, a wicked influence. No young person or adult can withstand the evil power or influence of modern society. Christian parents pray for their children even before the children are born. They consecrate the children to the Lord, trying with fear and trembling to help them to know God and to stay away from the influence of this dark world. However, at the age of six, the children must attend school, and once they are in school, they are subject to the evil influence of the darkness of this age. Nearly all of the children are influenced at least to some extent. No one is immune. We can see that there is such an evil power, a wicked influence of darkness, on this earth. Everyone is under God’s judgment and under the power and darkness of the evil one. So, God’s full salvation not only saves us from His condemnation, but also from the evil power and influence of this dark age. On the day of Pentecost, Peter exhorted people, “Be saved from this crooked generation!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28135" data-verses="Acts 2:40">Acts 2:40</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8AfonztgcXOuPeQc1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq"> I say once again that nearly everything in the book of Genesis is a seed that requires further development. To be saved through water is a matter of baptism. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28136" data-verses="1Peter 3:20-21">First Peter 3:20-21</span> reveals that the water through which Noah passed was a figure of baptism. It may be considered as the first mention of baptism in the Bible. Thus, it was the seed of baptism. This seed of baptism was firstly developed in the case of the children of Israel passing through the Red Sea. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28137" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:1-2">First Corinthians 10:1-2</span> tells us that their passing through the Red Sea was a baptism. The passing through the waters of the Red Sea was a clear type of the baptism with water. Later, when the New Testament age came, the first thing that transpired to open up this age was baptism with water. God sent John the Baptist to carry this out. He came with the purpose of baptizing people with water. </p>
<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6vmL5mJJWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> Let us now consider the case of the Israelites. Although they were God’s chosen people, they fell and drifted into Egypt. The whole Egyptian nation was under God’s judgment. Since the Israelites also were there, undoubtedly they were under His judgment as well. They were at the same time under the power of Pharaoh and the Egyptians. Their exodus from Egypt was not an escape from God’s judgment; it <span class="pg" data-page-id="413" id="413">[413]</span> was an escape from Egypt, a deliverance from the Egyptian slavery. </p>
<p data-content-id="e4Tu7RSEEn956Bu43KIdFsdVenExLhbqE99G8qhMhliWdoAMPEcx2IgxrawDytCgr"> Let us see the salvation the children of Israel enjoyed. Firstly, they enjoyed the redemption of the blood of the lamb. They slew lambs and struck the blood upon the doorposts. In this way the Israelites were covered by the redeeming blood and saved from God’s judgment. When God executed His judgment over the land of Egypt, those who were under the blood were saved. The children of Israel were saved by the blood from God’s judgment. Following this, they all ate the flesh of the lamb. The purpose of doing this was not to save them from judgment, but to strengthen them to walk out of Egypt. When they ate the lamb, they put on their sandals, held their staffs, and were ready to go out. While they were eating, they were preparing to get out of Egypt. </p>
<p data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_LV_OUOBYw3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj"> What delivered the Israelites out of Egypt and out from under the power of Pharaoh? Although God saved them from His judgment, Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, would not let them go. Pharaoh was a type of Satan. Pharaoh, that is, Satan, seemed to say, “You children of Israel have been saved from God’s judgment and you have eaten the flesh of the lamb. You are ready to leave. Do you think that it’s easy for you to get out? This is my territory. This is my power, my kingdom, and my empire. I have the power here and I will not let you go.” Thus, Pharaoh sent his army to hold the Israelites back. But God came in to deliver them, not by sending angels or fire to burn Pharaoh and his forces, but by opening the Red Sea that they might walk through it. After His people had passed through the sea, the Egyptian army followed. While they were pursuing God’s people and when they came to the heart of the sea, God told Moses to stretch out his hand over the sea that the waters might come upon the Egyptians (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28138" data-verses="Exodus 14:26">Exo. 14:26</span>). Moses did this, and the sea obeyed him. Pharaoh’s army and all the power of the Egyptians were buried. The children of Israel were delivered. What were they delivered from? Not from God’s judgment, but from the power of Egypt and Pharaoh, that is, from the power of the world and Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="NgrUOPst9ndCGqPDKS1sPGc25DPRKLEkyN_8bfWBSPyO-5g1-dnym0-8I86wUsKBc"> The children of Israel enjoyed a double salvation. The first <span class="pg" data-page-id="414" id="414">[414]</span> aspect of their salvation was the redeeming blood, and the second aspect was the judging water. Hallelujah for the redeeming blood and the judging water! We know what the redeeming blood is, but I doubt that very many know what the judging water is. For us, the judging water is the cross of Christ. The death of the Lord Jesus on the cross is the judging water. A line in Hymn 438 in our hymnal says, “I’ve crossed the Red Sea of His death.” The Lord’s death was the judging water. Satan and the world were judged on the cross. When the Lord Jesus was about to go to the cross, He declared, “Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28139" data-verses="John 12:31">John 12:31</span>). Both Satan and the world were judged on the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="topU0NZPOs7b25ters3Gd52ZK2iJhSqSpV5hz_XoXr_MU93J_kJdBBom0evJv9lGi"> The Lord saved His people from the world by His judgment upon it. God executed His judgment upon the Egyptians, and that judgment was a salvation to the Israelites. To Satan and to his world, the cross was a judgment, but to us, this judgment on the cross is a salvation. It is not a salvation from God’s condemnation, but from the power of Satan and from the evil influence of this dark age. Since this matter is clear, we may return to Noah’s case. </p>

He was also under the evil power of the age in which he lived. Noah built an ark which was pitched within and without with pitch. The pitch was a type of the redeeming blood.

<p data-content-id="R_GfdTPWaEiXNNW82-yDaX1zDgqGLG6UWYb4K416h7Rart6vExDqqOyU38XwPBejO"> In the last message we saw that Noah and the people with him in the ark passed through the flood waters. As we have seen, passing through the water was a type of the baptism in the New Testament. After the flood, the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28169" data-verses="Genesis 8:4">Gen. 8:4</span>). That also was a sign, a type, a shadow of the resurrection of Christ. According to the Bible, the ark was a type of Christ. The ark passing through water signifies Christ passing through the death waters under God’s judgment. When the ark rested upon the mountains, it signified that Christ was resurrected out of the death waters. </p>

Life in Resurrection</h2><p data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XQ7ZHdoPkw1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW"> The Bible is marvelous. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28170" data-verses="Genesis 8:4">Genesis 8:4</span> says that the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat on the seventeenth day of the seventh month. If you read the Bible carefully along with history and the best lexicons, you will find that, at the time of the Passover in Egypt, the seventh month was changed to the first (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28171" data-verses="Exodus 12:2">Exo. 12:2</span>). The Jews have two kinds of calendars, the civil calendar and the sacred calendar. The civil calendar was the old one, and the sacred calendar was the new one, which began from the first Passover. When God told the Israelites to have the Passover, He told them that that month had to be counted as the first month of the year. In Hebrew the name of that month was Abib (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28172" data-verses="Exodus 13:4">Exo. 13:4</span>), which means sprouting, budding, fresh ears of corn. This signifies that, in the eyes of God, the Passover was counted as a new beginning of life. Why do I point this out? Because the Lord Jesus was crucified on the day of the Passover, on the fourteenth day of the month (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28173" data-verses="Exodus 12:6">Exo. 12:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28174" data-verses="John 18:28">John 18:28</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="424" id="424">[424]</span> According to the sacred calendar, He was crucified in the first month, and according to the civil calendar, He was crucified in the seventh month, the same month as when the ark rested upon the mount. The Lord was crucified on the fourteenth day of that month and was resurrected three days later. Thus, according to the sacred calendar, Christ was resurrected on the seventeenth day of the first month. According to the civil calendar, it was on the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the very day that the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat. So, in that early type of the ark resting upon the mountain, we were told the exact date of the resurrection of Christ. This is wonderful. </p>
<p data-content-id="LD01-v3um3NuLShGttlViqGanUvsRg9jsTHcyuTXlEDKbBHncuqREEkOSwGaFv9xn"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28175" data-verses="1Peter 3:20-21">1 Peter 3:20-21</span>, Peter connected the resurrection of Christ to the ark. He said that “eight souls, were brought safely through by water: which figure also now saves you, baptism...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.” The figure of baptism also saves us through resurrection. I say once again that the ark resting upon the mountaintop signified Christ’s resurrection out from the death waters. The month and day of both were exactly the same. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD0XOR0APfiWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP">1. A Shadow of the Church</h2><h2 class="head4" data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjINEH8TpcGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD">a. Resurrected with Christ</h2>
<p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qd2RIx_ldzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> What do we find after the resurrection? We see a new living. Noah and the seven other people had a new living. I would also like to call your attention to the fact that the number of people in the ark was eight. The number eight means resurrection. A week has seven days, and the beginning of a new week is the eighth day. Christ was resurrected on the first day of the week, that is, on the eighth day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28176" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20:1</span>). So, the number eight signifies resurrection. In this new living, the people were in resurrection. Whatever they did was in resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="aGZQhn44RfDLbiYsGGvVES4gVrunKCGvuVmdAiPygWOGRgcCG0VL2WETay77K2O7o"> Not many Christians realize the true significance of the type in this portion of the Word. We should understand this portion of the Word in the way of typology. All Christians agree that the ark was a type of Christ, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28177" data-verses="1Peter 3:20-21">1 Peter 3:20-21</span> tells us clearly that the passing through the flood was a <span class="pg" data-page-id="425" id="425">[425]</span> prefigure of baptism. Based upon these two facts, we must realize that everything related to Noah and to the seven people that were with him after the flood must also be a part of the complete type, forming a full picture of the type. We should not stop with saying that the passing through the flood was a type of baptism and that the ark resting on the mountain was a type of Christ’s resurrection. What about the life of the eight persons after the flood? In other words, what about the living of the people after the resurrection? What does the living of those eight people after the flood signify? It signifies the church life. The living of the resurrected people after the resurrection was the church life. This is absolutely logical. The eight persons in the ark signify us, the New Testament believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="bdPZiOYGTI0GDMWc0r7m5RfsNGe9CY4FzwTm0_1hM378LkILri-YBA6MHtvxUHmDQ"> I would like to say a word to the young people. When I was a young Christian, I exercised my mentality very much about the statements in the Bible that say that we are in Christ. I tried to figure out how we could be in Christ. I could neither see the reality of this nor understand its significance. One day, as I was considering what Noah’s ark passed through, the Lord showed me that the eight persons in the ark were a picture showing us how it is that we are in Christ. Those eight persons were in the ark when the ark passed through the flood. Thus, they also passed through the flood in the ark, but they themselves did not touch the flood. It was the ark that withstood the flood waters. This answers the questions of how Christ’s crucifixion can be ours and how we were crucified in Christ. When the ark came out of the flood, the eight people in it also came out. When the ark rested upon the mountaintop, the eight persons also were resurrected and rested on the mountaintop in the ark. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28178" data-verses="Ephesians 2:6">Ephesians 2:6</span> says that we were raised up together with Christ. Before we were born, we were resurrected. When Christ was resurrected out from the death waters, we were in Him. Therefore, in the church we are resurrected people. </p>
<p data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIISPOGwDPD0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs"> If we look at the picture of the type, we shall see that the church is another community; it is not the old society. The old community and society have been buried. When we were baptized, we buried the old community and society. The flood <span class="pg" data-page-id="426" id="426">[426]</span> came and buried Noah’s old society, and only eight persons were resurrected. Now the living of those eight persons on the new line must be a type of the church life. We are the church people, and the church people are a resurrected people. We are another community, another society. The church life is a new community. </p>
<p data-content-id="yObOo7LOjjFarxWXeCIo4Mgg-W6bfP03Kiwq9oNdUXzgDgrb2yrYAyxlelIIkT9lp"> After the flood, the eight persons saved through the ark began to have a new living. Before the flood, they saw many evil and ungodly things. But they were saved, separated, resurrected, and ushered into a new living. That new living was a type of the church life. In addition to all the other seeds sown in the book of Genesis, the seed of the church life is also sown there. Every part of the living of the eight people was a prefigure of a part of the church life. </p>

He sent forth a raven and a dove (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28179" data-verses="Genesis 8:7-12">8:7-12</span>). The raven represents the fleshly people. If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28180" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">Leviticus 11</span> carefully, you will find that the raven is an unclean bird. All of the unclean birds are unclean because they eat the dead things, the carcasses. In other words, they eat death. They are unclean because they feed on death. Death is filthy in the eyes of God. According to the Old Testament, once a person contacted death, he immediately became unclean. While the unclean birds ate death, the clean birds ate grain, cereal. In every grain there is life. The clean birds are clean because they feed on life. In the eyes of God, nothing is as clean as life, and nothing is as unclean as death. Do you eat death or life? Do you eat the carcass or the seed? Whoever eats carcasses is a raven, and whoever eats seeds is a dove. </p>

<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="prNfLWZ9JdrW7yTc3YS3U__T_rVmoK-lAf5XbjI5e4-Pr6RDr_aquY_gO4K9YJN2U">g.

<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3Ohk_L2bcrDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12">1) Because of the Success of His Work</h2><p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQIV36dSpG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> Why did Noah have a failure? Because he had been very successful. According to the record of Genesis, Noah had become the leader on the new land and the father of all mankind on the earth. At that time, he, as the father and leader of all mankind, undoubtedly was under God’s blessing. Noah began to be a farmer and planted a vineyard (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28216" data-verses="Genesis 9:20">9:20</span>). We know he was successful in this because the vineyards produced grapes from which wine was made (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28217" data-verses="Genesis 9:21">9:21</span>). Then Noah became somewhat loose. The grape wine was nourishing, and Noah drank it in excess. He was wrong in this looseness. He should have exercised self-control, but he did not, and became drunken. Being drunken, he was not only loose, but was careless, becoming naked without realizing it. He was unconsciously naked, and his son, Ham, saw this. This shows us that we all must be careful whenever we experience success under God’s blessing, for that success can easily cause us to be loose and careless. We should not be overly joyful with our success. Instead, we should be joyful in our suffering. When <span class="pg" data-page-id="440" id="440">[440]</span> we suffer, we must rejoice (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28218" data-verses="Romans 5:3">Rom. 5:3</span>). But when we are successful, we must be careful. Any kind of success can cause you to be loose in the presence of God. After being loose, you may become careless. Then you may lose your consciousness and even become naked. What does it mean to be naked? It means to lose your covering in the eyes of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8AfonztgcXGuNK4c1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq"> Here I must speak a strong word. As fallen human beings, we need a covering. We need a covering not only spiritually, but also physically. Spiritually and physically we must be covered in the presence of God. Before the fall of man, man was naked before God. There was nothing wrong with that nakedness because there was no sin. After the fall, because sin has come in, it is sinful to be naked. We are sinful in our nature and need a proper covering in the presence of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6vmD5kNlWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> Physically speaking, the proper covering is our clothing. Immediately after the fall, Adam and Eve discovered that they were naked and tried their best to cover themselves (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28219" data-verses="Genesis 3:7">3:7</span>), but they did not do it very well. Then God came in and covered them with the skins of the sacrifice (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28220" data-verses="Genesis 3:21">3:21</span>). That covering was also a type of Christ as the covering for fallen people. Physically speaking, fallen man needs a covering, especially before God. The priests were not allowed to be naked; they had to be fully covered when they came into the presence of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28221" data-verses="Exodus 20:25-26">Exo. 20:25-26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28222" data-verses="Exodus 28:40-43">28:40-43</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWjyNu4trAfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> People today like to be naked, exposing their bodies as much as possible. There is no need to ask what the Bible says about this—just ask yourself. Do you not feel that it is shameful to be naked? Your nature tells you that it is. The situation today is pitiful. People not only go against the Bible, but also against their own nature and consciousness. Both males and females must cover their bodies. Due to this deep conviction, I try to cover myself as much as possible. I do not like to have my body exposed. The more we are covered, the more we hide ourselves under a covering, the more peace we have. When I was young, I saw some people who wore short pants in the summer. If I were to wear short pants when I stand up to minister, I would not be able to speak. Even if I were to stand on the platform with bare feet or wear a short-sleeved shirt, I would find it difficult to speak. The more we expose our <span class="pg" data-page-id="441" id="441">[441]</span> physical body, the less peace we have. If you read the Bible, you will find that this conviction regarding nakedness comes from the fall. Regardless of how holy we are, we still need a covering. Our physical body must be covered. If I could have my whole body covered, including my head and my hands, I could speak much better, because I would have the assurance that no one would see me. I could speak in a covered way. We all must cover ourselves as much as possible. </p>
<p data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXkUf1gNWQwrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip"> We need a spiritual covering even more than a physical covering. What is our spiritual covering? It is Christ. In typology, all garments and clothing are types of Christ as our covering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28223" data-verses="Luke 15:22">Luke 15:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28224" data-verses="Psalms 45:13">Psa. 45:13</span>). To be naked spiritually speaking means to lose your covering in the presence of God, that is, to lose Christ as your covering. In fellowship, many times the brothers become overly excited about some success that they have had. When, in that excited talking, they become loose and careless, they lose Christ as their covering. They talk in the presence of God without any covering. I have seen this among the sisters. Some dear sisters prayed very spiritually with a full covering in the church meeting, but when the time came for them to fellowship with one another about certain exciting things, they became loose and careless. They lost Christ as their covering. In a sense, they were drunken and naked. Whenever I saw this situation among the sisters, I did not dare to enter in. From my learning in the past, I have come to realize that it is not good to see the nakedness of any saint. When the sisters engage in that kind of excited, naked fellowship, it is not good for me to see what is there. I like to see a wonderful prayer meeting, a meeting that is so high, with the prayers strong, and all the brothers and sisters fully under the covering of Christ. It is a blessing to see such a meeting. But, when I see a negative situation, I run away, for I do not like to see what is exposed there. We all must be careful not to be excited to the degree that we become loose, careless, drunken, naked, and lose the proper covering. Many times we were like this even while talking about spiritual things or about the church life. Perhaps we were even talking about a high church meeting, but we talked about it in a naked way without the covering of Christ. As fallen <span class="pg" data-page-id="442" id="442">[442]</span> human beings, we must keep ourselves covered by Christ in every kind of activity, in everything that we do or say. I would not do anything without Christ covering me. I would not talk to my wife, my children, or to my brothers or sisters without being covered by Christ. If I do anything without the covering of Christ, it means that I am loose, careless, drunken, and naked. It means that I have lost my self-control. That was exactly what happened to Noah. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LmYkiaAXyrZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> Young people must learn how to be fully covered in their attitude, talk, and even in their fellowship. This is a real lesson. Whatever you lack now will be fully exposed when you are older. We older ones must realize that our present lack exposes the lack of learning when we were young. It is just the same as in education. If you do not learn sufficiently when you are young, you will feel that you lack certain knowledge when you become old. It is good to be saved as early as possible. The young people must be encouraged to learn the lessons now. Otherwise, when they are older, their shortage then will expose the lack of learning today. Now is the time to learn some of the lessons of the fine details concerning the spiritual life. </p>

In those messages we saw how the ark made by Noah passed through the water and ushered Noah and his family into a new age. According to typology, at that time Noah and his family were living in resurrection, and that kind of living was a shadow of the church life. This shadow of the church life in resurrection reveals how the church people are resurrected with Christ, how they worship God with Christ, and how they resume God’s original purpose of expressing God and representing Him. Furthermore, this shadow shows how the church people live under God’s covenant. We may call them the covenanted people. Whatever they do is under God’s covenant and is full of blessing. We have also seen that, unfortunately, in that shadow of the church life there was a failure, for, in a sense, Noah, God’s deputy authority, failed God. Due to that failure certain things were exposed. Some received a blessing and others received a curse. </p>

Issuing in the Denominations Signified by the Nations</h2><p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qd2JIwbJdzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> In this message we must consider an aspect of the church life that is not pleasant. There is a glorious side to church history and there is also a shameful side, an unpleasant side. We need to look at this unpleasant side. </p>
<p data-content-id="aGZQhn44RfDLbiYsGGvVES44Vp6HKCGvuVmdAiPygWOGRgcCG0VL2WETay77K2O7o"> After the flood, Noah and his family had a new beginning. There was a real unity among them. They were one in everything. Firstly, they were one with God. As people in <span class="pg" data-page-id="452" id="452">[452]</span> resurrection (in typology the number eight denotes resurrection) these eight people were one with God. They worshipped one God. Secondly, they had only one goal: to express God and represent Him. Their goal was to return to the purpose that God had at the beginning. At the beginning, God purposed that man would express Him with His image and represent Him with His dominion. After the flood, the new race returned to God’s original purpose, expressing God and representing Him. Thirdly, these eight people were one in their opinion, language, concept, and understanding. They all spoke the same thing. They were all truly one. </p>
<p data-content-id="bdPZiOYGTI0GDMWc0r7m5Rf0NEaZCY4FzwTm0_1hM378LkILri-YBA6MHtvxUHmDQ"> As the days went by, more and more people were produced. The population increased tremendously. The result was division. They were not only divided into families and generations, but also into nations. A nation is a kingdom, an empire in which someone exercises authority as the so-called head. Whenever someone exercises authority over others, that is an empire, a nation. At the beginning of the new age of life in resurrection, there was only one deputy head, Noah, who represented God, the true Head. There was one family with one head. That was a complete unity. Eventually, however, the descendants of Noah were not only divided into families, but also into nations. That was terrible. </p>
<p data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYQqc8VksNMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx"> As we have pointed out several times in previous messages, Genesis, an all-inclusive book, is a book of seeds. Nearly everything that is revealed in the entire Bible is sown in this book as a seed. The seeds sown in the book of Genesis develop in the remaining books of the Bible, becoming a harvest in the book of Revelation. This is also true of the seed of division. The seed of division is sown in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28240" data-verses="Genesis 10:1">Genesis 10</span>, grows in the New Testament Epistles, and becomes a harvest in the book of Revelation. Now we must take some time to consider this seed of division among God’s people. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZgA3rVFAp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6">1) One Originally</h2><p data-content-id="BLE5KA_UJUWmNHemF8RznMS-ercB0O1klPDPPz_cM4ETPjCdTs_KDy-6YMjsxBV2U"> Originally God’s people were one. Why were they one? Although they were one because the family element held them together, the main factor of their oneness was their one God. Noah and his family worshipped one God. This one God <span class="pg" data-page-id="453" id="453">[453]</span> is the main factor that keeps God’s people in unity. Noah’s family was one because they worshipped the one, unique God. The worship of God is crucial. When the worship of God is changed, the whole situation among God’s people is also changed. When there are different worships among God’s people, there are divisions among them. Thus, the main factor that preserved the oneness of the new race was that they had no God other than the one, true God. Likewise, we have only one God. We worship the unique God. Our God is uniquely one. Therefore, we also are one. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28241" data-verses="Ephesians 4:6">Ephesians 4:6</span> speaks of one God and Father. Because we have only one God and Father, we are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="x52sBK0RPP8CO8qDhR2srr_GtnwO0DNKTmsXdJCAVgGjfw6s5s9H5KtPnduIvZkRU"> Furthermore, as I have already mentioned, Noah and his family were one because they shared one, unique goal. Neither Noah nor his sons were for their own interests. They were all for God’s goal. What was God’s goal? God’s goal was that man should express Him and represent Him. Noah and his family had no other God and no other goal. Their goal was not farming, education, or industry. Their goal was not their own self-interests. Their unique goal was to express God and represent Him. We must be deeply impressed with this. Although we have one God, we may have different goals. If we have different goals, we shall be divided. What is your goal? Is it to make a name for yourself or to be famous? Is it to build up something other than God’s purpose? We are here in Anaheim to express God and represent Him. We have a strong standing to declare to the whole universe, even to Satan and to all the rebellious angels, principalities, powers, and demons, that we, the local churches, are standing one with God for His purpose. Our unique goal is to express our God. We are here to express Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2MROInStiDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> I would like to say a simple word to some of the new ones who have been visiting our meetings. Do you realize what we are expressing here? Our people are not that intelligent or well-dressed. The leading ones have no beauty, form, or attraction. We have no grand piano or pipe organ. We do not even have a sign. What are we? We are nothing. We are just a voice in the wilderness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28242" data-verses="John 1:23">John 1:23</span>). When you come to our meetings, you can see nothing outwardly. But in all <span class="pg" data-page-id="454" id="454">[454]</span> probability you do see something—God Himself expressed. Perhaps after attending a meeting you wonder within yourself, “My, it was very good there with them, but I can’t pin down exactly in what way they are good. Their singing is not that musical. No one is dressed in an attractive way. There is no outward beauty or form. But, there is something there among them.” This “something” is the expression of God. God is our expression. He is our form, beauty, and attraction. As the church, we have returned to God’s original purpose, to the purpose He had in the beginning—that man express Him and represent Him. This is the Lord’s recovery. </p>
<p data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQcSNHrojFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B"> As the church, we do represent God. This is why many times we pray, “Lord, we give You the command. You must do something. We are here representing You, not ourselves. Since we are Your representation, You must do something for Yourself.” Can you pray such a prayer? Do you dare to pray in this way? Unless you stand in the position of representing God, your conscience will not allow you to utter such a prayer. But once you stand in the position of representing God, your conscience will confirm and strengthen you to say, “Lord, we give You the command. You must vindicate Your way. This is Your recovery, Your purpose. You must intervene. Since we are not here representing anything else but You, Lord, You must come in.” This is the proper church life. As long as we are such, we have the unique unity. We are uniquely one. There is no need for us to say, “Brother, let us be one.” If we need to say this, it is already too late to be one. As long as we go back to the beginning, to God’s original purpose that man express Him and represent Him, we are spontaneously one. We are one because we have one goal. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="QMSNPOcCBLw6v-EOydvwYFllIvojduX4YH5_O01lRUzkJdbjHu_x8PZ2HwO74uIjb">2) Divided Eventually</h2><p data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7WmbGel3J3ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo"> Why, then, were the people divided? They were divided because they began to have different worships and because they had different goals, interests, and purposes. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28243" data-verses="Genesis 10:31">Genesis 10:31</span> reveals four ways in which the people were divided: according to their families; according to their languages, that is, according to their different words, concepts, understandings, and utterances; according to their different lands; and <span class="pg" data-page-id="455" id="455">[455]</span> according to their different nations.

All Bible teachers agree that in this verse, a verse which indicates that God has given man authority over other men, we can see here the beginning of human government. Before that time, God had never given man authority over others. All men were directly under God. But, due to the fall, there is a rebellious nature in mankind. For this reason, God established a certain authority on earth to be His deputy to rule over man. From the beginning of the book of Genesis until the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28258" data-verses="Genesis 9:6">9:6</span>, there was no indication that, apart from the husband being the head over his wife (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28259" data-verses="Genesis 3:16">3:16</span>), God had given man authority <span class="pg" data-page-id="468" id="468">[468]</span> over others. However, after the flood, when in resurrection man lived on the earth in a new way, God established a deputy authority on earth. </p>

As the head of a new race, he was the deputy authority under God. Adam was not God’s deputy authority over man. He was appointed to have authority over the creatures, not over man. If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28260" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> carefully, you will see that Adam had authority over the fish, the fowl, the cattle, the creeping things, and “over every living thing that moveth upon the earth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28261" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">vv. 26</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28262" data-verses="Genesis 1:28">28</span>). But there is not one word to indicate that Adam was given authority over other men. But after Noah became the head of a new race, God gave him authority not only over creatures other than man, but also over man. </p>

Why was the earth filled with violence? Because there was no deputy authority, no one who was authorized to rule over others. There was no deputy authority over man before the flood. Suppose that today there were no local, state, or federal government. Would we still be able to live peacefully? No, the land would be filled with violence. No one could sleep well at night, for all would fear that their possessions would be stolen. Because there was no government before the flood, the earth was filled with violence. As we shall see in the next <span class="pg" data-page-id="469" id="469">[469]</span> message, the government during that time was man’s conscience. In the garden, before the fall, man was directly under the rule of God, the divine government. After the fall, man was under the rule of his own conscience. However, the government of the conscience, or we may say self-government, did not work well. The result of this self-government was that the whole earth was filled with violence. Thus, after the flood, God authorized man to rule over other men and human government began. </p>

These verses in Micah, which refer to the coming kingdom, tell us that men shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks because there will no longer be war, and that every man shall sit under his own vine and fig tree. This means that there is peace. That Noah planted a vineyard proves that he was enjoying peace in the kingdom. At that time there was no violence. The proper church life today is a real vineyard where there is no fighting but rest. </p>

It is the same with the type in the book of Genesis. How good it was that Noah enjoyed peace in the kingdom and that mankind was recovered back to the beginning to fulfill God’s purpose.

<p data-content-id="oojwSJGvLbmiYj5tIQGoqZAMH4L44PdhX0jmIOM9tm0WtyG5HMI5sjMdIyAZ1hq_3"> In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28313" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">chapter eleven</span> of Genesis. According to the divine record in the book of Genesis, mankind has had four falls. The first fall was that of Adam in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28314" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">chapter three</span>, the second was that of Cain in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28315" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">chapter four</span>, and the third was that of the crooked and perverse generation before the deluge recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28316" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">chapter six</span>. Now, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28317" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">chapter eleven</span>, we see man’s fourth fall (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28318" data-verses="Genesis 11:1-9">vv. 1-9</span>). These four falls continued one after another. Here in the fourth fall the subtlety of the enemy is exposed. This fall occurred after the flood. It transpired on the new earth after the restoration of human life under the headship of Noah. As we have seen, that life was a type of the life in resurrection. Man’s fourth fall had such a background. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQbpkprnl8HTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd">1. The Cause</h2><p data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYgwZAsf065oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa"> Behind each of the four falls there was one common unique source—Satan, the enemy of God. You may ask, “Is not God the Almighty One? Since He is the Almighty One, why did He not destroy this enemy? It would have been so easy for Him to do it.” But even God’s enemy is at least somewhat useful in God’s economy. Although God’s economy has so many positive things in white, it needs some negative things in black to show the whiteness of the white. One of the black, negative things is Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0ZLjNYqG8onn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF"> Many philosophers have written books about the condition of man on earth. All of their writings are nonsense; not one of them has hit the mark. However, when we come to the Bible, we find that it is filled with facts and with the divine <span class="pg" data-page-id="482" id="482">[482]</span> revelation. Not one word is wasted. For example, the first two chapters of Genesis reveal God’s purpose and the relationship between God and man. In the next eight and a half chapters, from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28319" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> to the middle of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28320" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">Genesis 11</span>, we find the record of man’s four falls. In the fourth fall man fell to the uttermost. No fall can go beyond this. This means that in the fourth fall of man, the enemy of God, Satan, has done his worst. He can do nothing more. He did everything within his limit that he could possibly do, using every available means to bring about man’s fourth fall. </p>

The Instigation of Satan</h2><p data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKQhSMn3g_CaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI"> Satan instigated a rebellion against God in the heart of man. Thus, the fourth fall was altogether a rebellion. Although there was a small element of rebellion in the first fall, that fall was not a rebellion; it was mostly a fall. But man’s last fall was truly a rebellion instigated by Satan. The fourth fall, along with the three preceding falls, had the two factors of Satan and man. In this fall Satan was the real cause because he instigated a rebellion within man against God. In a sense, he created a rebellion in the heart of man. In all the falls of man, man fell from at least three levels, and now we need to consider each of them. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnCXs81SPEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB">1) Man’s Fall from God’s Presence to Man’s Conscience</h2><p data-content-id="4ih-7ivO1f_Uex_xN1d2zIt1dJq1CD7MrPWGnia394uU8LdMUmJUsII4OLzctGMcQ"> The first level was that man fell from God’s presence to man’s conscience. This means that man fell from the divine government to self-government. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28321" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, after God created man, He put him in front of Himself. Man was in God’s presence, and there was nothing between God and man. There was no separation, hindrance, or frustration. Man was directly in the presence of God. In a very good and positive sense, man was directly governed by God’s presence. </p>
<p data-content-id="oojwSJGvLbmiYj5tIQGoqZAMH5Pc4PdhX0jmIOM9tm0WtyG5HMI5sjMdIyAZ1hq_3"> As we saw in message ten, God created man in three parts, with a spirit, a soul, and a body. The spirit was directly related to God’s presence, the soul was under the direction of the human spirit, and the body was under the control of the soul. Originally, man’s spirit was under God’s presence, his <span class="pg" data-page-id="483" id="483">[483]</span> soul was under his spirit, and his body was under his soul. That was the situation at the beginning. At the beginning, God’s presence was the controlling essence. We may call this the divine government. Before the fall, the created, unfallen man was directly under this divine government. At that time man was not even controlled by something out of God. He was controlled directly by the presence of God. How wonderful that was! I like to be controlled by someone’s presence. If the brothers simply leave me a word telling me to do certain things, I would feel quite bad. I do not like to be controlled by their word; I want to be under the direction of their presence. In married life, for example, the wives are often controlled by their husbands’ presence. This is very sweet. I have observed this quite often when I have been invited to have dinner with a family. The husband did not have to say anything to the wife. As the wife looked into her husband’s eyes, she knew exactly what to do next. Just a glance at the husband’s face was sufficient to tell her that it was time to serve tea. How good it is to be governed and directed by the presence of our dear ones. </p>
<p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQbpkprmREHTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> At the beginning, man was under God’s presence from which man fell firstly to man’s own conscience. This matter of the conscience has been a problem to most students of the Bible, because no one has been able to determine whether or not God created a conscience for man at the time of man’s creation. There is no record concerning this. As a result, many Bible students have thought that man had no conscience before man’s first fall. But we have to believe that, from the very beginning, there was within man an element created by God which eventually turned out to be man’s conscience. The element of the conscience was within man from the time of his creation, but the function of the conscience was not developed until the time of the fall, until the time when Adam and Eve partook of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and their eyes were opened. Immediately, when their eyes were opened, the element of their conscience began to function. God is sovereign. He has foresight. In His creation of man, God made provision for the conscience. The element of the conscience was present in man, but its <span class="pg" data-page-id="484" id="484">[484]</span> function was not in use until man had been seduced by Satan and had fallen. At the time of that fall, the conscience began to function. </p>
<p data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYgwZAseQG5oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa"> Consider the example of a burglar alarm. Although an alarm has been installed in a building, it does not function unless there is a burglary. If there is no burglary, the alarm does not function. But when there is a burglary, the alarm goes off immediately. This illustrates the element of conscience in man. It was installed in man at the time of his creation. It was built into the human building when God created man. But the conscience, which had been installed in man, had to wait for the time to function. That time was the time of man’s first fall. When that fall transpired, the conscience began to function immediately, and Adam and Eve realized that they were naked (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28322" data-verses="Genesis 3:7">3:7</span>). They felt ashamed. That was the beginning of the function of man’s conscience. </p>
<p data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0ZLjNYoSMonn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF"> It is a good thing that human beings are able to feel shameful. If I stole a certain thing and then was able to boast about it, that would be terrible. If I steal something, I should feel ashamed of it. But so many young people today have no feeling of shame. They are not ashamed of their evil doings. But shamefulness is a protection for fallen man; it is a part of the function of our conscience. If we have a genuine, good, clean conscience, it will always cause us to be ashamed whenever we do something unclean or immoral. This is an excellent protection. </p>

Genesis, a book of fifty chapters, is divided into three sections. The first section (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28352" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">1:1—2:25</span>) covers God’s creation, the second (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28353" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">3:1—11:9</span>) covers the serpent’s corruption of mankind, and the third covers Jehovah’s calling. Each of these sections begins with a special phrase. The first section begins with the words, “In the beginning God.” The second section begins with the phrase, “Now the serpent.” The third section begins with the words, “Now Jehovah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28354" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">12:1</span>, Heb.). In these three sections we see three titles—God, the serpent, and Jehovah. These titles mean a great deal to us. After God created, the serpent crept in to corrupt, and then Jehovah came in to call. So the book of Genesis mainly relates these three major things. </p>
<p data-content-id="topU0NZPOs7b25ters3Gd52BK3GthSqSpV5hz_XoXr_MU93J_kJdBBom0evJv9lGi"> According to the revelation of the Bible, Elohim, the Hebrew word for God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28355" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">1:1</span>, is a title that mainly relates to God’s creation. The title of Jehovah, however, is especially concerned with God’s relationship to man in the matter of life. Jehovah is part, a main element, of the wonderful name of Jesus, for Jesus means “Jehovah the Savior.” Since the name Jesus includes Jehovah, we may say that Jesus is the New Testament Jehovah and that Jehovah was the Old Testament Jesus. </p>

Thus, in these sections we have creation, corruption, and calling. Which of these do you love the most? I love God’s calling. We are not only the created ones but also the called ones. </p>

God’s eternal purpose is that man express Him with His image and represent Him with His dominion. We, the human race, are destined to express and represent God. This is clearly revealed in the first chapter of Genesis. In the second chapter we see God’s procedure to fulfill this divine purpose. His procedure is by the divine life. God must work Himself into us as our life that we might be able to fulfill His eternal purpose. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28356" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapter one</span> we see God’s purpose and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28357" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">chapter two</span> God’s procedure for the fulfillment of this purpose. </p>

The serpent corrupted man and caused him to fall to the uttermost. Man fell lower and lower until it was impossible for him to fall any further. At that time Satan was happy and could celebrate his success. The whole human race was in rebellion against God. In a sense, God had been driven out from the earth. </p>

All of Satan’s work simply affords Him an excellent opportunity to display His wisdom. Although sometimes I was sorry that I was a fallen person, most of the time I rejoiced, because I had been redeemed, regenerated, and regained. Because of the fall, our relationship with God the Father is sweeter and more meaningful than it would have been without the fall. If you will spend some time to review your life, I believe you will <span class="pg" data-page-id="499" id="499">[499]</span> weep, not in sorrow, but in sweet remembrance of God’s wise and gracious work. When we enter into eternity, we shall exercise our spirit and recall our time on earth, and the memory of that time will be sweet, tasteful, and meaningful. God is wise. He allowed the serpent to come in. God watched the serpent and seemed to say, “Little serpent, what are you doing? Go ahead and do more. The more you do, the more opportunity I have to manifest My wisdom. Little serpent, do your best. Go on until you are satisfied and can do nothing more.” Eventually, Satan had to say, “I have done all that I can do. I have exhausted myself in causing mankind to fall lower and lower. I cannot make him fall any further. This is all I can do. I am finished.” When this point was reached, God came in, not as Elohim, but as Jehovah, the seed that was promised in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28359" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">3:15</span>. Nothing can frustrate God, defeat Him, or force Him to forsake His eternal purpose. He will complete what He has determined to perform. Nothing can change Him. Any interruption simply affords Him the opportunity to express more of His wise counsel. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQIVn6fWVG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> If God had not been so wise, the book of Genesis would have been very short. But for God to display His wisdom, it has fifty chapters. The last thirty-nine and a half chapters are an abstract of the whole New Testament. Do you know how the New Testament begins? It begins with the words, “The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28360" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matt. 1:1</span>). According to the genealogy in Matthew, the gospel begins with Abraham. The New Testament begins with the genealogy of Abraham. This corresponds with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28361" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span>. Nearly everything found in the New Testament is sown as a seed in Genesis. So the thirty-nine and a half chapters that compose the third section of Genesis are a brief of the entire New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="uMdoZ7sIrphDxIxrKnqKnfuRCN9aZxYYQWIgd4x9rSnaU9KtTeicgVo8QagD4QHNt"> As we have pointed out on other occasions, the New Testament begins with the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom. When Jehovah came in to call Abraham in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28362" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span>, He gave him a promise, and that promise was the preaching of the gospel. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28363" data-verses="Galatians 3:8">Galatians 3:8</span> proves this: “The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham: In you all the nations shall be <span class="pg" data-page-id="500" id="500">[500]</span> blessed.” The first preaching of the gospel is not in Matthew but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28364" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span>. In the preaching of the gospel to Abraham, the main item is the nation. The nation is the kingdom. In the next message we shall see that God promised to make Abraham a great nation and that this nation is the kingdom of God including Israel as God’s kingdom in the Old Testament, the church as God’s kingdom in the New Testament, the millennial kingdom in the coming age, and also the new heaven and the new earth. This is the kingdom and this is the gospel of the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnmW98K6obQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28365" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">Galatians 3:14</span> speaks of the blessing of Abraham: “That the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.” What is the blessing? It is the Spirit. Who is the Spirit? The Spirit is Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28366" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>). The Spirit is Jesus, Jesus is Jehovah, and Jehovah is God. Therefore, this blessing is just God Himself. In God’s preaching of His gospel to Abraham, He promised the called ones that He would give Himself to them as a blessing. This blessing is Jehovah Himself. Jehovah is Jesus, and Jesus is the Spirit whom we have received through faith in Christ. This is the gospel. Remember, Genesis is a book giving us an abstract of the whole New Testament. How we must worship God for His sovereign wisdom! </p>
<p data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-ytt0v6AKBllPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo"> This long section of Genesis covers the lives of only three persons—Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. When God revealed Himself to Moses, He said, “I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28367" data-verses="Exodus 3:6">Exo. 3:6</span>). As we shall see later on, this is clearly related to the Triune God. The New Testament is simply an autobiography of the Triune God—of the Father in Abraham, the Son in Isaac, and the Spirit in Jacob. Perhaps some will wonder about Joseph. As we shall see, Joseph does not stand alone; he is a part of Jacob. The entire story of the called ones in the book of Genesis is a story of these three persons, and the whole New Testament is a record of the divine Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, experienced by all the New Testament believers. <span class="pg" data-page-id="501" id="501">[501]</span> </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6vmv5kpJWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ">THE BACKGROUND AND ORIGIN OF GOD’S CALLING<br/>AND THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CALLED</h1><p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWjyNC4s_gfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> Although Genesis is a long book, it has only three sections: God’s creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28401" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">1:1—2:25</span>), the serpent’s corruption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28402" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">3:1—11:9</span>), and Jehovah’s calling (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28403" data-verses="Genesis 11:10">11:10—50:26</span>). In the last message we saw the significance of God’s calling. God’s calling means the new beginning of God, the transfer of race, and the transfer of life. On our side, God’s calling is a transfer of race and life, but on God’s side it is a new beginning. God had a new beginning in His creation of man, but that man became corrupted. So God came in to have another beginning when He called Abraham. This new beginning is actually the transfer from the race of Adam to the race of Abraham, a transfer from the created race to the called race. God’s calling means that we are called out of the original, created race into the present, called race. This transfer of race is not merely positional but also dispositional, for it is actually a transfer of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXkUfZgMS0wrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip"> Abraham experienced both a positional and dispositional transfer. He was transferred from the old land of Chaldea to the good land of Canaan. That was a positional transfer. However, God worked upon him inwardly as well as outwardly. At a certain time, God came in and told him that his name had to be changed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28404" data-verses="Genesis 17:5">17:5</span>). According to the Bible, the changing of name always indicates the changing in life. When Abraham’s name was changed, it meant that his disposition, his life, was being changed. It seems that God was telling Abraham, “You are still in your old man. You are too much in your natural life. Although you have been called out of the old race, the nature and life of the old race still remain in you, and you still live by that life. It is necessary for Me to deal with you. I must <span class="pg" data-page-id="512" id="512">[512]</span> cut off that life.” This cutting off of the old life was signified by circumcision. Abraham’s circumcision transpired at the same time that God changed his name. Outwardly, his name was changed, and inwardly, his disposition, his nature, and his life were dealt with. After the strength of Abraham’s natural life had been cut off, Isaac was born at “the time of life.” In a very real sense, Isaac was not born of Abraham’s natural strength; he was born of God’s coming, for God had said, “At the time appointed I will return unto thee, at the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28405" data-verses="Genesis 18:14">18:14</span>, Heb.). The coming of the Lord was the birth of Isaac. This means that Isaac was not produced out of Abraham’s natural strength but out of a life dealt with by God. We see by this that Abraham was not only transferred positionally but also dispositionally. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LmYkOaBjKrZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> Apparently Isaac did not need a transfer of life. Nevertheless, Esau, the first of the twins born to Isaac and Rebekah, was very natural. God will never accept anything that is natural. Since the first of Isaac’s sons was so natural, God chose the second. The firstborn signifies the natural life. For this reason, God destroyed the lives of all the firstborn in Egypt during the night of the Passover. The second, on the contrary, signifies the transferred life. Because Jacob was the second, he was chosen. </p>
<p data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtqI2EiKPD_u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m"> Although Jacob had been chosen, his nature was not transferred. So, at a certain time, God came in and touched Jacob’s natural strength. At that time his name was changed from Jacob, a supplanter, to Israel, a prince of God. From then on, Jacob was lame. His lameness was a sign that he had been touched by God, that his natural strength had been dealt with, and that he had become a prince of God. This is the true meaning of God’s calling. </p>
<p data-content-id="6CXs4WE0BL6-B1B4FDiAFr5sucj3zGKjTYJeRnGmeXBe72gXmUfpgBoC9qhDjO81n"> Have you been called? If you say that you have been called, then you must come out of Chaldea, Babel, the old race, and your natural life. You must get out of your natural life and get your natural life out of you. In God’s calling there is the need of the new beginning, the transfer of race, and the transfer of life. We all need to be transferred. In all the years that I have been here with the saints, I have been watching <span class="pg" data-page-id="513" id="513">[513]</span> the process of this transfer. I have been happy to see so many saints undergoing the transfer of life. Although at times the process of this transfer is not pleasant, after awhile you can see in the saints the real transfer of life. This is the meaning of God’s calling. </p>

<p data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2ySuOYwNY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df"> Now in this message we need to see the experience of the called ones. But before we come to this, we need to consider the background and origin of God’s calling. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ss-Kv9Ptsxb3Hpm3OLvQWTwy3WUZkwLJkPM-9Yo5gpNrugTwkZhE_qWQlLbkcq0fN"> When God appeared to Abraham, he was in the darkest background. His background was exceedingly strong. The first aspect of this background was that man had forsaken God. Man’s forsaking of God was signified by his building a city. We saw this in the case of Cain in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28406" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">chapter four</span>. Man built a city because he had lost God as his protection. Since man no longer had God as his safeguard, he built a city to protect himself. So the building of the city was the sign that man had forsaken God. Man seemed to be saying, “Let God go. I will build a city to protect myself.” The building of the city was the declaration that man had forsaken God. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="gUDsBBjBPjRtaf2PAgd0RIG2Jne1KXdsQrQ3vEcVWKTvzkKR8PehPPTdnoCg5OrXo">2.

The tower was a sign of man’s self-exaltation. When man forsakes God, automatically he exalts himself. Whenever man builds a city he will also build a tower to make a name for himself. </p>

Both man and the earth were God’s creation. Nevertheless, man would not recognize God’s right but instead established the nations. The establishing of nations signified that man had denied God’s right and authority. As we have seen, after the flood God gave man the authority to rule others, but Satan caused man to abuse this God-given <span class="pg" data-page-id="514" id="514">[514]</span> authority to form nations that man may have his own dominion, denying God’s right and authority over man. </p>

Behind all the idols are demons. Whenever a man worships an idol, he worships demons. Apparently he is worshipping idols; actually he is worshipping demons. </p>
<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWIBfBEo6tXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> As the background of God’s calling we have the city, the tower, the nations, and the demons. Man had forsaken God, had exalted himself, had denied God’s right and authority, and had turned from God to serve idols. Do you believe that the situation is any better today? I do not believe it. It is as bad today as it was then. The situation is exactly the same. </p>

The Origin of God’s Calling—God</h2><p data-content-id="Vyv6cezndY8yrw_ApV0zPe0K7FLaJbjcYWxSSt0SaXZR8SPfWLyu4As---ucS3eoN"> Who originated this calling? Abraham did not originate it. Although he was the father of the called race, the calling was not initiated by him. I believe that Abraham was the same as we are today. He never dreamed of being called by God. Suddenly, while he and his relatives were there in Chaldea worshipping other gods (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28408" data-verses="Joshua 24:2">Josh. 24:2</span>), God appeared to him. God was the originator of this calling. </p>

God selected Abraham in eternity past. After that, also in eternity past, God predestinated, premarked, Abraham. Before Abraham was born, even before the foundation of the world when nothing but God Himself was in existence, God chose Abraham and predestinated him. One day, in time, while Abraham was worshipping other gods, having no forethought that he was to be called by God, God visited him. God just came in as the very God of glory. Abraham was surprised. The God of glory not only came to Abraham, but He appeared to him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="515" id="515">[515]</span> </p>

If we are going to get into the last section of the book of Genesis, the section on God’s calling, we need to remember that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not three separate and complete units but, under God’s dispensation, are one complete corporate man. God dealt with each of them as a part of a complete unit. Their experiences are not three separate individual experiences but the aspects of one complete experience. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9Bn7phKEq6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr">2. The First Aspect—The Experience of Abraham</h2><p data-content-id="FyrUURSenH7AUUlr0ndgcu8kHnz-vlth22OadvBKOnc_QUvWSaFJlMIPAfMT2Bdu2"> In this message we need to see the first aspect of the complete experience of God’s called ones. This aspect is fully shown in Abraham’s life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28450" data-verses="Genesis 11:10">11:10—25:18</span>). This is quite basic. Abraham’s life is an illustration of the first aspect of the complete experience of God’s called ones. His experience goes from being called, through the living by faith in fellowship, to the knowing of grace. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="CAIiqFyjjgw0LbNxWLi5D9I7-xSGcXq_WajUO0fMiI1qsIetqtq6bkTvknnO7bFYb">a.

<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_Sgw1BeJgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds">1) The Motive and Strength</h2><p data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-ytt0vCAKBFlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo"> As God’s calling did not originate with the called one but with the God who calls, so the motive and strength to receive God’s calling did not originate from the side of the called one <span class="pg" data-page-id="528" id="528">[528]</span> but from the side of the calling One. The motive and the strength whereby Abraham could answer God’s calling came from God Himself. What was this motive and strength? If we look into the situation in a detailed way, we can see three things that motivated Abraham to accept God’s calling: God’s appearing, God’s calling, and God’s promise. Now we need to consider each of these items. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXQ0T9focO443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP">a) God’s Appearing</h2><p data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkw_x2eNTuoPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU"> The first aspect of the motive and strength to accept God’s calling was God’s appearing. If I were to come to you, it would mean nothing because I am nothing. If the president of the United States were to pay you a personal visit, you would be very excited. Probably you would be unable to sleep for a whole night. But who came to visit Abraham? The God of glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28451" data-verses="Acts 7:2">Acts 7:2</span>). Outside of Stephen’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28452" data-verses="Acts 7:2">Acts 7:2</span>, where Stephen told his persecutors that the God of glory appeared to their father Abraham, there is no other verse in the Bible that says that the God of glory appeared to Abraham. While Stephen was speaking, the Jesus of glory appeared to him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28453" data-verses="Acts 7:55-56">Acts 7:55-56</span>). The heavens were opened and he saw Jesus in glory standing on the right hand of God. Stephen was bold to die for Jesus because, while they were opposing him, he saw the Lord Jesus. The people stoned him, but Jesus smiled at him. Because the Lord appeared to him, it was easy, even a great joy, for him to undergo persecution. There was no comparison between that persecution and the appearing of Jesus in glory. Because Stephen was in such a situation, the Jesus in glory appeared to him. Without such an appearing, his environment would have been too difficult for a human being to take. </p>
<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6PK1abiP9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> In the same principle, the God of glory appeared to Abraham, paying him a visit with His personal appearance, because, at that time, Abraham was under the influence of a strong background in Chaldea. As we shall see in the next message, Chaldea in Hebrew means demonic. Chaldea was a demonic place, a place full of demons. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28454" data-verses="Joshua 24:2">Joshua 24:2</span> says that Abraham and his family served other gods. They worshipped idols, and behind the idols were demons. <span class="pg" data-page-id="529" id="529">[529]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjINoH8T5cGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD"> Chaldea was in a land called Mesopotamia. The word Mesopotamia means “between rivers.” According to geography, the region of Mesopotamia was bound by two great rivers, the Euphrates (Perath in Hebrew) and the Tigris (Hiddekel in Hebrew). Between these two rivers was a great plain, the land of Mesopotamia. Chaldea was a part of Mesopotamia. This means that Abraham’s dwelling place was not only in a place full of demons but also in a place that was enclosed by two great rivers. It was very difficult for him or any other person to leave such a place, for the demons held him and the great rivers enclosed him. Since there was no modern transportation, the people had to walk. How was Abraham able to get out of Chaldea? Since his background was so strong, God appeared to him in order that he might come out of it. </p>
<p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qd29Ix_1dzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> This is a picture, an illustration, of our situation before we were saved. We all were in a Chaldea. All the young people need to realize that every junior high school is a Chaldea, a place filled with demons. So many of the students are little demons selling drugs and trying to hold you back, saying, “How can you be different from us? If you want to be different from us, where shall you go? There are two great rivers that keep you here. You must stay with us!” Sometimes the husbands are demons to the wives and the wives are demons to the husbands. As far as the worldly people are concerned, whenever a young man gets married he enters into a demonic region. The same is true for every young woman who marries. Consider the example of a young man who falls in love with a certain young lady. This young woman has a tremendous background composed of a great many relatives and friends, all of whom are demonic. If this young man were to marry her, he would fall into a demonic region. If he came to me, I would say, “Don’t think that this young lady is so pretty, nice, and kind. You must look into her background. You are not only marrying her—you are marrying her with her whole background. After you marry a girl with such a demonic background, you will find yourself in Chaldea. The demons there will hold you.” But God has chosen this young man. Do not think that it will be easy for him to believe in the Lord Jesus and be saved. It is not a matter of being saved and <span class="pg" data-page-id="530" id="530">[530]</span> waiting to go to heaven. No, in the Bible, to be saved is to be called out of your background, region, and environment. You need to get yourself out. </p>
<p data-content-id="aGZQhn44RfDLbiYsGGvVES4MVru3KCGvuVmdAiPygWOGRgcCG0VL2WETay77K2O7o"> As we have seen, God’s promise to Abraham was a preaching of the gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28455" data-verses="Galatians 3:8">Gal. 3:8</span>). As part of this preaching, God told Abraham to get out of his country. What would you have done if you had been Abraham? Behind Sarah there might have been many demons, and these demons would not agree with Abraham’s getting out of Chaldea. This was the reason that the God of glory appeared to Abraham. It was neither an angel nor a dignified person who appeared to Abraham but the God of glory Himself who appeared to him. That appearing was a great attraction, inciting Abraham to take God’s calling. </p>
<p data-content-id="bdPZiOYGTI0GDMWc0r7m5RfANGetCY4FzwTm0_1hM378LkILri-YBA6MHtvxUHmDQ"> In Matthew we are told that as Jesus walked by the sea of Galilee He called Peter, Andrew, James, and John (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28456" data-verses="Matthew 4:18-22">Matt. 4:18-22</span>). The Lord Jesus simply said to them, “Follow Me,” and they followed Him. For many years I was unable to understand this. The little Jesus of Nazareth spoke the words, “Follow Me,” and they followed Him. I did not understand this until one day I noticed that the Jesus who walked by the sea of Galilee was a great light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28457" data-verses="Matthew 4:16">Matt. 4:16</span>). Peter, Andrew, James, and John were all attracted by that great light. When Jesus looked at them and called them, they were attracted to Him. Apparently, the One who called them was a poor Nazarene; actually, He was the God of glory. Likewise, the God of glory appeared to Abraham in the land of demons, a land enclosed by great waters. I believe that, in principle, we all have experienced such an appearing. To be saved is not merely a matter of hearing the preaching of the gospel, nodding your head, and then confessing that you are a sinner and that you believe in the Lord Jesus. Although this is correct, I must say that a true saved one is one who has had the appearing of Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIISPiGwD_D0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs"> In our conversion many seemed to see “the glory of God in the face of Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28458" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:6">2 Cor. 4:6</span>). This became a great stimulation to so many of us. </p>

In this message we come to the seed of river crossing, to the experience of the first river crosser. What is river crossing? It is the real and actual following of the Lord. Following the Lord is a matter of crossing the river. Although it is easy to talk about river crossing, it is not easy to have the real river crossing according to the experience of Abraham. In this message we need to see how Abraham crossed the river. His experience, an example for us all, is another of the seeds sown in Genesis. This seed is now growing in so many of us. How we need the growth of this seed! </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnmXNgK7svQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM">2) The Progress</h2><h2 class="head6" data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-ytt1fmAL1tlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo">a) Called the First Time at Ur of Chaldea in Mesopotamia</h2>
<p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXQ1jZfp4i443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> The best way to study the Word is to compare one portion of it with another. We may do this with respect to the calling of Abraham, for his calling is mentioned in both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28484" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28485" data-verses="Acts 7:1">Acts 7</span>. By the help of the Lord, it is easy for us to see the comparison in these two passages. We can see from these two portions of the Word that the God of glory appeared to Abraham twice. God did not come to him once for all. This is not our guess; it is proved by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28486" data-verses="Acts 7:2">Acts 7:2</span> which says that the God of glory appeared to Abraham before he dwelt in Haran, while he was still in Mesopotamia. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28487" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12:1</span> indicates that after Abraham had dwelt in Haran for a time, God appeared to him again. By these two verses we see that God appeared to Abraham in two different places: at Ur of Chaldea and at Haran. It is certain that these two callings did not occur at the same time. The first call came while Abraham’s father <span class="pg" data-page-id="540" id="540">[540]</span> was still alive, and the second came after his father had died. This is a strong proof that God appeared to Abraham twice. </p>
<p data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkw-BSePHOoPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU"> There is a very crucial difference between these two callings of God. In the first calling God told Abraham to get out of his country and his kindred (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28488" data-verses="Acts 7:3">Acts 7:3</span>). In the second calling God told him to get out of his country, his kindred, and his father’s house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28489" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Gen. 12:1</span>). When God called Abraham the second time, He not only mentioned Abraham’s kindred in a general way but his father’s house in a particular way. It was not sufficient for him to leave his kindred; he had to come out of his father’s house. Later on we shall see the reason for this. But now we can see that Abraham experienced two different callings at two different places. In the first calling God told him to get out of his country and his kindred, and in the second calling He told him to get out of his country, his kindred, <em>and his father’s house.</em> </p>
<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6O6RaZmr9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> Once we see this matter of the two callings, everything is clear. When I was young, I was told by certain teachers that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28490" data-verses="Acts 7:1">Acts 7</span> was a quotation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28491" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span>. These teachers never pointed out clearly that God called Abraham twice. Perhaps some of you reading this message still hold on to the concept that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28492" data-verses="Acts 7:1">Acts 7</span> is a quotation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28493" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span>. But the call in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28494" data-verses="Acts 7:1">Acts 7</span> occurred before Abraham was brought to Haran, and the call in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28495" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span> happened after he had lived there for a time. The call in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28496" data-verses="Acts 7:1">Acts 7</span> preceded the call in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28497" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="h08U91ltZnqTUI0aV0g56myiiI8qCw-cZTKHrVo12qTwS3OgmpjHqkUk9BKO83GId">b) Not Obeying God’s Calling Right Away</h2><p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWJx_BEoatXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> Why did God need to appear to Abraham twice and call him twice? Why did God need to repeat His calling? As far as God was concerned, there was no need for Him to repeat His calling. It was Abraham who needed the repetition. There is hardly one who has experienced God’s calling just once and then immediately crossed the river. No one among us has ever answered God’s calling without dragging his feet through mud and water. Hardly anyone has ever given a clean-cut answer to God’s calling. You may say, “What about Peter and John when they were called by the Lord by the Sea of Galilee? The Lord called them, and they followed Him immediately.” If you read other portions of the Word, you will see that even <span class="pg" data-page-id="541" id="541">[541]</span> these disciples were dragging their feet. It is difficult to have a clean-cut answer to God’s calling. We always drag our feet through mud and water. Our relatives might be the mud and we ourselves might be the water. Although you might have received the calling from God, you allow your relatives to be the mud through which you drag your feet. And you yourself are the water, the dirty and black water. You drag your feet through this mud and water. </p>
<p data-content-id="MtCll2XOY8R8dFgTUXdR4bdM7Xob8JwNRjNJM9TIVoQfsRCA1WYTsZI35lh9oQ1PX"> While Abraham was living at Ur, the God of glory suddenly appeared to him. This appearing brought in light. (The name Ur means light.) In a demonic land, a land full of demons (Chaldea means demonic), the God of glory appeared and brought in light. This is very meaningful. Whenever God comes to call a man, there is always light. While Saul of Tarsus was on the way to Damascus to persecute the Christians there, a light from heaven shone upon him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28498" data-verses="Acts 9:1-3">Acts 9:1-3</span>). At that moment, Saul was at Ur. He was under the light. When you were called, you also were under the light. You saw that your place, your environment and surroundings, was not the right place for you to stay any longer. You were called at Ur, the place of light. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="Vyv6cezndY8yrw_ApV0zPfEq7F7SJbjcYWxSSt0SaXZR8SPfWLyu4As---ucS3eoN">c) Taken to Haran by His Father after His Brother’s Death</h2><p data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8AfonztgdnKuNKoc1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq"> I believe that Abraham received God’s calling when he was young. He might have told his father, Terah, and his relatives how God had appeared to him and had told him to get out of his country and his kindred. Abraham probably did not have the boldness to do this himself. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28499" data-verses="Genesis 11:28">11:28</span> we are told that “Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.” Haran might have been Abraham’s older brother and he might have opposed God’s calling to Abraham. It might have been that God waited a certain period of time. When Abraham still did not take any action, God took away Haran, the opposing one. Haran might have been Terah’s eldest son. The eldest son’s death might have been a warning to the father not to tarry any longer. The name Terah means to tarry, to delay, or to be laggard. Terah took the whole family, went forth with them from Ur of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="542" id="542">[542]</span> Chaldees, and dwelt in Haran (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28500" data-verses="Genesis 11:31">11:31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28501" data-verses="Acts 7:4">Acts 7:4a</span>). It was not Abraham who took the initiative to leave Ur; it was his father. </p>
<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6uWP5kN1WapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> Terah and his family might have traveled northward along the side of the river Euphrates. Eventually, after a journey of at least five hundred miles, they came to Haran. According to the ancient method of travel, it must have taken over half a month to travel from Ur to Haran. But although they made such a long journey, they never crossed the river as God wanted them to. How many years have you been dragging along the side of the river without crossing it? You may say, “Praise the Lord that I am no longer in Ur.” Right, you are not in Ur, but you are still on the other side of the river. Even in the church life you have been journeying along the riverside without crossing the river. Many of you have journeyed northward but are still on the other side. But even this journey northward was caused by God’s doing. </p>
<p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWjz9i4trQfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> At Ur there was a person named Haran, and now we see a city with the same name. This means that they left one Haran and came into another. In the eyes of God, both are the same. Whether Haran is a person or a place, it is still Haran. The name Haran means dry. When the elder brother was opposing God’s calling, he must have been dry. Any relative who tries to prevent you from accepting the Lord’s calling is a dry one, and any place that hinders you from answering God’s calling is a dry place. You can never be watered there. In such a place you have the sensation of dryness. Many of us have experienced this. </p>

As the first book in the Bible, Genesis is not a book of doctrine; it is a book of history. It is not a history in a human way but in a very divine way. Genesis uses the biographies of some ancient saints to tell us something that is so divine. The divine revelation is contained in the human lives, in the human stories, of the people in Genesis. In this message we need to see the divine revelation found in Abraham’s experience of living by faith. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="yObOo7LOjjFarxWXeCIo4NQs-X-nfP03Kiwq9oNdUXzgDgrb2yrYAyxlelIIkT9lp">b. Living by Faith</h2><p data-content-id="8UouUokiSDmfQ5btvmO_u8CBcxyULW5y_xM7y0Cjh31lO6uhzd5IR1LXaUCBwG1Zr"> In some of the preceding messages we have seen that the experience of the called ones has three aspects, the aspects of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The first stage of the first aspect, the aspect of Abraham, was Abraham’s being called by God. We have covered this point adequately in the last two messages. Now we come to the second stage of the experience of Abraham—living by faith, or we may say a life by faith. When we speak of a life by faith, we do not mean the life within but the life without, that is, the daily living, the daily walk, of the called ones. This daily walk is not by sight but by faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28523" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:7">2 Cor. 5:7</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="0JV8hDILxxkbeRl9MfljI59_qwfFVL0iYCHdxKUekJ14F8oFrW_U5yl_qzhcrk_AB"> Abraham’s history is a seed. The entire biography of Abraham is a seed. It is not a seed of doctrine but a seed of our history. Abraham’s history is the seed of our history because our history grows out of his history. In a sense, we and Abraham are one in the experience of life. We, the believers, are the true descendants of Abraham, and he is the true father of everyone who has been called by God. When we read his biography, we are also reading our own. His story is about us. As <span class="pg" data-page-id="552" id="552">[552]</span> we read all of the chapters in Genesis about Abraham, we must read them in the way of realizing that his story is our story. </p>
<p data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYQrsoVm4lMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx"> We need to see the steps that we must take in following the Lord. The first step is being called, and the second is living by faith. Have you been called? You must strongly say, “Amen, I have been called.” Abraham was the first to be called, and, as we have seen, he did not answer God’s calling in a clean-cut way but in the way of dragging his feet through mud and water. Our story is the same. Our answer to the Lord’s calling was exactly the same as his. In principle, the seed is on a small scale, the growth is on a greater scale, and the harvest is on the greatest scale. We have seen that when Abraham left Haran, he took Lot with him. Did you not bring a Lot with you? If Abraham, the seed, brought one Lot, then it is probable that each one of us has brought many Lots. I am afraid that some of those reading this message have brought more than ten Lots with them. By this we see that our history is found in Abraham’s biography. </p>
<p data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZhwjrXBsp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6"> Regardless of how much Abraham dragged his feet through the mud and water, God was still sovereign. God is God. Abraham was not only called; he was caught. He came out of his country, his kindred, and his father’s house, and was brought to Moreh, the place where God wanted him to be and where He reappeared to him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28524" data-verses="Genesis 12:6-7">12:6-7</span>). God’s reappearing was a seal to Abraham’s answer to His calling. God’s calling was clean-cut, but Abraham’s answer to God’s calling was not. Nevertheless, eventually God received a full answer to His calling. I do not care how much the young brothers and sisters drag their feet. Sooner or later, they will be fully caught. The Christian workers and the leading brothers must have the faith never to be disappointed with the brothers and sisters. Never feel that a particular brother is beyond hope. Rather, we must say that there is much hope with that brother. Simply wait awhile and you will see that everyone will come to Moreh. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIIT_CGwDfD0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs">1) Strength—the Appearance of God</h2><p data-content-id="yObOo7LOjjFarxWXeCIo4NQs-W6LfP03Kiwq9oNdUXzgDgrb2yrYAyxlelIIkT9lp"> At Moreh God reappeared to Abraham and he met God <span class="pg" data-page-id="553" id="553">[553]</span> again (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28525" data-verses="Genesis 12:6">12:6</span>). If you say that you have been called, I would ask you this question: What is the seal of your calling? The seal of our calling is God’s reappearance. God’s reappearance, His coming again to us, is the seal of our answer to His calling. The reappearing of God to Abraham was the strength that enabled him to live by faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="8UouUokiSDmfQ5btvmO_u8CBcwG0LW5y_xM7y0Cjh31lO6uhzd5IR1LXaUCBwG1Zr"> If you read the record in Genesis, you will see that during Abraham’s time mankind lived in the way of building a strong city for their protection and erecting a high tower for making themselves a name. That was the living of the humankind at Babel. But Abraham lived in an absolutely different way. His living was an anti-testimony to the way of the humankind, to the way that had been fully developed at Babel. As we saw in message thirty-six, at Babel there was a great city built by man. This city was not built with God-created stones but with man-made bricks. Those bricks were made by killing the element in the soil that grows life. But Abraham, the called one, did not live in that way. With Abraham, there was no city and no tower. After God’s reappearing as the seal to Abraham’s answer to God’s calling, Abraham immediately built an altar, not to make a name for himself but to call upon the name of the Lord. Why did Abraham do this? Because he had the reappearing of God. How was he able to do this? Also because he had the reappearing of God. Remember that the record in Genesis concerning Abraham is a biography, not a doctrine, religion, or tradition. Abraham did not build an altar because of teaching or religious tradition. He built it because God had reappeared to him. God’s reappearing meant everything to him. It not only sealed Abraham’s answer to God’s calling; it also strengthened him to live in a way that was absolutely different from the way of all of the humankind. It caused him to live as an anti-testimony to his generation. The altar that Abraham built was an anti-testimony to the tower of Babel. </p>

Our God never does anything without a purpose and He never acts in a meaningless way. Everything He does is purposeful and meaningful. After <span class="pg" data-page-id="554" id="554">[554]</span> Abraham answered God’s calling, believing in Him and obeying Him, he came to the oak of Moreh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28526" data-verses="Genesis 12:6-7">12:6-7</span>). When he came to that place, God reappeared to him because he had believed in God’s calling and had obeyed it. As one who believed and obeyed God’s calling, Abraham had no choice of the place where he should stay. God called Abraham a second time at Haran, and he crossed the river there, beginning a long journey. While he was on this long journey, he did not have his own choice. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28527" data-verses="Hebrews 11:8">Hebrews 11:8</span> tells us that Abraham did not know where he was going. He had no road map in his hand. His road map was a living Person, the living God. While he was journeying, he had to look to God continually; he could not stop at any place he chose. As he was traveling, God’s presence was his direction, his road map. He followed God in this way until he arrived at Moreh. At Moreh, God appeared to him. That appearing of God at Moreh indicated that Abraham had come to the place where God wanted him to be. There God told Abraham that He would give that land to his descendants. </p>
<p data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZhwjrVFQp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6"> God’s first appearing to us does not depend upon us at all. It is God who initiates that calling. However, after the initial appearing, every other appearing depends upon our condition. Although God’s first appearing is initiated by Him and does not depend upon us, the subsequent appearings depend upon our condition. If Abraham had not arrived at Moreh, he would not have had God’s reappearing, the reappearing that strengthened him to go on with God. This going on with God was Abraham’s living by faith in God. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQdiVHrMfFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B">THE TRIAL OF THE CALLED</h1><p data-content-id="QMSNPOcCBLw6v-EOydvwYEV9Iu8TduX4YH5_O01lRUzkJdbjHu_x8PZ2HwO74uIjb"> In this message we come to Abraham’s experience of trials. We have seen how Abraham was called by God and how, by God’s appearing, he was strengthened to answer that call. We have also seen that, by God’s appearing, Abraham was brought to the very place where God intended him to be. Firstly he was brought to Shechem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28551" data-verses="Genesis 12:6">12:6</span>) and then to the place between Bethel and Ai, the place between the house of God and the heap of ruins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28552" data-verses="Genesis 12:8">12:8</span>). That place between the house of God and the heap of ruins was the high point, and Abraham should have remained there. </p>
<p data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7Wnreekz93ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo"> However, suddenly, after such a high attainment in his experience of God, Abraham continued his journey, going toward the south (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28553" data-verses="Genesis 12:9">12:9</span>). In studying this chapter, I have spent much time to find out the reason why Abraham continued his journey. Why did he journey on and not remain there between the house of God and the heap of ruins? Abraham had attained the high point, the place where God intended for him to be. By God’s mercy, he should have remained there. But Abraham journeyed southward. This means that he went downward. After such a high attainment in the experience of God, any journey would be downward. This continuing of his journey was the cause of Abraham’s failure. </p>
<p data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKQgicn2UXCaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI"> We have seen that, at the beginning, Abraham dragged his feet through mud and water. Eventually, he was victorious, going all the way to Shechem and afterward to the place near Bethel. That was wonderful. In both of those places he built an altar and at the place between Bethel and Ai he also called upon the name of the Lord and pitched his tent as a declaration to the whole world that he was an anti-testimony to the situation at Babel. Do you not think that in doing so <span class="pg" data-page-id="566" id="566">[566]</span> Abraham had arrived, attained the high point of his experience of God? </p>
<p data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnDn8802jEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB"> Perhaps you are thinking that if you had been Abraham, you surely would have remained there. But we should not think this way, for we are today’s Abraham. The ancient Abraham was just like us. As we have pointed out elsewhere, Abraham’s experience was a seed of our own experience. The record of Abraham in Genesis is his biography, but it is our autobiography. You may say, “No, it is Abraham’s autobiography and my biography.” But this record is your autobiography not your biography, because the biography of Abraham was written by Moses and your biography is written by yourself. Abraham’s experience corresponds with ours. We and he are one. Have you not had a wonderful time with the Lord in which you reached the high point and shouted, “Hallelujah! How good it is here! No place is better than this place. This is the best place for me to be.” Have you not said this? But what happened the very next day? You began to journey downward. The night before you said, “Hallelujah, this is the place for me,” and the next morning you began to journey downward to the border of Egypt. This means that you journeyed to a place that was so close to the world, close to the movie theaters. One night you were on the high point in Canaan and the next morning you were moving downward to the border of the world. Has this not happened to you? I am so happy and surprised to hear the junior high young people offer such wonderful prayers in the meetings. But I need to say an honest word to them; I do not trust you. After praying such a wonderful prayer one night in the meeting, the next morning you may journey downward to the border of worldly entertainments. Today you may say, “Hallelujah, this is the best place for me,” and next weekend you may move downward to the movie theater. Remember that we are today’s Abraham. It is easy to reach the high point, but it is not easy to remain there. There is not much room on the high point. If you move just slightly, you will fall downhill. It is very difficult to keep the God-appointed position. The high point is surrounded by pits, and it is easy to fall into one of them. The called ones will not usually go backward, but it is easy for them to go <span class="pg" data-page-id="567" id="567">[567]</span> downward into Egypt. Abraham never went back to Chaldea, but he did go down into Egypt. </p>

The word trial is not a pleasant word. No one likes to experience trials. Do you like to have trials in your life? Although no one likes trials, they are good experiences. Not too long after Abraham was called and began to live by faith, a trial came to him. Do not pray, “Lord, You are so good to me. Don’t let any trials come to me.” This kind of prayer will only hasten the coming of the trials. The Lord will answer your prayer in just the opposite way. If you say, “Lord, don’t send any trials,” the Lord will say, “I will send a trial very quickly.” I am assured that no one can say that since he was called by the Lord he has always enjoyed good times. No one can say that. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LmZUmaAXirZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> Our God is not only the God of love but also the God of sovereignty. Our God is sovereign. Our God is not only the God of love, the God of light, and the God of life, but also the God of sovereignty. Everything is under His dispensation. He manages the whole world just for us. We must all believe that God manages the entire universe for every one of us. You may say, “How small I am! How could the sovereign God manage the universe just for me?” But He does manage it just for you. You must believe this. You are not so small that God does not sovereignly arrange your environment for you. You are big enough to have God’s sovereign arrangement. I have learned this from my own experience. Fifty years ago I did not like this story of Abraham going down to Egypt. I simply could not be happy with that experience. When, at that time, I read some messages on Abraham’s downward experience, I did not understand it and did not feel good about it. I even questioned God. But now, after many years of experience, I am very happy. How we need to hear this message on Abraham’s trial! </p>
<p data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtqJGsiLrv_u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m"> It is easy to reach the high point in our experience with God, but it is not easy to remain there. Look at the environment that surrounds you on every side. It was sovereignly arranged before you were born. God is sovereign. Although <span class="pg" data-page-id="568" id="568">[568]</span> you may consider yourself a small creature, as far as God is concerned, you are a very important person. Before the foundation of the world, God arranged everything for you. He even arranged that you would be reading this message right now. We are under God’s arrangement. Do not try to escape. If you escape to a certain place, you will find that place to be the exact place that God arranged for you. When you reach old age, you will bow down and say, “Lord, I am fully convinced that You arranged everything for me before the foundation of the world.” </p>
<p data-content-id="6CXs4WE0BL6-B1B4FDiAFqJEue3XzGKjTYJeRnGmeXBe72gXmUfpgBoC9qhDjO81n"> Abraham’s trial was for him to learn a lesson. We all need to learn some lessons.

He had to live by trusting in God for his daily needs. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28555" data-verses="Genesis 12:10">12:10</span> we read that there was a grievous famine in the land. This famine was a test to see whether or not Abraham would trust in God in the matter of making a living, in the matter of his daily living. </p>

<p data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2ziCOZ0hY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df"> In this message we come to the victory in Abraham’s experience (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28579" data-verses="Genesis 14:11-24">14:11-24</span>). If we read the book of Genesis carefully, we shall see that apart from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28580" data-verses="Genesis 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> it does not relate much concerning the international affairs among the Gentiles. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28581" data-verses="Genesis 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> gives us a record concerning the international fighting among the Gentiles. Why is there such a record? The wording in the Bible is very economical. Not one word is wasted. Nevertheless, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28582" data-verses="Genesis 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> is almost entirely concerned with the international fighting among the Gentile kingdoms. The events in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28583" data-verses="Genesis 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>, however, are not just related to international affairs but are sovereignly related to God’s people. Why does this chapter dedicate such a lengthy word to the international fighting among the Gentiles? Although this fighting apparently was international, actually it was sovereignly arranged by the Lord. God is sovereign over the environment and over all the events concerning His people. In the land of Canaan at that time, there were only two families of the Hebrew race—the family of Abraham and the family of Lot. All of the rest were Gentiles. In this chapter we see that God was sovereign, causing something to happen for the good of His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ss-Kv9Ptsxb3Hpm3OLvQWSAe3Xg5kwLJkPM-9Yo5gpNrugTwkZhE_qWQlLbkcq0fN"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28584" data-verses="Genesis 14:1">Chapter fourteen</span> of Genesis relates the fighting between a group of four kings and a group of five kings. Eventually, the five kings were defeated by the four kings. If you read carefully, you will see this fighting was absolutely for Lot and for Abraham. In other words, both Lot and Abraham, the two Hebrews, were put to the test under God’s sovereignty. Was this fighting good or not? Humanly speaking, no fighting is good. However, in this chapter the fighting was good for Lot <span class="pg" data-page-id="578" id="578">[578]</span> and especially for Abraham. In this message we need to see the profitable aspects related to God’s people in this fighting. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="gUDsBBjBPjRtaf2PAgd0RJ2aJm6RKXdsQrQ3vEcVWKTvzkKR8PehPPTdnoCg5OrXo">a) The Captivity of the Brother</h2><p data-content-id="e4Tu7RSEEn956Bu43KIdFttdelQZLhbqE99G8qhMhliWdoAMPEcx2IgxrawDytCgr"> The fighting occurred mainly at Sodom. It mainly happened at Sodom because one of God’s people, Lot, was living there. Before the time of that fighting, Lot had separated himself from Abraham (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28585" data-verses="Genesis 13:11">13:11</span>). Do you think that it was good for Lot to have separated himself from Abraham? No, it was not good. All of the young people today like to be separated from the older generation. In God’s economy, however, it is not good for the young ones to be separated from the older generation. If you do this, you will miss the mark and the protection. At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28586" data-verses="Genesis 13:1">Genesis 13</span>, God’s goal and eternal mark were with Abraham. If you had been there and had separated yourself from him, it would have been equal to separating yourself from God’s mark. God’s goal is with the called ones. If you separate yourself from the called ones, you separate yourself from God’s goal. Lot should never have separated himself from Abraham, because God’s goal was with Abraham. To leave Abraham was to leave God’s mark. Moreover, to leave Abraham was to leave the protection. </p>
<p data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_LUPGUMF0w3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj"> Lot was not firstly defeated by the four kings. That defeat was the issue of at least two foregoing defeats. Before Lot was captured by Chedorlaomer, he already had had two defeats. The first defeat occurred when Lot’s herdmen were striving against Abraham’s herdmen and Abraham offered Lot the choice of the land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28587" data-verses="Genesis 13:7-11">13:7-11</span>). When Abraham offered the choice to Lot, Lot should have said, “Uncle, my choice is you. My choice is your choice. I don’t like to make any choice of my own. If my herdmen will not listen to me, I will fire them, but I will never go away from you. I have no choice but you and your choice.” But, on the contrary, when Abraham gave him his choice, immediately, without much consideration, Lot made his choice and went his way. That was his first defeat. </p>
<p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2NhSInS9iDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> After separating from Abraham, “Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28588" data-verses="Genesis 13:12">13:12</span>). Lot was going downhill. After taking the first step downward, it was easy for him to take the second and the third. The first <span class="pg" data-page-id="579" id="579">[579]</span> step was leaving Abraham, who stood afar off from Sodom. Lot took the way that was toward Sodom. He walked in the direction of Sodom. In the eyes of God, Sodom was a wicked and sinful city (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28589" data-verses="Genesis 13:13">13:13</span>). Lot, as one of the people of God, surely knew this. He should have stayed away from Sodom and not have walked towards it. Nevertheless, because the land around Sodom was rich, Lot journeyed toward Sodom. Eventually, he moved into the city, lived there, and settled there. That was his second defeat. </p>
<p data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQdiRHrozFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B"> Do you think that God will allow His people to dwell in such a wicked city? Certainly not. Thus, under God’s sovereignty, Chedorlaomer led the attack against Sodom. God allowed that war to take place. Four kings fought against five kings. Humanly speaking, the five kings should have been victorious since their number was greater. But the four kings defeated the five kings, and the city of Sodom was taken. The Bible stresses the taking of Sodom because Lot dwelt there. This fighting was not merely a matter of four kings against five kings; it was a fighting for one of God’s people. Lot might have been peaceful as he dwelt in Sodom, but God was not peaceful. God would never allow Lot to stay there in peace. God might have said, “Lot, you may have peace within, but I will stir up some disturbance from without. I will send the four kings to defeat the five kings and capture your city. They will capture you, your family, and all that you have.” This is in fact what happened to Lot. Lot suffered defeat after defeat. Eventually, as the last step of his defeat, he fell into the hands of the enemy. He was captured, and the king of Sodom could not help him. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="QMSNPOcCBLw6v-EOydvwYEV5IvozduX4YH5_O01lRUzkJdbjHu_x8PZ2HwO74uIjb">b) Fighting for the Brother</h2><p data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7Wnrael3Z3ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo"> In the matter of the capture of Lot, God was sovereign. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28590" data-verses="Genesis 14:13">Genesis 14:13</span> says, “And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew.” The four kings had captured Sodom and all of its food supply, but one person who escaped told Abraham that Lot had been captured. Do you believe that this happened by accident? While so many others were captured, this one escaped. That person was preserved by God’s sovereignty. As we shall see, it must have happened <span class="pg" data-page-id="580" id="580">[580]</span> because of the intercession behind the scene. The one who escaped did not run away but came purposely to Abraham and told him that Lot had been captured. </p>
<p data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKQgiYn3gvCaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI"> Unlike us, Abraham did not count the weak point of his brother and did not take pleasure in Lot’s suffering and calamity. Abraham did not say, “Lot should never have separated himself from me. I knew this was going to happen. He got what he deserved. I believe that God is sovereign and that Lot’s suffering comes from God. Be at peace and go home. God will preserve Lot.” I believe that many of us would have responded in this way. But Abraham was different. When he received this information, he made a strong decision to fight for Lot (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28591" data-verses="Genesis 14:14">14:14</span>). As we shall see, Abraham prayed. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28592" data-verses="Genesis 14:22">verse 22</span> he told the king of Sodom that before he went out to war he lifted up his hand to God. How could Abraham have prayed and made such a decision? It must have been due to the fact that someone behind the scene was interceding for him. I believe that the intercessor knew of the fighting that was going on and of the capture of Lot. As a result of this intercession, Abraham made a brief and bold decision. </p>
<p data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnDn481SfEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB"> Abraham decided to take his three hundred eighteen men and fight against the four kings and their armies. The four kings must have had several armies, the number of men in which must have been much greater than the number of Abraham’s men. How could Abraham have fought against them with such a small number? Moreover, they were kings and generals who had fought many battles, and Abraham was a layman. How could he fight against those who were experts in war? How could he defeat them with such a small number? Nevertheless, Abraham was bold, having confidence in God. </p>

Everything that we have seen of Abraham’s experience of God thus far has been outward. Abraham was called by God and he answered God’s calling by going to the place where God intended him to be. That was absolutely outward. Following that, Abraham’s second experience was living by faith and trusting in God for his living. </p>
<p data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8AfonztgdnauM-Qc1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq"> The first trial that he faced in living by faith was a grievous famine through which he learned to trust God in the matter of eating. Whether in ancient or in modern times, whether in the Orient or in the West, all people, regardless of their attainment, education, or position, are concerned about the matter of making a living. Making a living is completely dependent on eating, on bread and butter. In the Bible and in human history, many times God exercised His control over the human race through this matter of eating. Do not be proud, for once God removes your food supply, you will bow down and say, “O God, help me!” </p>
<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6uWf5lpJWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> We have seen in previous messages that after Abraham came to the place where God wanted him to be, the first lesson he had to learn was to trust God in the matter of eating. He failed this test and went down to Egypt. There, in Egypt, he learned the lesson of trusting in God. After learning that lesson, he returned to the place between Bethel and Ai. Immediately after that, there followed another lesson in the same realm, in the realm of eating, when there was strife between the herdsmen of Lot and the herdsmen of Abraham. These herdsmen were fighting for their bread and butter, <span class="pg" data-page-id="590" id="590">[590]</span> striving with one another for the sake of a better living. They did not want others to take away their bread and butter. Abraham was victorious in the second trial, having learned in the first trial that God was sovereign in his daily life. Abraham came to know that the God who had called him was the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth. He did not need to take care of his own bread and butter, for he had learned that the One who had called him would take care of this for him. </p>
<p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWjz9y4v_gfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> The fighting between the four kings and the five kings was also related to bread and butter. According to history, all of the warfare among the human race is over this matter. All international warfare is for one purpose—bread and butter. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28618" data-verses="Genesis 14:11">Genesis 14:11</span> indicates that the fighting between the four kings and the five kings was for this purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXkVvpgPS0wrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip"> Abraham was not afraid of those four kings but went out boldly and fought against them, slaughtering them and recovering the food supply. After Abraham had gained the victory over the four kings, Melchisedec came to meet him with bread and wine (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28619" data-verses="Genesis 14:18">14:18</span>). This bread was mysterious. There was no need for Abraham to do anything in order to get it and he did not have to fight for it. Abraham just fought the battle and recovered the food supply, and then Melchisedec came to him with bread. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROmKTlTljeOlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX"> All of Abraham’s experiences up to the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28620" data-verses="Genesis 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> were outward, being concerned with outward blessing, care, and supply. When Abraham went down to Egypt, God took care of him outwardly, giving him cattle and servants. The victory that he won against the four kings was also outward. Even what Melchisedec brought to Abraham was outward. Everything that Abraham had experienced to that point was outward. Before hearing this, you might have thought that at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28621" data-verses="Genesis 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> Abraham must have been on the peak of his experience of God. Yes, in a sense he was on the peak, but it was the peak of the elementary stage of his experience. All that Abraham had experienced prior to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28622" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> was elementary. At the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28623" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>, God came in to turn him to an advanced stage in experiencing God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="591" id="591">[591]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9BmLdhLAG6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr">c. Knowing Grace for the Fulfillment of God’s Purpose</h2><p data-content-id="FyrUURSenH7AUUlr0ndgcvMQHmHevlth22OadvBKOnc_QUvWSaFJlMIPAfMT2Bdu2"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28624" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">Genesis 15:1</span> says, “After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.” When God came in to speak these words, Abraham was still in an elementary stage. After his slaughter of the kings, a strong enmity had been created between him and the people who belonged to those kings. When Abraham was fighting the battle against the enemy, he was bold and brave. But after gaining the victory and going home he might have said to himself, “What have I done? Those people might come back. What should I do then? I only have three hundred and eighteen men, and they have many more than that.” Abraham began to be afraid. Many times we are the same as Abraham. When we are in faith, we are bold, saying, “Hallelujah to the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth. I have lifted up my hand to Him.” After gaining the victory and shouting hallelujahs in the meetings, you go home and begin to consider, saying to yourself, “What have I done? What shall I do if the enemy returns?” </p>
<p data-content-id="CAIiqFyjjgw0LbNxWLi5D84P-w2icXq_WajUO0fMiI1qsIetqtq6bkTvknnO7bFYb"> When God appeared to Abraham in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28625" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">15:1</span>, He said, “Fear not.” God’s saying this to Abraham indicates that Abraham was fearing his enemies. God seemed to be telling him, “Abraham, you don’t need to fear. I am your shield. Be at peace. I am also your exceeding great reward.” Abraham, still being in an elementary stage at the time, was concerned about two things: that his enemies might return to fight against him and that he still had no child of his own. Abraham might have said, “Look at me—I am old. Look at my wife—she is nearly out of function. We still don’t have a child. Lord, don’t You know we are getting old in years? When will You give us a child?” When God appeared to him, Abraham was concerned about these two things. </p>
<p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KaYzxnRfDe1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> In the presence of God we cannot hide our intention. If we are given the opportunity, we shall sooner or later utter whatever is in our heart. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28626" data-verses="Genesis 15:2">15:2</span> Abraham said, “Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the son of possession of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?” <span class="pg" data-page-id="592" id="592">[592]</span> (Heb.). The next word that Abraham spoke to the Lord was not very polite. He said, “Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, a son of my house is mine heir” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28627" data-verses="Genesis 15:3">15:3</span>, Heb.). Abraham seemed to be saying, “Lord, I go childless because You have never given me a child. You must bear the blame for this. Why do I go childless? Because You have never given me a child! Now You come to tell me that You are my great reward. What’s the use of Your giving me a reward if I have no child?” </p>
<p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_TQE1Da1gjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> Abraham told the Lord that a son of his house, who was Eliezer of Damascus, would be his heir. In Darby’s New Translation the footnote says that “a son of my house” means “one of his domestics.” This indicates that Eliezer must have come from Damascus. It might have been that when Abraham was passing through Damascus he obtained him there. None of us has ever answered God’s call in a clean-cut way; we all dragged our feet through mud and water. Abraham even suffered two deaths, the death of his elder brother, Haran, and his father, Terah. Eventually, Abraham answered God’s calling, being unable to avoid it any longer. He left Haran, where he had been called the second time, taking Lot along with him, and passed through Damascus where he picked up Eliezer. When the Lord appeared to Abraham, saying that He was Abraham’s shield and great reward, Abraham seemed to say in reply, “Lord God, I go childless because You have not given me a child. The one whom I intend to have as the heir and possessor of my house must be my domestic servant, Eliezer.” </p>

<p data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XQ6pbdovkw1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW"> In the last message we saw that whatever Abraham experienced prior to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28678" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">Genesis 15</span> was a matter of God’s blessing for his existence. But God’s calling of Abraham was not merely that Abraham should exist; it was that God’s eternal purpose might be fulfilled through him. Beginning with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28679" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>, God came in to show Abraham that he needed grace for the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose. Abraham not only needed outward blessings in his environment but also grace in his life. If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28680" data-verses="Genesis 15:1-22">Genesis 15 through 22</span> carefully, we shall see that in these chapters God was dealing with Abraham in order to bring him to the realization that he needed His grace in order to fulfill His eternal purpose. So God came in not simply to bless Abraham outwardly but to work Himself into him as grace in order that Abraham might have something substantial for the carrying out of God’s eternal purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="LD01-v3um3NuLShGttlVir2GnXPsRg9jsTHcyuTXlEDKbBHncuqREEkOSwGaFv9xn"> As we saw in the previous message, two things were needed for Abraham to fulfill God’s purpose—the seed and the land. If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28681" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">Genesis 15</span> again, you will see that these two things, the seed and the land, are mentioned repeatedly. We have seen that both the seed and the land are Christ. Firstly, the seed is the individual, personal Christ, and eventually it is the corporate Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28682" data-verses="Galatians 3:16">Galatians 3:16</span> reveals that Christ is the seed of Abraham. Initially the seed was the individual Christ, but ultimately it has become the corporate Christ—the Christ who is the Head with all of us as His Body. This is the seed that is needed for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. <span class="pg" data-page-id="604" id="604">[604]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD0W-N0DvfiWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP"> Christ is also the land. The concept that Christ is the land may seem rather new or strange because in the past many of us were told that the good land of Canaan was a type, a symbol, of heaven. This concept is held by many Christians, but if we return to the pure Word, we can see that the land actually symbolizes Christ. In type, the land is the place where God’s people have rest and where God can defeat all of His enemies and establish His kingdom with His habitation for His expression and representation. Please remember the following points regarding the land: that it is the place where God’s people may have rest; that it is the place where all of God’s enemies can be slaughtered; and that it is the place where God establishes His kingdom and builds up His habitation that He may be expressed and represented on this rebellious earth. What is qualified to be such a land? Nothing other than Christ. In Christ, we have rest and we slaughter the enemies. In Christ, God establishes His kingdom and builds His habitation, the church, for His expression and representation. Have you seen that both the seed and the land are Christ? The seed that God promised Abraham is today the corporate Christ, and the land that God promised him is the wonderful resurrected and elevated Christ in whom we rest and slaughter our enemies and in whom God establishes His kingdom and builds up His habitation that He might be expressed and represented. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROmKThTn32OlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX"> When God promised Abraham that he would have a seed, Abraham believed God for this immediately (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28683" data-verses="Genesis 15:6">15:6</span>). When Abraham believed in God for the promise concerning the seed, his faith, which was so precious to God, was counted as righteousness to him by God. At that time, Abraham was justified by faith, by the faith that believed that God would give him the seed to accomplish God’s eternal purpose. When Abraham believed in God for that, God was happy with him. After this, however, when God also promised Abraham that He would give him the land, Abraham fell short, saying to the Lord, “Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28684" data-verses="Genesis 15:8">v. 8</span>). Although he was able to believe in God for the promise concerning the seed, he could not believe in Him for the promise concerning the land. <span class="pg" data-page-id="605" id="605">[605]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9BmLZhJEq6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr"> The principle is the same today. To believe that Christ is the seed is easy, but to believe that Christ is the land is difficult. It is easier to believe that Christ is our life than it is to believe that Christ can be our church life. Many Christians believe in God for Christ’s being their life, but when they come to the matter of the church life, the good land where we can rest, slaughter the enemies, and afford God the ground to establish His kingdom and build up His habitation, they say that it is impossible for us to have this today. Many Christians seem to be saying, “It is possible for us to live by Christ, but it is impossible to have the church life.” It is easier for them to believe that Christ can be their life than that the church can be their living. They cannot believe that it is possible to have the church life today. Once again we see that we are the same as Abraham, finding it easy to believe in God for the seed but finding it difficult to believe in Him for the land. Do you have Christ as the seed? Do you also have Him as the land? It is not such a simple matter to have Christ as the land for us to live in so that we may have the church life and that God may have His kingdom with His habitation for His expression and representation. </p>
<p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQboUlrmRUHTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> Years ago, before we came into the church life, we ministered on the matter of living by Christ, but we ourselves were not in the rest. We wandered restlessly until one day, by His grace, we came into the church. When we came into the church, we began to have the sensation that we were in the rest. Before we came into the church life, it was very difficult for us to slaughter the enemies, but after coming into the church life, we found that it was easy to slaughter them all. In the church life God’s kingdom is set up, His habitation is built up, and God is expressed and represented. This is the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose today. </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYgxpMseQW5oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa">(3) God Confirming His Promise by Making a Covenant<br/>with Abraham through Christ</h2><p data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0ZKTBYoSconn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF"> Because Abraham found it difficult to believe in God regarding the promise of the land, God was forced to make a covenant with him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28685" data-verses="Genesis 15:9-21">15:9-21</span> we see that God confirmed His promise by making a covenant with Abraham through Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="606" id="606">[606]</span> The way in which God made this covenant with Abraham was very peculiar. This portion of the Word is difficult for people to understand. We need to see that God was forced to make this covenant with Abraham. As far as God was concerned, there was no need for Him to do this. If Abraham had immediately believed in God for the promise of the land, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28686" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">Genesis 15</span> would have been much shorter than it is now. There would have been no need for many things that are mentioned there: the dividing of the heifer, the she-goat, and the ram; the offering of the turtledove and the young pigeon; the deep sleep that fell upon Abraham; the horror of great darkness that came upon him; God’s passing through the pieces as a smoking furnace and as a torch of fire; and the mention of the four hundred years. It seems that nothing was pleasant. It was not the time of sunrise but of sunset, and God did not come in a lovely way but as a smoking furnace and a flaming torch. If we had witnessed such a scene, we probably would have been frightened to death, being unable to withstand it and finding it altogether a terrifying thing. This scene, however, has a very sweet flavor because in it God made a covenant with His dear called one; He had no intention of terrifying him. </p>
<p data-content-id="YWQf39oOaKT-w18LKhlsjotUn8kIDjHh52RJBmzJk0PH2LSkAzFUEZelzC01-ioTH"> I have spent much time in trying to understand this portion of the Word. In the early days I could not understand it because I lacked experience. I looked into some books, but none of them said anything helpful about this matter. But eventually by experiences through the years the Lord has shown me the real significance of this portion of the Word. This incident in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28687" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">Genesis 15</span> is the consummation of a covenant, the record of God’s enacting of a covenant. The first covenant that God made was with Noah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28688" data-verses="Genesis 9:8-17">9:8-17</span>), a covenant that had a rainbow as its sign. Here, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28689" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">Genesis 15</span>, is the second covenant made by God with man. We need to keep this fact firmly in mind. </p>

<p data-content-id="vGPkFtfe7Aen3iGIVhF4Dd2_r5BhJoSKHjShQRi-Q6TFheMiOa11sXw6WrcmFYS61"> Genesis is a book of the riches of God’s divine revelation. The more I stay with this book, the more I enjoy its sweet riches. When we read the book of Genesis, we need the divine enlightenment, for by our human mentality we cannot get anything out of this book except historical records and some interesting stories. When I was young, I was happy to hear the stories in this book, but if we only understand Genesis as a story book, we shall miss a great deal. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3OhlPf2Y8rDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12">3) The Allegory of the Two Women</h2><p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQJlj6eypG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> Sarah and Hagar, the wife and the concubine of Abraham, God’s called one, are an allegory of two covenants (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28741" data-verses="Galatians 4:24">Gal. 4:24</span>). If the apostle Paul had not written the book of Galatians in which he tells us that these two women are an allegory of two covenants, none of us would ever have dreamed of such a thing. Although some Christians criticize the allegorization of the Bible, Paul took the lead to allegorize the Old Testament. If we are going to appreciate the treasures in the book of Genesis, we must realize that Genesis is a book of allegories. Abraham’s biography is an allegory. His wife and his concubine especially are a very meaningful allegory. In this message we shall do our best to probe into the meaning of this allegory. </p>
<p data-content-id="uMdoZ7sIrphDxIxrKnqKneeVCPpqZxYYQWIgd4x9rSnaU9KtTeicgVo8QagD4QHNt"> Before we come to this allegory, however, we need to see something about the book of Genesis. Why is Genesis so sweet and precious? Because it is a book containing many seeds of the divine revelation that were sown by God Himself. This book contains all of the main aspects of God’s divine <span class="pg" data-page-id="616" id="616">[616]</span> revelation. In the very first chapter we see that God has an intention to express Himself through man and that for this purpose He created man in His own image (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28742" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">1:26</span>). Man was made according to God’s image with the intention that he might become God’s exact expression and that through this expression God might have a dominion, a kingdom, in which He could exercise His authority. This is God’s ultimate intention, His eternal purpose. If you read the Bible with this heavenly light, you will see that the whole Bible covers this divine intention. In order for God to fulfill His intention of having Himself expressed and of obtaining a dominion on earth, He needs to have the seed and the land, both of which are related to Christ. This Christ must be wrought into God’s people. God wanted to do this with Adam, but Adam failed. Eventually, God had a new start with a new race, the race of the called ones, the first one of which was Abraham. If you read Abraham’s biography, you will see that again and again God came to him with a promise concerning two things—the seed and the land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28743" data-verses="Genesis 12:7">12:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28744" data-verses="Genesis 13:15-16">13:15-16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28745" data-verses="Genesis 15:5">15:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28746" data-verses="Genesis 15:7">7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28747" data-verses="Genesis 15:18">18</span>). Abraham was not young when he was first called by God; he was seventy-five years of age when he answered God’s calling in a full way. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnmXN4K4svQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM"> Although Abraham was seventy-five years of age, he still did not have a child. As far as God was concerned, that was very good. If when God calls you, you have nothing, that is very good, for if you have too much, that will frustrate God’s calling. When Abraham was called by God, he did not have a child and he lived in a condemned, demonic land, a land out of which God called him. After he was called, Abraham had no child and no land. Suppose a man and his wife today would have no child and no land. Would they not think of themselves as the most pitiful people on earth? Perhaps Abraham said to his wife, “What are we here for? I am seventy-five and you are sixty-five, and we don’t have even one child. We have also been called out of our land. Where are we? What are we doing here? Where are we going?” It seems that they were in a pitiful situation. But the more pitiful we are in this way, the better it is for God’s purpose. I hope that none of us has a child within nor a land without. If both within and without we have nothing, that would be wonderful. Why? Because God <span class="pg" data-page-id="617" id="617">[617]</span> does not want us to have anything for the fulfillment of His purpose. What God wants is to work Christ into us as the seed and then to work Christ out of us as the land. Firstly, the seed must be wrought into us; secondly, it must be worked out of us to become the land. Both the seed and the land are Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3OhlPf2ZIDDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12"> We have seen that Abraham answered God’s calling in the way of dragging his feet through mud and water. Since God did not give Abraham a child, Abraham took Lot, his nephew, along with him. Abraham could not say that he had nothing, because he had taken Lot with him. Furthermore, it might have been that as he was traveling through Damascus, he found Eliezer and took him along with him. Following that, it might have been that after Abraham fell into Egypt, drifting downstream like a piece of driftwood, he acquired Hagar. Although he planned to sacrifice his wife in Egypt, under God’s sovereignty his wife was preserved, and, according to God’s good plan, Abraham acquired many riches, including an Egyptian maid named Hagar. In Haran Abraham picked up Lot, in Damascus he found Eliezer, and in Egypt he secured Hagar. But in the good land he did not gain anything. All he obtained in the good land was God’s promise in plain words regarding the seed and the land. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQJlj6fWFG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> Although Abraham was not free to argue with God, within himself he probably said to God, “God, You don’t need to promise me over and over again that You will give me a boy. You already told me that my descendants will become a great nation. You have told me three times that I would have a seed, but why don’t You do anything? God, don’t You realize that one action is better than a thousand words? You’ve not only made a promise to me but also a covenant. You tell me that the rain is going to come, but I have not yet seen even one drop of water. Also, You told me that You would give me this land. Why don’t You give it to me right now? You always say, ‘I will give it to you,’ but don’t You know that I need it now?” This was a real testing to Abraham. Firstly, Abraham relied upon Lot. Eventually Lot became a problem to him and separated from him. After that, Abraham put his trust in Eliezer, telling God that Eliezer would be his heir. When God said that Eliezer would not be the heir, Abraham might have said, <span class="pg" data-page-id="618" id="618">[618]</span> “God, what are You doing? You have just robbed me. You say no to this and no to that. You don’t give me even one yes.” In order to strengthen Abraham’s faith, God made a covenant with him in a very extraordinary way, using three cattle and two living birds. That covenant made by God was much stronger than just His promise. </p>

<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qcGFIw7JdzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S">4) God’s Covenant Confirmed</h2><p data-content-id="aGZQhn44RfDLbiYsGGvVETI0VqaHKCGvuVmdAiPygWOGRgcCG0VL2WETay77K2O7o"> In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28781" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Genesis 17</span>, a record of God’s crucial dealing with Abraham in confirming His covenant. We have seen that Abraham was called and that he received God’s call, promise, and covenant. After God called Abraham, He gave him the promise and then He confirmed the promise by making a covenant with him. After Abraham received the covenant, he accepted his wife’s proposal to exercise his flesh along with the expediency of Hagar to produce a seed. The result was Ishmael. Here we see three things: Sarah’s proposal, Hagar’s expediency, and Abraham’s exercise of the flesh to produce Ishmael. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="bdPZiOYGTI0GDMWc0r7m5Qv4NH6ZCY4FzwTm0_1hM378LkILri-YBA6MHtvxUHmDQ">a) God’s Disappearing for Thirteen Years<br/>Because of Abraham’s Exercise of the Flesh</h2><p data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIIT_aGyX3D0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs"> Abraham might have thought that it was not serious for him to exercise his flesh to produce Ishmael, but according to God’s economy for His eternal purpose, it was very serious. If we compare the first verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28782" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> with the last verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28783" data-verses="Genesis 16:16">chapter sixteen</span>, we can see that between these two chapters there was a period of thirteen years and that there was no record of Abraham’s life during those thirteen years. When Abraham brought forth Ishmael, he was eighty-six years of age, and thirteen years later, when he was ninety-nine, God appeared to him again. During that long period of thirteen years, Abraham, a man called by God, a man who <span class="pg" data-page-id="628" id="628">[628]</span> was living by faith and who was learning to know grace for the fulfillment of God’s purpose, missed God’s presence. How serious it is not to have God’s presence! </p>
<p data-content-id="yObOo7LOjjFarxWXeCIo4NQ0-U-nfP03Kiwq9oNdUXzgDgrb2yrYAyxlelIIkT9lp"> After Abraham had answered God’s calling and had begun to live a life by faith in God for his existence, he had a failure. Being short of faith, he went down to Egypt where he was even planning to sacrifice his wife. According to the human concept, that was much worse than using Hagar to produce Ishmael. But if we read these chapters attentively, we shall see that God was not as displeased with Abraham’s going down to Egypt as He was with his using Hagar to produce Ishmael. Of course, it was not good for Abraham to go down to Egypt, but that did not offend God as much as his exercise of the flesh to bring forth Ishmael. Going down to Egypt was a failure without, but taking Hagar to produce Ishmael was failure within. It was deeper, for it was not merely related to circumstances but to life. Taking Hagar to produce Ishmael was not simply a matter of right or wrong or of committing a sin; it was a matter of life. Nothing that we do by ourselves is life. Whatever we work by ourselves is not life. Life is God Himself. It is God being something to us in our very being. We should not do anything by ourselves but by God’s being wrought into us. Whatever we do by ourselves is not life but death, for it is the issue of our natural self. </p>
<p data-content-id="e4Tu7RSEEn956Bu43KIdFttNenExLhbqE99G8qhMhliWdoAMPEcx2IgxrawDytCgr"> In the eyes of God, our natural self is more dirty and more defiling than sin. Although sin is unclean in the presence of God, it is not as offensive to God as our natural self is. While we all recognize the seriousness of sin, not many people realize the seriousness of our natural self. If we commit a sin, we would immediately confess it to God, but if we do certain good things by our natural self, we do not have the sense that we are offending God. If I hate a particular brother, it is easy for me to recognize that this hatred is a sin and confess it as such to God. But if I love this brother by my natural self, it would be difficult to realize that this is against God. Sin only offends God’s righteousness, but our natural self offends God Himself. God wants to come into us to be our life and our everything that we may live, work, and do everything by Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="629" id="629">[629]</span> But when we do things by our self, our natural self, we put Him aside. By this we can see that the natural self is against God Himself. It is not only against God’s righteousness or holiness but against God Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_LUPWUOBYw3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj"> God’s intention with Abraham was that He would work Himself into Abraham so that Abraham might bring forth a child to fulfill God’s purpose. God did not intend that Abraham do this by his natural strength. Nevertheless, Abraham used his natural strength to bring forth a child to fulfill God’s purpose. Nothing offends God more than this kind of natural doing. Working by our natural self is the most offensive thing to God. To Abraham, it was not so serious for him to take Hagar. His wife, Sarah, even proposed this, thinking that it would help Abraham to produce the seed since Abraham was old and she was out of function. But God had promised that they would have a son. Since they did not know how this could come about, they took the expediency of using Hagar, the Egyptian maid, to produce a child, not realizing how offensive that was to God. It was an insult to Him. Therefore, God disappeared from His dear called one for thirteen years. It was as if God had turned His face away from Abraham and had refused to speak to him for that length of time. There is no record in the Bible of what happened during that period of time. We only know from the last verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28784" data-verses="Genesis 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> and the first verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28785" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> that God reappeared to Abraham thirteen years later. According to the Bible record, thirteen years of Abraham’s life were wasted. In the heavenly record those years were lost because Abraham exercised his natural self to do something for the fulfilling of God’s purpose. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="NgrUOPst9ndCGqPDKS1sPHsu5DPRKLEkyN_8bfWBSPyO-5g1-dnym0-8I86wUsKBc">b) Perfection Required by God’s All-sufficiency</h2><p data-content-id="topU0NZPOs7b25ters3Gd4GBK2iJhSqSpV5hz_XoXr_MU93J_kJdBBom0evJv9lGi"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28786" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Genesis 17:1</span> says, “And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the all-sufficient God; walk before me, and be thou perfect” (Heb.). Here we see that God charged Abraham with two things—that Abraham had to walk before the all-sufficient God and that he had to be perfect. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28787" data-verses="Genesis 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>, Abraham did not walk before God; he walked before Sarah, Hagar, <span class="pg" data-page-id="630" id="630">[630]</span> and Ishmael. Since he had not walked before God, God came and told him to walk before Him and to be perfect. God’s telling Abraham to be perfect indicates that before that time he was not perfect. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28788" data-verses="Genesis 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>, Abraham was imperfect; he lacked something. </p>
<p data-content-id="h08U91ltZnqTUI0aV0g56my-iI86Cw-cZTKHrVo12qTwS3OgmpjHqkUk9BKO83GId"> Before we consider further what it means to walk before God and to be perfect, we need to learn the meaning of the title of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28789" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">17:1</span>, the all-sufficient God. In Hebrew this title is El-Shaddai. El means the Strong One, the Mighty One, and Shaddai, implying the meaning of breast, udder, means all-sufficient. El-Shaddai is the Mighty One with an udder, the Mighty One who has the all-sufficient supply. An udder produces milk, and milk is the all-sufficient supply, having water, minerals, and many vitamins in it and containing all that we need for our daily living. So El-Shaddai means the all-sufficient Mighty One. </p>
<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWJxjBEoKtXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> When Abraham did things by his natural self, he forgot the source of his supply. In other words, he forgot God as his all-sufficient source of supply. Therefore, God came to Abraham and seemed to say, “I am the Mighty One with an udder. Are you lacking something? Why don’t you come to this udder? Are you hungry or thirsty? Come to this udder. The source of your supply is not your natural self, but I, the Mighty One with an udder. I am the all-sufficient One who can supply everything you need for your living and everything you need for the fulfillment of My eternal purpose. I am the source. You are not the source. You should not live on your own or by yourself. You have to live by Me as the source of your supply.” </p>

<p data-content-id="x52sBK0RPP8CO8qDhR2srqP2tm0q0DNKTmsXdJCAVgGjfw6s5s9H5KtPnduIvZkRU"> If we are to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28833" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Genesis 17</span>, we must know what God’s purpose is. God’s purpose, which He made in eternity past, is to express Himself through a body of people on earth. In order to have a collective people as His expression, God created the universe and within the universe, as its center, He created man in His image with the intention that man would express Him and represent Him so that He may have a dominion on earth as His kingdom. This was God’s purpose with Adam and with the children of Israel in the past, it is His purpose with the church today, and it shall be His purpose in the millennium and throughout eternity. Throughout all the ages, God’s purpose has remained the same: to have Himself expressed and represented by man on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2Nh-ImmViDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> For the fulfillment of His purpose, God needs a people. If God can gain a people, He will be able to accomplish His purpose, but if He cannot gain a people, He will be defeated. But our God cannot be defeated! God created Adam, and Adam became a failure. Then God called Abraham to be the head of a new race. Although God called only one person, Abraham, this person had to become a race so that God could be expressed and represented on earth. God called Abraham for this purpose. It is impossible for an individual to fulfill God’s purpose, for what God needs is not just an individual but a people. One Abraham must be multiplied into a great many Abrahams. But this cannot be accomplished according <span class="pg" data-page-id="644" id="644">[644]</span> to man’s natural understanding or by his natural ability, strength, or being. </p>

<p data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7Wnr2enz93ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo"> The Bible reveals that God’s way to express Himself is to work Himself into man. God’s way is extraordinary. Although God wants us to do things for Him, His desire is not that we do anything but that He come into us to do everything through us for Himself. His desire is to work Himself into us, making Him one with us and us one with Him. But no one is willing for God to do this. Everyone seems to say, “O Lord, if You ask me to do something, I’ll do it for You, but I cannot bear to have You come into me to annul me and dethrone me. When I do something for You, I like to do it by myself.” Nevertheless, God would say, “Before you do anything for Me, I must work Myself into you. By coming into you, I will have you crucified and then I will make you alive by, with, and for Me. Are you willing for this?” Abraham did not wait for God to do this, but, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28834" data-verses="Genesis 16:1">Genesis 16</span> reveals, he acted on his own to bring forth a seed. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjJ9sH8TpcGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD">b) The Unveiling of the Divine Title</h2><p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qcG5Ix_ldzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28835" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">17:1</span> God came in to unveil His divine title, unveiling what He, the very God, is. To unveil a name is to unveil a person, for a name always represents a person. Since God’s divine title denotes His divine Person, the unveiling of the divine title is actually the revelation of the divine Person. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28836" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">1:1</span> God was unveiled as Elohim, which primarily means the Mighty One, the Strong One, and which is mainly related to God’s creation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28837" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> God was revealed as Jehovah, the great I Am. The name Jehovah means “I Am that I Am,” implying that God is the self-existent and ever-existing One. This title of Jehovah refers to God’s relationship with man. Furthermore, God revealed to Abraham that He was the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28838" data-verses="Genesis 14:22">14:22</span>). This is mainly related to God’s care for His people’s existence. But <span class="pg" data-page-id="645" id="645">[645]</span> now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28839" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">chapter seventeen</span>, God comes in to unveil Himself further, revealing Himself to Abraham as El-Shaddai, the all-sufficient Mighty One with an udder. </p>
<p data-content-id="aGZQhn44RfDLbiYsGGvVETIIVrunKCGvuVmdAiPygWOGRgcCG0VL2WETay77K2O7o"> God’s all-sufficiency is in His divine udder. Perhaps some readers are unhappy with the use of the word udder and prefer that we use the word breast. However, if we were to use the word breast, most people would associate it with the matter of love. But the divine title in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28840" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">17:1</span> denotes that God is the rich source of supply as grace to His people for them to fulfill His purpose. Although He wants us to fulfill His purpose, He does not need anything from us. He wants to be our supply. Our God has an all-sufficient source of supply, and this source is likened to an udder. This is the meaning implied in the title El-Shaddai. Everything that is supplied to us from the udder of a cow comes into us and even becomes our constituent. All of the elements and ingredients of the riches of the milk we drink become our constituent, our organic tissue. It seemed that God was saying to Abraham, “You have known Me as the Most High God. Although that is wonderful, it is no longer adequate. I am not only the Most High God to you objectively, but I want to be the divine milk to you subjectively. I must be the One that you drink into your being.” </p>
<p data-content-id="bdPZiOYGTI0GDMWc0r7m5QvENGe9CY4FzwTm0_1hM378LkILri-YBA6MHtvxUHmDQ"> Our mind may be bothered at the thought of such a divine drinking. The first time that I gave a message on the eating of Jesus was in 1958. After that message, a very highly educated brother said to me, “Brother Lee, that message was very good, but the term ‘eating Jesus’ is too wild.” I replied, “Brother, I am not the first one to use this term. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28841" data-verses="John 6:35">John 6:35</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28842" data-verses="John 6:57">57</span> the Lord Jesus said, ‘I am the bread of life’ and ‘He who eats Me shall also live because of Me.’” Are you troubled by the likening of God’s rich breast to the udder of a cow? Although I would prefer to liken God to a nice, tender, gentle mother with a loving breast, it is more meaningful to liken God to a cow with a rich udder, as the Scripture implies. We all have been positioned under this divine udder. </p>
<p data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIIT_mGwDPD0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs"> Many verses in the Bible give us the ground to speak of God in this way. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28843" data-verses="Exodus 3:8">Exodus 3:8</span> says, “I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up <span class="pg" data-page-id="646" id="646">[646]</span> out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.” The good land is a type of the all-inclusive Christ. With this Christ there is the flowing of milk. Before the children of Israel came into the good land to drink of the milk, they drank of the water that flowed from the riven rock which also was Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28844" data-verses="Exodus 17:6">Exo. 17:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28845" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:4">1 Cor. 10:4</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28846" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span> we see that in the New Jerusalem there will be a river flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb. If we put all of these verses together, we can see that our God today is One out of whom something is flowing to quench, supply, and satisfy us. Regardless of whether we call it milk or living water, it flows out of God’s being to supply us. Hence, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28847" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">1 Corinthians 12:13</span> says that we have all been made to drink of one Spirit, who is God Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28848" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span>). When we are drinking of the Spirit, we are drinking of God. Our God is so rich that one type or symbol cannot give us a complete understanding of Him, so the Bible uses different types and symbols to reveal the various aspects of His riches. The milk and the living water both reveal how rich God is to us. The principle in each case is the same: that the riches of His divine being are flowing out to be our supply as grace to us for us to fulfill His purpose. We all must drink of the rich supply that flows out from our God that we may be able to fulfill the divine purpose. </p>

<p data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYgxp8sfU65oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa"> In the book of Genesis, nearly all the divine truths are sown as seeds. In this message we come to a great and basic truth in the holy Word that is sown as a seed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28861" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Genesis 17</span>—circumcision. </p>
<p data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0ZKTxYpm8onn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF"> In order to understand circumcision, we need to see two main points of the divine revelation unfolded in the Bible. The first is that God’s eternal purpose is to have Himself expressed and represented by man on earth. This matter is revealed throughout the whole Bible, from the first chapter of Genesis through the last chapter of Revelation. The second point concerns God’s way of accomplishing His purpose. God’s way to fulfill His purpose is to work Himself into man as man’s life and everything so that man may become His expression and representation. The accomplishment of God’s purpose does not depend upon what we can do but upon God’s working Himself into us. If we see these two points, then we can understand the basic truths in the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="YWQf39oOaKT-w18LKhlsjotkn9AsDjHh52RJBmzJk0PH2LSkAzFUEZelzC01-ioTH"> For the fulfillment of His divine purpose, God called Abraham out of Chaldea, a land of demons and idolatry. As we have seen, Abraham did not give a clear-cut answer to God’s call but dragged his feet through mud and water. His father brought him to Haran, the half-way place. By God’s mercy, Abraham answered God’s call nearly in a full way at Haran, crossed the great river, and came to the very place where God wanted him to be. That place was close to the sinful city of Sodom. It was not easy for Abraham to remain in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="654" id="654">[654]</span> place where God wanted him to be and not long afterward he drifted down to Egypt. But by God’s sovereignty, Abraham, who had left demonic Chaldea, had forsaken halfway Haran, and had overcome sinful Sodom, was delivered out of worldly Egypt and was brought back to the place of God’s choosing. </p>
<p data-content-id="E-xv1nlZl2LrnNkDtbmzOeoWdsG6tUIFb3C0mvDz1LtjokSWkphwKc-Ng-yoBiibt"> We need to recall the names of three very important persons related to Abraham—Lot, Eliezer, and Hagar. Abraham took Lot with him when he left Haran, and he probably acquired Eliezer at Damascus and Hagar in Egypt. None of these three was a help to Abraham; each one was a problem. God rejected all three of these persons. Abraham used his natural strength to coordinate with Hagar to produce his masterpiece—Ishmael. But Ishmael was absolutely rejected by God. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2ziqOa0hY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df">6) Circumcision for the Fulfillment of God’s Purpose</h2><p data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8AfonztgdnuuNK4c1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq"> With this as the background, we come now to the matter of circumcision (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28862" data-verses="Genesis 17:9-14">17:9-14</span>). At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28863" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Genesis 17</span>, Abraham had been robbed of all the places where he had been and of all the important persons he had acquired. Chaldea and Haran were past, and he had nothing to do with Egypt. Although he was in the land that God had promised to give him, it had not yet been given to him. Thus, Abraham did not have Chaldea, Haran, Egypt, Sodom, or a portion of the promised land. Furthermore, Lot had separated from him, and both Eliezer and Ishmael had been rejected by God. Abraham was left alone with Sarah. They were two old people who had gained nothing and who were able to do nothing. Perhaps Abraham looked at Sarah and said, “What shall we do? We don’t have anything and we can’t do anything.” At that juncture God came in, revealing Himself to Abraham as El-Shaddai, the all-sufficient Mighty One. It was then that God told Abraham that his name had to be changed from Abram to Abraham and that his wife’s name had to be changed from Sarai to Sarah. After that, God told Abraham that he had to be circumcised. Abraham had been robbed of every place and every person. The only thing that still remained with him was himself. God came in to deal with Abraham’s self, with <span class="pg" data-page-id="655" id="655">[655]</span> his flesh, natural strength, and natural ability. This self, the flesh and natural strength, had to be cut off, circumcised. If we had been Abraham, we probably would have said, “God, don’t You know that You have robbed me of so much? There is no one like me on the whole earth. Everyone else has a place of his own, but I have nothing. What will You do now—get rid of me?” God might have answered, “Abraham, you are right. I have robbed you of Chaldea, Haran, Egypt, Lot, Eliezer, Hagar, and Ishmael. I will not rob you anymore, but I will cut you. What you have acquired has been taken from you, and what you are must now be cut.” This is circumcision. </p>
<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6uWr5kNlWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> Why is there the need of circumcision? On the one hand, God needs man for the fulfillment of His purpose. On the other hand, God does not want anything of man. However, none of the called ones would say, “God, I want to be for You, but I don’t want anything of me to be for You. I am willing for You to take all that I have and terminate all that I am.” On the contrary, everyone says, “Praise the Lord that He has called me. From now on, whatever I have and whatever I am will be for Him.” Consider the example of Peter. For three and a half years the Lord told His disciples that they had to love Him and follow Him. But none of the disciples understood that the Lord did not want anything of them. When the Lord told the disciples that they all would be offended because of Him, Peter said, “If all shall be stumbled in You, I will never be stumbled,” and “Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28864" data-verses="Matthew 26:33">Matt. 26:33</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28865" data-verses="Matthew 26:35">35</span>). But the Lord told Peter, “Truly I say to you, that this night, before a cock crows, you will deny Me three times” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28866" data-verses="Matthew 26:34">Matt. 26:34</span>). The Lord seemed to be saying to Peter, “Peter, don’t boast. You have nothing to boast in. Tonight you will deny Me three times.” Peter did deny the Lord three times, and those denials were his actual and practical circumcision. The proud, self-confident Peter was cut into pieces by the circumcising knife of his denial of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWjz9G4trAfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> We all must see that although God does need us for His recovery, He does not want anything of us. It is difficult for us to realize this. We either stay away from the Lord or we come <span class="pg" data-page-id="656" id="656">[656]</span> to Him with everything that we have. A Japanese brother may say, “We Japanese are the most patient people on earth. I shall serve the Lord with my Japanese patience.” But the Lord does not need this kind of patience. Some sisters may say, “The Lord certainly needs us sisters, and we are willing to be for Him. As sisters, we are not rough like the brothers; we are quite fine. In the church life, our fineness will be for the Lord.” Sisters, it is absolutely right for you to be for the Lord, but it is absolutely wrong that anything of yourselves be for Him. Since God does not want anything of us, we all need to be circumcised. </p>
<p data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXkVvdgNWQwrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip"> The seed of circumcision was not sown in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28867" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span> or 15 but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28868" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Genesis 17</span>, after Abraham had been robbed of so much. Then God appeared to Abraham again, unveiled Himself as the all-sufficient Mighty One with an udder, and told Abraham to change his name. Abraham had to have a radical change. God seemed to say, “Abraham, you must now be circumcised. If you are not circumcised, there is no way for Me to fulfill My purpose through you. In order to have a people for My purpose, there must be the seed. Out of that seed will come the people who will possess the land wherein I shall have dominion, build My temple for My expression, and find rest. This is My purpose. But for the fulfillment of My purpose, I don’t need anything of you. I will do everything for you and be everything to you. This is why I have taken every place and everyone away from you. Now I am asking you to agree with Me and cooperate with Me to get rid of yourself. I want your flesh to be cut off, but I don’t want to do it directly. I want you to do it for Me. I want you to cut off your flesh. Are you willing to cooperate with Me?” We must not take this as a doctrinal teaching or as an exposition of the stories in the Bible. We all must realize that our need today is to have ourselves circumcised. </p>

<p data-content-id="topU0NZPOs7b25ters3Gd4WdK3mthSqSpV5hz_XoXr_MU93J_kJdBBom0evJv9lGi"> In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28899" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span>, which contains an intimate record of Abraham’s experience with God. If we take an overall view of Abraham’s experience with God as found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28900" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">chapter eleven</span> through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28901" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span>, we shall see that his experience is in four major sections. Firstly, while he was living in the demonic land of Chaldea, he was called by God. Suddenly, much to his surprise, the God of glory appeared to him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28902" data-verses="Acts 7:2">Acts 7:2</span>). That was the beginning of his experience with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="h08U91ltZnqTUI0aV0g56miiiJICCw-cZTKHrVo12qTwS3OgmpjHqkUk9BKO83GId"> Secondly, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28903" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">chapters twelve through fourteen</span>, Abraham experienced living by faith in God for his existence. He had been called by God for the fulfillment of God’s divine purpose, but, as a human being, he still had to have food, protection, and all that was necessary to maintain his existence. He was a stranger in a new land, having no property of his own. Thus, God trained him to exercise the very faith which God had infused into him to trust in God for his existence. </p>
<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWJh_BFM2tXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> Following that, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28904" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">chapters fifteen through seventeen</span>, the third section, God trained him to know grace for the fulfillment of His purpose. Here Abraham learned not to do anything by himself or on his own but to do everything by and with God. Although God needed him, God did not need anything of him. All that Abraham had, was, and could do was absolutely repudiated by God. God spent at least fifteen years to train Abraham in this matter. For thirteen years, God disappeared from him because he did not behave himself properly. Abraham was trained, disciplined, and very much in God’s favor, but he did not walk in the presence of God. Rather, he walked in the presence of his wife, the one who <span class="pg" data-page-id="666" id="666">[666]</span> proposed that he exercise his flesh to produce a seed for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. Abraham expected that Ishmael, his seed, could fulfill God’s purpose. Nevertheless, God seemed to say, “No, I don’t approve of Ishmael. He is the issue of your effort, the produce of your doing. I reject him and you must not keep him. Abram, you must learn that nothing that you can do means anything to Me. I only need you, not your ability and strength. I don’t need your Lot, Eliezer, Hagar, or anything of you. You must walk before Me, not doing anything by yourself or on your own. You must be nourished and supplied by the sufficiency of My divine udder. Then you will be able to produce something not only for Me but also of Me. I only accept and approve what is out of Myself. I shall not produce an Isaac without you. I shall produce an Isaac through you, but not out of you. You are My channel, not the source. Whenever you consider yourself to be the source, you insult Me. I am the unique, all-sufficient source. You have known Me as the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth. Now you must know Me as El-Shaddai, as the all-sufficient Mighty One with an udder. Stay under My udder and be supplied and nourished constantly by My all-sufficiency. This is the way to walk before Me.” As Abraham learned to know grace for the fulfillment of God’s purpose, God changed him in both name and in nature. God changed Abraham’s constitution by having him circumcised. Abram was terminated and Abraham came into being. This is the third major section of Abraham’s experience of God. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="MtCll2XOY8R8dFgTUXdR4bNM7V878JwNRjNJM9TIVoQfsRCA1WYTsZI35lh9oQ1PX">d. Living in Fellowship with God</h2><h2 class="head5" data-content-id="Vyv6cezndY8yrw_ApV0zPfUq7H_2JbjcYWxSSt0SaXZR8SPfWLyu4As---ucS3eoN">1) Communion with God on the Human Level</h2>
<p data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYQr8sVksNMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx"> Immediately after this, he was ushered into a glorious section—living in fellowship with God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28905" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">18:1—24:67</span>). Abraham had been called, had learned to live by faith in God for his existence, and had come to know grace for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. Now he has been brought into constant fellowship with God. The fourth section of his experience is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28906" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">chapters eighteen through twenty-four</span>. Everything revealed <span class="pg" data-page-id="667" id="667">[667]</span> in these seven chapters is an aspect of Abraham’s intimate fellowship with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZhgnrVFAp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6"> In the first section of his experience, God appeared to Abraham as the God of glory. In the second section He revealed Himself as the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth. In the third section He came to Abraham as El-Shaddai, as the all-sufficient Mighty One with an udder. In the fourth section God came in a very different way—as a mortal man. As Abraham sat in the door of his tent during the heat of the day, he saw three mortal men approaching (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28907" data-verses="Genesis 18:1-2">vv. 1-2</span>). In Hebrew, the word translated “men” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28908" data-verses="Genesis 18:2">verse 2</span> means mortal men, human beings. God appeared to Abraham in such a form. At first, Abraham did not realize that one of these men was the Lord, Jehovah, and that the other two were angels. </p>
<p data-content-id="BLE5KA_UJUWmNHemF8RznNyuercB0O1klPDPPz_cM4ETPjCdTs_KDy-6YMjsxBV2U"> Of these forms of God’s appearing—as the God of glory, as the Most High God, as El-Shaddai, and as a mortal man—which do you prefer? Do you prefer that God appear to you as the God of glory? If He did, you would be terrified. Would you like Him to come as the Most High God? If the president of the United States were to come to me and say, “I am the most high president of the United States coming to visit a little man,” I would feel uneasy. But if he were to come as a man the same as me, I would say, “Sir, how are you? Please come in and rest and be refreshed.” If he were to come in this way, revealing later that he was the president of the United States, I could have a very good time with him. Of these four ways of God’s appearing, I prefer that He come to me in the form of a mortal man, not in His divine glory, in His most high position, nor in His all-sufficiency. </p>
<p data-content-id="x52sBK0RPP8CO8qDhR2srqfWtnwO0DNKTmsXdJCAVgGjfw6s5s9H5KtPnduIvZkRU"> We all need to experience our God to such an extent. At the beginning of our experience, we sense Him as the God of glory. But the more we experience Him, the more we realize that He comes in a human form, the same as we are. If God had not come to Abraham in such a human form, how could Abraham have been called His friend? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28909" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span> reveals that Abraham and God spoke with one another like friends. Abraham said to Him, “My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: let a <span class="pg" data-page-id="668" id="668">[668]</span> little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28910" data-verses="Genesis 18:3-4">vv. 3-4</span>). Abraham prepared water for God to wash His feet, and God rested under a tree in front of Abraham’s tent. </p>
<p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2NxeInStiDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> Very few Christians think that God would ever come in the form of a mortal man, rest under the shade of a tree, and wash His feet with the water that was prepared by a man. Which do you think is more pleasant—for God to sit on His throne demanding that we bow down to Him and worship Him, or for God to sit under a tree and wash His feet? Before the feet of the Lord Jesus were washed with the woman’s tears in the house of Simon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28911" data-verses="Luke 7:38">Luke 7:38</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28912" data-verses="Luke 7:44">44</span>), God’s feet were washed in front of Abraham’s tent. While Jesus was in the house of Simon having His feet washed and anointed, the priests of Judaism were worshipping God in the temple. Where was God at that time—in the temple in Jerusalem or in the house of Simon? Surely He was in the house of Simon. Likewise, where was God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28913" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span>—sitting on His throne waiting for Abraham to worship Him, or washing His feet beneath the tree in front of Abraham’s tent? How marvelous it was that He was in the form of a mortal man washing His feet in front of Abraham’s tent! Where is your God in your experience? Is He sitting on a throne in heaven or washing His feet at your tent? Do you prefer to have your God sitting on the throne, waiting for you to say, “Holy, Holy, Holy” to Him, or do you prefer to have Him sitting at your tent door? God came to Abraham on his level and in a human form. Since He came in this way, He and Abraham could be friends. In this chapter there is no religious worship or fear, just sweet intimacy. How wonderful! Who is your God today? Is He only the God of glory, the Most High God, and the El-Shaddai, or One in the form of a mortal man, the same as you are? </p>

In the first seventeen chapters of Genesis, there is no record of any intercession. Although we may suppose that Melchisedec was interceding behind the scene for Abraham, there is no record of this. The first clear mention of intercession in the Bible is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28953" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span>, where we see that Abraham was the first intercessor. This record of intercession is not simply a seed, for it contains a certain amount of development. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28954" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span> we not only have a story of intercession but a clear revelation of the basic principles of intercession. Intercession is a great thing in the Bible. Without it God’s economy cannot be accomplished. The excellent ministry of Christ today as our kingly and divine High Priest is a ministry of intercession. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28955" data-verses="Romans 8:34">Romans 8:34</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28956" data-verses="Hebrews 7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span> both tell us that Christ is interceding for us. Since this matter of intercession is so important, we must devote an entire message to it, mainly considering the basic principles of intercession. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="R_GfdTPWaEiXNNW82-yDaWV_DgKGLG6UWYb4K416h7Rart6vExDqqOyU38XwPBejO">a) According to God’s Revelation</h2><p data-content-id="sHB9QAVlSM3v0XjManno-nQ4rkT_fHA5fTkqfQSTHo75EQs1z1Iu7LXCJgPqSPnNs"> The first basic principle of intercession is that it must be according to God’s revelation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28957" data-verses="Genesis 18:17">18:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28958" data-verses="Genesis 18:20-21">20-21</span>). The only intercession that counts in the eyes of God is that which is according to His revelation. This means that proper intercession is not initiated by us but by God in His revelation. This is clearly portrayed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28959" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span>. Abraham did not wake up one morning concerned for Lot and then kneel down to pray to the One <span class="pg" data-page-id="678" id="678">[678]</span> on the throne in heaven regarding him. No, while Abraham was sitting at his tent door to cool himself in the heat of the day, God came to him in the form of a mortal man. Since God did not come to Abraham in His glory with His majesty, Abraham did not recognize at first that it was Jehovah God who was visiting him. Eventually, Abraham realized that this One was the very God. Nevertheless, Abraham was not terrified; he was very restful, conversing with God as with an intimate friend. This conversation must have lasted for several hours, for it took time to prepare the meal and to eat it. When God and the two angels were about to leave, Abraham did not bid them goodbye but conducted them on their way, probably walking with them for a good distance. Here we see that our God is not only a loving God but also a testing God. Although He loves us and knows everything, He often tests us. He knows our heart, the innermost part of our being, but He often says nothing. By testing He draws out what is within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XQ65Ldrvkw1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW"> What was God’s purpose in coming to Abraham in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28960" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span>? He surely did not come for a meal; neither did He come to confirm His promise regarding Sarah’s giving birth to a son. God came to Abraham because He was seeking an intercessor. On His throne in heaven, God had decided to execute His judgment on the wicked city of Sodom. But God would never forget that one of His people, Lot, was in that city. Lot did not even realize that he had to be rescued from Sodom. What could God do? He had to find someone to intercede for Lot. God knew that there was no one on earth who was as concerned for Lot and who was so much with God as Abraham was. Hence, God came to Abraham for the purpose of finding an intercessor. Without an intercessor to intercede for His people, God cannot do anything. God has His divine principles. One of them is that without intercession He cannot save anyone. The salvation of every Christian has been accomplished through intercession. God did not stay on His throne in heaven waiting for such intercession to occur. Rather, He came down to visit Abraham in the form of a mortal man so that Abraham might easily talk with Him and intercede for Lot. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28961" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span> Abraham did not pray to God or call on the <span class="pg" data-page-id="679" id="679">[679]</span> name of God; he talked to God as with an intimate friend. Thus, the purpose of God’s visit to Abraham in this chapter was that Abraham might take up the burden to intercede for Lot according to God’s desire. </p>
<p data-content-id="sHB9QAVlSM3v0XjManno-nQ4rmHXfHA5fTkqfQSTHo75EQs1z1Iu7LXCJgPqSPnNs"> Although God remained at Abraham’s tent door for several hours, talking a great deal to him, God did not say a word about His purpose in coming to secure an intercessor. We often act in the same way. Perhaps you want a brother to do a certain thing for you. If you are wise, you will not come to him and immediately ask him to do what you desire. You will first determine his mood by having a talk with him about various matters. At the very end of your visit, as the brother is seeing you to the door or conducting you on your way, you may open yourself to him and tell him of your desire. However, if he does not linger with you but says, “See you in the meeting tonight,” you will realize that his heart is too cold and that he would not be interested in doing what you want him to do. But if he says, “I would like to stay with you for a while longer,” then you will know that you can open yourself to him. </p>
<p data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XQ65LdprIw1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW"> When God came to Abraham, Abraham welcomed Him, providing Him water and serving Him a good meal. Although God spoke to Abraham during the preparation and eating of the meal, He did not disclose the purpose for which He came. Only when God rose up and walked away from the tent and Abraham accompanied and conducted Him and the two angels on their way, did God tell Abraham of His intention. While Abraham walked with them, the Lord said, “Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28962" data-verses="Genesis 18:17">18:17</span>). God could not hide His intention from Abraham, His dear friend and called one. </p>
<p data-content-id="LD01-v3um3NuLShGttlVirmWnW7MRg9jsTHcyuTXlEDKbBHncuqREEkOSwGaFv9xn"> As Abraham lingered in God’s presence, even after the two angels had left for Sodom, remaining standing before Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28963" data-verses="Genesis 18:22">18:22</span>), God opened up to him. God did not open to Abraham directly but in the way of implication. God did not say, “Abraham, I shall soon destroy Sodom. Lot is there, and I am very concerned about him. I have come to ask you to intercede for him.” God was not that simple. Instead, He said, “Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have <span class="pg" data-page-id="680" id="680">[680]</span> done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28964" data-verses="Genesis 18:20-21">18:20-21</span>). Although God did not say a word about Lot, His intention in speaking about Sodom was for Lot. These two friends talked about Lot, but neither of them mentioned his name. They spoke about him in a mysterious way, in a way of implication. Abraham knew that God’s concern was for Lot, and he interceded for Lot without mentioning him by name. Nevertheless, God knew Abraham’s intention as Abraham knew God’s intention. </p>

<p data-content-id="CAIiqFyjjgw0LbNxWLi5D8oX-xyGcXq_WajUO0fMiI1qsIetqtq6bkTvknnO7bFYb"> The Bible is a marvelous book. Alongside of the record of Abraham, it gives us the negative history of Lot. For quite a long time, I did not understand why the Bible included such a negative record. There are certain verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28980" data-verses="Genesis 19:1">Genesis 19</span> that, humanly speaking, I do not like to talk about. But the Lord’s divine revelation is economical; not one word is wasted. Hence, every word in the Holy Bible is very important. What then is the purpose of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28981" data-verses="Genesis 19:1">chapter nineteen</span> of Genesis? It is to give us a warning example. I have the strong burden that in this message so many of us, especially the young people, need to see this warning example. We need such an example because today’s situation is no better than that of Sodom. </p>
<p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KaYjpnQr7e1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> We thank the Lord that His Word gives us both a positive history of Abraham and a negative one of Lot. There is no record in the entire Bible that is as complete as the account of Abraham’s life. This record shows how Abraham was called by God, how he answered God’s calling, how he lived by faith in God for his existence, how he was trained to know grace for the fulfillment of God’s purpose, how he was dealt with by being circumcised, and how he was brought into intimate fellowship with God, cooperating with Him on the human level. I appreciate this record of a fallen man who was saved, transformed, and brought into wonderful fellowship on the human level with the glorious and holy God. Yet alongside of this record, we have a black, negative record of Lot. In <span class="pg" data-page-id="690" id="690">[690]</span> this message we must consider this record in detail, taking it as a warning for ourselves and for our children and relatives. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_TAc1C-JgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds">3) A Defeated Righteous Man</h2><p data-content-id="prNfLWZ9JdrW7yTc3YS3U-fX_o1moK-lAf5XbjI5e4-Pr6RDr_aquY_gO4K9YJN2U"> If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28982" data-verses="2Peter 2:6-9">2 Peter 2:6-9</span>, we see that Peter was much in favor of Lot. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28983" data-verses="2Peter 2:8">verse 8</span> Peter referred to him as a “righteous man” whose “righteous soul” was vexed with the unlawful deeds of the people in Sodom. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28984" data-verses="2Peter 2:9">verse 9</span> he describes Lot as godly. Thus, according to Peter’s concept, Lot was both righteous and godly. Although we may find it difficult to believe this because Lot’s record in Genesis is so negative, we must believe it because the Bible tells us so. If you still say that Lot was not righteous and godly, then I would ask you about yourself. Are you more righteous and godly than he? In a sense, Lot was more righteous and godly than many of us. But although he was saved, righteous, and godly, he was a defeated righteous man. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="vGPkFtfe7Aen3iGIVhF4Ddmvr6BhJoSKHjShQRi-Q6TFheMiOa11sXw6WrcmFYS61">a) Passively Brought into God’s Way by Others</h2><p data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKQgycn3g_CaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI"> As we consider Lot’s history, we see that he was passively brought into God’s way by others (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28985" data-verses="Genesis 11:31">11:31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="28986" data-verses="Genesis 12:5">12:5</span>), having been brought into God’s way by his grandfather and his uncle. His grandfather brought him from Ur of Chaldea to Haran, stopping halfway because the grandfather would not go on. When God took the grandfather away, Abraham, Lot’s uncle, took him from Haran to Canaan. Although it is good in the eyes of God that there are grandfathers and uncles who can bring their grandchildren and nephews into God’s way, it is not the best to be passively brought on by others. Lot had a very weak start. He did not have an active, positive beginning in spiritual things. Young people, it is not the best to be passive concerning holy things or your following of the Lord. Lot was righteous and godly, but he was defeated because he had a very weak, passive start. His passive beginning was the cause of his eventual defeat. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnD3881SPEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB">b) Never Having God’s Appearing</h2><p data-content-id="4ih-7ivO1f_Uex_xN1d2zJNldJq1CD7MrPWGnia394uU8LdMUmJUsII4OLzctGMcQ"> Lot never had God’s appearing. As I read through the <span class="pg" data-page-id="691" id="691">[691]</span> verses about Lot again and again, I could not find a hint that God ever appeared to him. Although God and the two angels visited Abraham, only the two angels came to Lot. Does this mean that God is unfair or a respecter of persons? Of course not. God is fair and is no respecter of persons. God did not appear to Lot or reveal Himself to Lot, because Lot was passive, not actively seeking God, and was living in a wicked city. He did not follow God in a direct way but in an indirect way and did not walk in the way of God. Unlike Abraham, Lot had no direct relationship with God. God does not respect persons, but He does respect behavior, respecting whether or not we are active or passive in seeking Him. If you seek Him, He will appear to you. But if you do not seek Him, He will not waste His time. That God did not appear to Lot was not God’s fault; it was Lot’s. God wants to appear to you, but are you seeking Him and walking in His way? Do you have a heart to seek God positively and actively and walk in the way of God? If you do, God will not fail you. He will certainly appear to you. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="oojwSJGvLbmiYj5tIQGoqYgcH5Pc4PdhX0jmIOM9tm0WtyG5HMI5sjMdIyAZ1hq_3">c) Never Taking the Initiative in Taking God’s Way</h2><p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQboE5rmREHTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> Lot never took the initiative in taking God’s way. I have been unable to find a verse which indicates that Lot ever took the initiative in this matter. The Bible says that Lot’s grandfather took him to Haran; it does not say that Lot followed him. There is a great difference between the two. I am somewhat concerned for the young people among us. Many of them are in the church life because someone brought them here. They did not take the initiative to come into the church life. As I look back upon the past fifty years, I can testify that those who showed initiative in taking the way of the church are still strong today. However, those who took no initiative but who were passively brought into the way of the church have gradually fallen away. I can give you a hundred names of those who were intimate with me and who were helped by my ministry who gradually fell away because they did not have a strong start by actively taking the initiative to follow the Lord. Lot should have said to Abraham, “Uncle Abraham, whether or not you take God’s way, I will take it. Even though <span class="pg" data-page-id="692" id="692">[692]</span> I am younger than you, I would be the leader in following God and would ask you to follow me.” To say this is not to be proud; it is to be active. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYgx5QseQG5oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa">d) His Relationship with God Being<br/>under the Influence of Others</h2><p data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0ZKDdYoSMonn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF"> Lot’s relationship with God was under the influence of others (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28987" data-verses="Genesis 13:1">13:1</span>). When others were up, he was up. When they were down, he was down. Lot was like a piece of driftwood. When his spiritual leader drifted into Egypt, he drifted there after him. He was altogether under the influence of others. When Abraham was drifting southward toward Egypt and the world, Lot should have withstood him and said, “Abraham, if you go downward, I’ll go upward.” But we see no such tendency in Lot’s life. I am concerned that in the church life today there is this kind of driftwood. Is your relationship with God under His direct appearing or under others’ influence? Do not think that Lot suddenly drifted into Sodom. No, it was a gradual development starting from a very weak beginning. If as you read this message you feel that you have not had a strong beginning, be encouraged for it is still not too late to lay a solid foundation. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="YWQf39oOaKT-w18LKhlsjo9In8kYDjHh52RJBmzJk0PH2LSkAzFUEZelzC01-ioTH">e) Leaving Others’ Spiritual Influence<br/>Because of Material Substance</h2><p data-content-id="E-xv1nlZl2LrnNkDtbmzOe46duSytUIFb3C0mvDz1LtjokSWkphwKc-Ng-yoBiibt"> Lot left others’ spiritual influence because of material substance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="28988" data-verses="Genesis 13:5-13">13:5-13</span>). When there was only the spiritual influence, Lot kept himself under it. But when Lot was faced with the choice between spiritual influence and material substance, he chose material substance. The principle is the same today. Material substance, that is, worldliness, is a test to those who follow the spirituality of others. Like Lot, they may be righteous but still choose material substance. </p>

<p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXQ1zVfpYi443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> The previous message was on Lot, who was a defeated righteous man. In this message we come to Lot’s wife, who became a pillar of salt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29020" data-verses="Genesis 19:26">19:26</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29021" data-verses="Genesis 19:1">Genesis 19</span> might be the only record in human history regarding a pillar of salt, and we need to consider it very carefully. This pillar of salt was not created by God. Lot’s wife became a pillar of salt. It is very meaningful that in His heavy word recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29022" data-verses="Luke 17:1">Luke 17</span>, spoken at a time when people were inquiring about the coming of the kingdom, the Lord Jesus said, “Remember Lot’s wife” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29023" data-verses="Luke 17:32">Luke 17:32</span>). In a sense, the Lord seemed to be saying to His disciples, “Don’t talk about the kingdom. Rather, you must recognize what the age will be like when the kingdom comes. It will be like the days of Noah and the days of Lot. Both are prefigures of the days of My coming.” Thus, in the Lord’s heavy, solemn, and sobering word, three ages are mentioned: the age of Noah, the age of Lot, and the age at the time of the Lord’s coming back. </p>
<p data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkw-ReeMnOoPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU"> When we covered Noah in some of the foregoing messages in this life-study, we pointed out that he lived in a befuddled age, and that the people of his age were befuddled, drugged, and doped by their lusts and evil pleasures. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29024" data-verses="Luke 17:27">Luke 17:27</span>, when the Lord spoke of the days of Noah, marriage was mentioned. But when He spoke of the days of Lot, there was no mention of marriage, because in Sodom marriage had been completely degraded, and the people indulged in their sodomitical lust. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29025" data-verses="Luke 17:28">Luke 17:28</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29026" data-verses="Luke 17:30">30</span> the Lord said, “Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building....It will be in the same <span class="pg" data-page-id="702" id="702">[702]</span> way on the day in which the Son of Man is revealed.” After saying this and immediately before telling us to remember Lot’s wife, the Lord said, “In that day, he who shall be on the housetop and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away; and he who is in the field, likewise, let him not turn back to the things behind” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29027" data-verses="Luke 17:31">Luke 17:31</span>). In Palestine the houses had flat roofs. The Lord was saying, “If you are on your housetop at the time of My coming, do not come down into your house to take away your stuff. If you do, you will be left. If you are working in the field, do not return home. You must forget everything except Me.” Immediately after this word, the Lord said, “Remember Lot’s wife.” </p>
<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6OqdaaGr9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> Today, like the people in the days of Noah and in the days of Lot, many Christians are doped and befuddled, having lost the proper sense of the things of God. Some even teach that believers may be raptured while they are playing football. But according to the revelation of the Holy Word, when the Lord comes back, He would not take any of His saints who are still participating in worldly entertainments. We Christians are the crop of God growing with Christ as the life seed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29028" data-verses="Matthew 13:3-8">Matt. 13:3-8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29029" data-verses="Matthew 13:18-23">18-23</span>). No Christian who is mature in the growth of life still participates in any worldly entertainments. Since the Christians who continue to participate in worldly entertainments are not ripe, but are green and raw, the Lord would not reap them from the field. The befuddled Christians of today need to hear such a sobering word. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjJtAH-HBcGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD">4) A Pillar of Salt</h2><p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qcWVIz7JdzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> The record of Lot’s wife becoming a pillar of salt is found in the section on living in fellowship with God. Although this section in Genesis covering <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29030" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">chapters eighteen through twenty-four</span> is the record of a life that was in fellowship with God, it includes the black record of a defeated saved man, his wife, and his two daughters. Lot had more than these two daughters, but when the angels came to Sodom, they could not find the others. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29031" data-verses="Genesis 19:15">Genesis 19:15</span> says, “When the morning arose, the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are found; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city” (Heb.). The angels seemed to be saying, <span class="pg" data-page-id="703" id="703">[703]</span> “Lot, we can only find two of your children. We were sent here by God to rescue you and all your family, but only these have been found. Our commission is to destroy the city. Now you, your wife, and your daughters must escape.” The next verse says that Lot lingered. According to the original, Lot not only lingered; he hesitated, being unwilling to leave the city. Since he was hesitating, the angels “laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.” When the angels had brought the four of them outside the city, they said, “Escape for thy soul; look not behind thee” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29032" data-verses="Genesis 19:17">v. 17</span>, Heb.). But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29033" data-verses="Genesis 19:26">verse 26</span> says that Lot’s wife “looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.” Lot’s wife was saved, for she was pulled out of the city and saved from its destruction. But although she was saved, she nevertheless became a pillar of salt. It is certain that becoming a pillar of salt is not a good thing; it is a shame. </p>
<p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KaYjtnRfTe1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> As I have said many times, the book of Genesis contains the seeds of nearly all the divine truths. The pillar of salt in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29034" data-verses="Genesis 19:26">19:26</span> may also be considered as a seed. The growth of this seed is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29035" data-verses="Luke 17:32">Luke 17:32</span>, where the Lord tells us to remember Lot’s wife, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29036" data-verses="1John 2:28">1 John 2:28</span>, where we are told that we might be put to shame at the Lord’s appearing. The harvest is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29037" data-verses="Revelation 16:15">Revelation 16:15</span>, where the Lord says, “Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who watches and keeps his garments, that he may not walk naked and they see his shame.” The Lord will come as a thief, not giving any prior notification. If at that time our nakedness is exposed, we shall be put to shame. Thus, the seed of being put to shame was sown in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29038" data-verses="Genesis 19:1">Genesis 19</span>, grows in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29039" data-verses="Luke 17:1">Luke 17</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29040" data-verses="1John 2:1">1 John 2</span>, and is reaped in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29041" data-verses="Revelation 16:1">Revelation 16</span>. My burden in this message is to impress you that the book of Genesis not only has the seed of Abraham, but also the seed of Lot and of his wife, who became a pillar of salt, a sign of shame. </p>
<p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_TAY1DalgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> The basic concept of this message is that a genuine saved person faces the definite possibility of being put to shame. Do not listen to the befuddling teachings of this age. Many teachings in Christianity today drug people, and those who absorb <span class="pg" data-page-id="704" id="704">[704]</span> such teachings are neither sober in their mind nor living in their spirit. In this message we need to hear a sobering word from the Lord, a word that will sober our mind and quicken our spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="prNfLWZ9JdrW7yTc3YS3U-fT_qhGoK-lAf5XbjI5e4-Pr6RDr_aquY_gO4K9YJN2U">a) Lot’s Wife</h2><p data-content-id="vGPkFtfe7Aen3iGIVhF4Ddmrr4FFJoSKHjShQRi-Q6TFheMiOa11sXw6WrcmFYS61"> As we have already pointed out, there is no doubt that Lot’s wife was saved from destruction. This is so definitely and clearly revealed that no one can argue with it. But, as we have seen, she looked back from behind her husband and became a pillar of salt. That she walked behind her husband indicates that she was even less willing than her husband to leave Sodom and that she was not happy to follow him out of the city. If she had been happy to flee Sodom, she would have walked side by side with her husband. Even before she looked back and became a pillar of salt, she was already behind her husband. At this point, let me say a word to the wives. In committing sin, it is good for a wife to be reluctant to follow her husband, but concerning the things of God, it is not good for her to be slow in following him. Concerning the things of God, the best thing for a wife to do is to go along with and walk together with her husband. Wives, in the things with God, do not go behind your husbands. If you do, you, like Lot’s wife, may suffer and become a pillar of salt. This is a warning to us all. </p>

<p data-content-id="0JV8hDILxxkbeRl9MfljI5trqw_FVL0iYCHdxKUekJ14F8oFrW_U5yl_qzhcrk_AB"> As I have pointed out many times, nearly all the seeds of the divine revelation are found in the book of Genesis. A seed is a primitive form of something. Although its size is small and its form is simple, once a seed has been sown into a field, it will grow. As it grows it takes on another form. First it is a sprout and later it is fully developed. Although the final form of its development is different from that of the seed, all the principles and major aspects of it are found within the seed. If we would understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29064" data-verses="Genesis 19:1">Genesis 19</span>, we must consider it as a seed which has its growth, development, and harvest in the following books of the Bible. Although the record concerning Lot and his daughters in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29065" data-verses="Genesis 19:30-38">Genesis 19:30-38</span> is a negative seed, concerning such an ugly thing as incest, it serves the positive purpose of giving us a strong, sobering warning. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYQr88VlYlMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx">5) The Seed by Incest</h2><p data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZhg3rUhsp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6"> In this message we must see the portrait of a most ugly thing—incest. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29066" data-verses="Genesis 19:30-38">Genesis 19:30-38</span>, probably the first recorded case of incest in human history, is part of the section on living in fellowship with God. As we consider this matter, we must cover six points: the family, the father, the mother, the daughters, the seed, and the far-reaching and unsearchable mercy of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="BLE5KA_UJUWmNHemF8RznNy-epIh0O1klPDPPz_cM4ETPjCdTs_KDy-6YMjsxBV2U"> Firstly, we have the family, the group, and secondly, we have the father, the leader of this group. Thirdly, we have the mother who was the leader’s helper. The leader of any group needs help. The proper helper in a family is the wife, and in the Bible a wife is called a helpmeet. In figure, the wife in a family signifies a helper in life. This concept is according to <span class="pg" data-page-id="714" id="714">[714]</span> the principles of the Bible. Consider the example of Sarah. Abraham had a family for God’s purpose, for Abraham alone could do nothing for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. He needed a helper in life. Although he turned to Hagar for help, she was not a helper in life but a helper in the flesh. Sarah was the unique helper, the one who had the function in life. Without her, Abraham could never have brought forth Isaac for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. The church today is a spiritual family in which there also is the need of the proper function in life to bring forth “Isaac” for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. As we shall see, at a certain point, Lot’s family group lost its function in life because the wife became a pillar of salt. She should have been salty and maintained a good flavor, but due to her worldliness she lost the function in life. In figure, becoming a pillar of salt indicates the loss of the function in life. Although there was a group with a leader, there was no wife with the function in life, only a pillar of shame. This is true of many Christian groups today. Although these groups have leaders, they do not have the proper wife with the genuine function in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="x52sBK0RPP8CO8qDhR2srqfGtl0q0DNKTmsXdJCAVgGjfw6s5s9H5KtPnduIvZkRU"> Because Lot’s family had lost its function in life, it had improper members—the daughters. I am not happy to call the members of Lot’s group daughters, for the word daughters is a good term. What kind of people were they? Were they daughters or wives or mothers? I simply do not know what to call them. If you call them daughters, you must say that they were incestuous daughters. Although they might have been mothers, they were incestuous mothers. I feel ashamed to even speak of what they did. After lying with their father, the first daughter encouraged the second to do the same thing. How shameful! These were the members of Lot’s group. Many Christian groups today also have such improper members. They, like Lot’s daughters, desire to have the seed but do not care for the proper means. They may say, “Let us go to win souls,” but they win souls through the way of spiritual incest. </p>
<p data-content-id="E-xv1nlZl2LrnNkDtbmzOe4iduSStUIFb3C0mvDz1LtjokSWkphwKc-Ng-yoBiibt"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29067" data-verses="Genesis 19:30-38">19:30-38</span> we have the group, the leader, the helper in life, the members, and the seed by incest. But praise the Lord that eventually the far-reaching and unsearchable mercy of God is seen in one of the descendants who came out of this <span class="pg" data-page-id="715" id="715">[715]</span> incest. Ruth, a Moabitess, a descendant of Lot through his daughter, became the great grandmother of David and an ancestress of Christ. Is this not the far-reaching and unsearchable mercy of God? However, when we hear of this, we should not say, “Let us do evil that good may come.” </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2zyeOYwNY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df">a) The Family—the Group</h2><p data-content-id="Ss-Kv9Ptsxb3Hpm3OLvQWSQC3WUZkwLJkPM-9Yo5gpNrugTwkZhE_qWQlLbkcq0fN"> Let us now consider these six points in more detail. Based upon the principle that everything in the book of Genesis is a seed, we may say that Abraham’s tent, in which he had intimate fellowship with God on the human level, was a miniature of the tabernacle which God commanded Abraham’s descendants to build as His dwelling place on earth. Abraham’s tent was the seed, and the tabernacle erected in the wilderness by the children of Israel was the growth. The temple built in the good land of Canaan was a further development of this seed. Today’s church, as the real dwelling of God on earth, is the fulfillment of what has been portrayed in the Old Testament by Abraham’s tent, the tabernacle, and the temple. Eventually, the New Jerusalem will be the ultimate harvest of this seed. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29068" data-verses="Revelation 21:3">Revelation 21:3</span> says that “the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall tabernacle with them.” Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29069" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span> we have the seed, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29070" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span> we have the harvest. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUDsBBjBPjRtaf2PAgd0RJmGJne1KXdsQrQ3vEcVWKTvzkKR8PehPPTdnoCg5OrXo"> In the same principle, during the time of Abraham and Lot, God had a people on earth. His people were composed of two families, the families of Abraham and of Lot. This was a seed, a miniature, of God’s people in the following ages. Firstly, the children of Israel were the development of the seed of God’s people, and now the church today is the continuation of this development. Eventually, in the New Jerusalem we shall see that all the redeemed ones throughout the generations will be the full harvest of God’s people on earth. Once again we have the seed, the development, and the harvest. By this we see that what is present with the seed should also be found with the development. </p>
<p data-content-id="e4Tu7RSEEn956Bu43KIdFt9BenEhLhbqE99G8qhMhliWdoAMPEcx2IgxrawDytCgr"> At the beginning, Abraham’s family and Lot’s family, being God’s people, were one. At a certain time, however, division came in and they were divided. When they were one, they <span class="pg" data-page-id="716" id="716">[716]</span> were not a group; they were the people of God, God’s one people. When division came in, it produced a free group. That ancient free group was the seed and the miniature of today’s free groups. The free groups among God’s people today are actually a further development of this seed. The division which was sown by Lot was developed after the time of Solomon when the children of Israel were divided and a free group was produced. That free group, the nation of Israel, was never recognized by God. God only recognized Judah because Judah was on the proper ground. The principle is the same in the church age. The whole church should be God’s one people. In the early days, the church was uniquely one. But division after division came in, producing many free groups. We praise the Lord that this division will not continue into the new heaven and new earth. It will be terminated by the Lord’s coming back. </p>

Can you believe that after having such intimate fellowship with God and after making such a glorious intercession, Abraham could have the experience recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29111" data-verses="Genesis 20:1">chapter twenty</span>? It is difficult to believe and understand how Abraham could have shown such weakness. Once again we see that the Bible is not man-made. If it were of human manufacture, the writer would not have included this record of Abraham’s weakness and shortcomings. But the Bible is honest and it has <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29112" data-verses="Genesis 20:1">Genesis 20</span> as part of the divine record. </p>

In this chapter two
main things are recorded: the hidden weakness and a shameful intercession. Abraham, a man of God, had a weakness hidden deep within him. While in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29118" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">chapter eighteen</span> he made a glorious intercession, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29119" data-verses="Genesis 20:1">chapter twenty</span> we find the record of a shameful one. </p>

<p data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-ytt1PyAKBFlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo"> Let us first consider Abraham’s hidden weakness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29120" data-verses="Genesis 20:1-16">20:1-16</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29121" data-verses="Genesis 20:1">verse 1</span> we are told that “Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country.” Abraham’s journeying toward the <span class="pg" data-page-id="728" id="728">[728]</span> south meant that he had left the standing of fellowship at the oaks of Mamre in Hebron. He should have remained in Hebron because there he had intimate fellowship with God. Nothing is better than this. It was not too long after he had intimate fellowship with God that he left Hebron and journeyed southward. Between the time the Lord spoke to Abraham regarding the birth of Isaac in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29122" data-verses="Genesis 17:21">17:21</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29123" data-verses="Genesis 18:14">18:14</span> and the time of Isaac’s birth in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29124" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span>, there could not have been more than a year. Why did Abraham suddenly leave Hebron and journey toward the south during that year? In figure, south signifies easiness and north hardships. The south is warm and the north is cold, but God dwells in the north (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29125" data-verses="Psalms 48:2">Psa. 48:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29126" data-verses="Psalms 75:6-7">75:6-7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29127" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:4">Ezek. 1:4</span>). In the north we have hardships with God’s presence. In the south we have easiness, but without God’s presence. There is no hint in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29128" data-verses="Genesis 20:1">Genesis 20</span> that God told Abraham to journey southward. In making this journey, Abraham acted on his own. </p>
<p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXQ1zNfocO443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> Abraham might have wanted to have a change and take a vacation. Although you may be enjoying the church life in Anaheim, one day you may feel that you need a change and desire to journey southward to Mexico City. The church life is marvelous and we all enjoy it very much. But some may become a little bored and want to take a trip to Las Vegas. If you go to Las Vegas and meet someone there who asks about what you do at home, you will find it difficult to give him an honest answer. On two occasions, when Abraham was in such a situation, he was not truthful (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29129" data-verses="Genesis 12:9-12">12:9-12</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29130" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">chapter twelve</span> Abraham journeyed southward because there was a famine in the land. That famine gave him an excuse for going southward to Egypt. But in this chapter Abraham had no excuse. He and his wife might have been bored and wanted a vacation. If they had remained by the oaks of Mamre in Hebron, Abraham would have had no need to lie. His lying was due to his wrong position. We see by this that the proper standing means a great deal. I do not believe that any brother can pray-read or give a living testimony in a casino in Las Vegas. He would not have the standing there to do such a thing. In order to do anything for God, we must have the proper standing. When Abraham left the standing of intimate fellowship <span class="pg" data-page-id="729" id="729">[729]</span> with God and journeyed southward, he lost God’s presence. The Bible does not say that in the south country God appeared to Abraham, nor that Abraham erected an altar and called on the name of the Lord. He had altogether lost the proper standing on which he could have fellowship with God. Young people, you must see that you need to stay in the right position. If you stay in the church, you will be kept and preserved. But if you journey southward, you will forsake the proper standing and lose God’s presence. Spontaneously, your old man will return. </p>
<p data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkw-RGeNTuoPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU"> Before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29131" data-verses="Genesis 20:1">chapter twenty</span> Abraham was circumcised. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29132" data-verses="Genesis 20:1">chapter twenty</span>, he should have been a circumcised person, not a natural person, for he had truly been dealt with by God. Some Christians claim that once they have experienced a certain blessing, they can no longer be in the flesh. But look at the example of Abraham. Although he had been circumcised both physically and spiritually, when he left the proper standing of fellowship with God, he was in the flesh again. After having such a high attainment in his experience with God, Abraham, the father of faith, acted the same as he did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29133" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span>, more than twenty years before. By this we see that as long as we are still in the old creation we are capable of doing anything in the flesh. If we do not remain in fellowship with God, we can do the same things that the worldly people do. Do not say that because you have been regenerated, have experienced the baptism of the Spirit, or have had a second blessing, you can no longer be in the flesh. However many are the blessings that you have received from God, if you do not remain in fellowship with Him, you will be in the flesh. Your experience proves that this is true. </p>
<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6OqFabiP9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> We should never have any confidence in our self. The self is absolutely untrustworthy. We must put our trust in the presence of the Lord, telling Him, “Lord, if You take Your presence away from me, I am just a dog. But I praise You that in Your presence I’m a saint, one of the people of God.” How much God’s presence means to us! When Abraham was bringing God on His way in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29134" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">chapter eighteen</span>, he was a wonderful saint, a man who could stand before God and talk face to face with Him as with an intimate friend. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29135" data-verses="Genesis 20:1">chapter twenty</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="730" id="730">[730]</span> this wonderful person became very mean. After he had left the standing of fellowship with God, he could lie at the sacrifice of his wife. It seems unbelievable, but he did it. If we consider our past experience, we shall find that at least a few times we have done the same kind of thing. This shows us the importance of remaining in the presence of God. Our protection is not our self; it is His presence. </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjJtYH8T5cGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD">(2) Repeating the Old Failure</h2><p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qcWNIx_1dzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> After Abraham had left God’s presence and had journeyed toward the south, he repeated an old failure—lying by sacrificing his wife (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29136" data-verses="Genesis 20:2">20:2</span>; cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29137" data-verses="Genesis 12:11-13">12:11-13</span>). To lie is one thing, and to sacrifice our wife is another. Although many brothers may lie, perhaps none of them would sacrifice his wife. But Abraham did it. I admire Sarah for being such a good wife. She did not complain but was agreeable with her husband’s lie. </p>

In those chapters we saw that Abraham, God’s called one, had come to many stations and had passed through many stages. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29160" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">Genesis 21</span> Abraham comes to a wonderful and marvelous station. Here Isaac is born. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="gUDsBBjBPjRtaf2PAgd0RJmOJmaRKXdsQrQ3vEcVWKTvzkKR8PehPPTdnoCg5OrXo">7) The Birth and Growth of Isaac</h2><p data-content-id="e4Tu7RSEEn956Bu43KIdFt9JemwZLhbqE99G8qhMhliWdoAMPEcx2IgxrawDytCgr"> The goal of God’s calling of Abraham was to bring forth a seed. This matter of the seed was first mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29161" data-verses="Genesis 12:7">12:7</span> and is referred to many times in the following chapters. In nearly every chapter God touched Abraham concerning the seed. Why was it so difficult for Abraham to have a seed? He was called, at the latest, at the age of seventy-five, but twenty-five years later he still did not have the seed, although God had called him for that very purpose. Because he had difficulty producing the seed, Abraham first relied upon Eliezer, whom God rejected. Then, hearkening to his wife’s proposal, Abraham produced Ishmael by Hagar. However, God also rejected Ishmael, saying that He did not want a seed out of an Egyptian maid but out of Sarah. God seemed to say to Abraham, “Yes, you have produced a seed, but it is out of the wrong source. I will never approve that source. I have nothing to do with it. You may love Ishmael and care for him, but I do not.” After the birth of Ishmael, God came in to tell Abraham that he had to be circumcised. At that time, God also strengthened and confirmed His promise to Abraham. After his circumcision, Abraham had intimate fellowship <span class="pg" data-page-id="738" id="738">[738]</span> with God, enjoying the highest experience with God of anyone in history up to that time. </p>
<p data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_LUfSUPl0w3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj"> When, at the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29162" data-verses="Genesis 20:1">chapter twenty</span>, the seed still had not come, even such a giant of faith as Abraham could not stand the test. As we saw in the last message, he was apparently bored in his experience of God and took a vacation. Abraham might have said to God, “God, You have promised again and again to give me a seed. You have dealt with me about this and that until I have nothing left. You have said no to everything I have done. Now I am bored and would like a change. I want to take a vacation.” Abraham journeyed southward, that is, downward. Like everyone who takes a vacation after working hard, Abraham was seeking easiness. Because of this, he repeated an old failure. But God preserved him, creating a situation in which, in spite of his failure, circumstances, and environment, he had to intercede for Abimelech and his house. Not one thing was an encouragement to Abraham in this matter. Yet, being the giant of faith, he interceded, not with boldness or the release of the spirit, but in a shameful way. Nevertheless, his shameful intercession was answered. Not only did Abimelech’s wife and maidservants bear children, but Sarah also gave birth to Isaac. One prayer of intercession received two answers. When we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29163" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">Genesis 21</span> we see that Abraham has returned from his vacation and is back in business again. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29164" data-verses="Genesis 20:1">chapter twenty</span> he tried to take a vacation and stay away from his divine job, but he did not succeed and God forced him to make an intercession. That intercession brought him back from vacation to his divine employment. Now, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29165" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span>, Abraham is back in his “office.” </p>
<p data-content-id="NgrUOPst9ndCGqPDKS1sPH8q5BbxKLEkyN_8bfWBSPyO-5g1-dnym0-8I86wUsKBc"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29166" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">Genesis 21</span> has two sections. The first section, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29167" data-verses="Genesis 21:1-13">verses 1 through 13</span>, is thoroughly covered by the Apostle Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29168" data-verses="Galatians 4:22-31">Galatians 4:22-31</span>, where he allegorizes this portion of Genesis. By means of Paul’s allegorization, seeking Christians throughout the centuries have been able to learn the true significance of the first part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29169" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">Genesis 21</span>. I wish that Paul had allegorized the remainder of that chapter, but he kept silent about it. Most Christians only consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29170" data-verses="Genesis 21:14-34">21:14-34</span> as a story of Ishmael’s dwelling in the wilderness and becoming <span class="pg" data-page-id="739" id="739">[739]</span> an archer and of Abraham’s dealing with Abimelech over the well at Beer-sheba, not thinking that this portion of the Word has much spiritual significance. But if the first section of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29171" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">Genesis 21</span> has a spiritual significance, then the second section must also have a spiritual significance. In this message we need to cover the significance of both sections. </p>

As far as Abraham and Sarah were concerned, the birth of Isaac was a great matter. What is the spiritual significance of Isaac’s birth? This is easy to see from Paul’s allegory in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29180" data-verses="Galatians 4:1">Galatians 4</span>. As Abraham was called by God, so we are God’s called ones today. In God’s calling us there is a goal, the same goal as there was with His calling Abraham—to bring forth the seed. God has called us to bring forth Christ. If you consider the experience of Abraham as recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29181" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">chapters eleven through twenty</span> and compare it with your own, you may be surprised to see that his experience is the same as yours and that his life is your biography. Our biography was written long before we were born. Whatever our age or generation may be, we all have the same biography. As Abraham was called to bring forth Isaac, so we have been called to bring forth Christ. We have not been called to produce good behavior. God’s goal is that we bring forth Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWJhnBEoatXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> All the difficulties Abraham encountered in bringing forth Isaac were on his side, not on Isaac’s. In like manner, it is easy for Christ to come through and out of us, but we have many problems. In fact, we ourselves are the problem. We simply are not the right persons to bring forth Christ. Although we can produce many things and have done so ever since we were saved, it is very difficult for us to bring forth Christ. I was a Christian for many years and still did not know how to bring forth Christ. I did not even know what it meant to bring Him forth. I am concerned that so many of us do not have the thought of bringing forth Christ. Some might <span class="pg" data-page-id="740" id="740">[740]</span> even ask, “Hasn’t Christ been brought forth already? Why must we bring Him forth again?” Yes, Christ has been brought forth, but every saved person must still bring Him forth. </p>
<p data-content-id="MtCll2XOY8R8dFgTUXdR4bNU7Xob8JwNRjNJM9TIVoQfsRCA1WYTsZI35lh9oQ1PX"> In order to bring Christ forth, we must be circumcised. Our natural life and strength and our self must be terminated. This termination opens the way for the very El-Shaddai, the all-sufficient One, to come into our being as the all-sufficient grace to bring forth Christ. Abraham experienced this. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29182" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">Genesis 21</span>, Abraham reached his goal and Isaac was born, having been brought forth through Abraham. Today Christ, the real Isaac, needs us to bring Him forth. Both the Christian life and the church life are simply the bringing forth of Christ. We must bring Christ forth in our meetings, daily life, home life, and on our jobs. </p>

<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6uGT5lJJWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29236" data-verses="Genesis 22:1">Genesis 22</span>, where we see the climax of Abraham’s experience with God. This chapter is the continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29237" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span>. These two chapters, giving the record of the birth and offering of Isaac, cover a period of at least twenty years. Some scholars believe that when Isaac was offered he was at least twenty years old. Thus, he was a full-grown man by then. </p>
<p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWjzt-4sfgfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> Everything recorded in these two chapters is very meaningful. As we pointed out in the last message, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29238" data-verses="Genesis 21:33">21:33</span>, “Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the Eternal God” (Heb.). This planting of the tamarisk tree was not an insignificant thing. Although Abraham must have done many things while he was living in Beer-sheba, the Bible only records that he contended for the well, bought it back at a cost, planted a tamarisk tree, and called on the name of the Lord, the Eternal God. If these were insignificant things, the biblical record, which is very economical, would not have included them as part of the divine revelation. The fact that the divine revelation excludes many other things but includes the record of the planting of a tamarisk tree shows its importance. </p>
<p data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXkV_lgMy0wrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip"> The center of the revelation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29239" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> is the tree of life. Likewise, the center of the revelation in the second part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29240" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">Genesis 21</span> is the tamarisk tree. If we have the spiritual realization with the divine light, we shall see that the tamarisk tree here is the tree of life experienced and expressed. When the tree of life is not experienced or expressed by us, it is simply the tree of life. But once we experience and express it, <span class="pg" data-page-id="754" id="754">[754]</span> it becomes a tamarisk tree. A tamarisk tree has slender branches and very fine leaves showing the flow of the riches of life. Thus, the tamarisk tree planted by the well of an oath in Beer-sheba pictures the flow of the riches of life, the issue of the experience of the tree of life. Is the tree of life a tamarisk tree in your experience? Whenever we come to the meetings, the tree of life must become a tamarisk tree. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LmZEyaCDKrZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> With Ishmael there was not a tree flowing with the riches of life; there was a bow. While the sign of Ishmael’s life was a life-killing bow, the sign of Isaac’s life was a life-flowing tree. As a Christian, a child of God and a descendant of Abraham, what is your sign—a bow or a tamarisk tree? Are you killing life, or is life with all its riches flowing in you? </p>
<p data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtqJW4iJvD_u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m"> If the tree of life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29241" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> is important, then the tamarisk tree in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29242" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">Genesis 21</span> must also be important. Very few Christians, if any, have seen the importance of the tamarisk tree at Beer-sheba. Although some have paid a little attention to the tree of life, they have not paid attention to the tamarisk tree. In the past we did see the tree of life, but we did not see the tamarisk tree. Thank the Lord that in these days He has given us the vision of the tamarisk tree. One day, the inward stirring told me that I had to know the significance of the tamarisk tree in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29243" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span>. Although this chapter does not waste a word, ignoring the other things that Abraham must have done, it specifically says that he planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba. According to our opinion, the planting of a tamarisk tree may be insignificant, perhaps being only an ancient type of landscaping. But the Bible connects the planting of the tamarisk tree with calling on a new title of the Lord, the Eternal God. Notice how the conjunction “and” is used to connect these two items in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29244" data-verses="Genesis 21:33">21:33</span>. Abraham planted a tamarisk tree and there called on the name of Jehovah, El Olam. According to our human thought, planting a tree is unrelated to calling on the name of the Lord, especially to such a new and recently revealed title. But in the Bible here it gives us the ground for the proper calling on the Lord. If we would call on the name of the Lord, we need a tamarisk tree. If we do not have this tamarisk tree <span class="pg" data-page-id="755" id="755">[755]</span> experience, we can only call on the old title of God, Jehovah, not on His newly unveiled title, El Olam. </p>
<p data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIITvaGwDfD0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29245" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span>, Abraham called on a new title of God—El Olam, the mysterious, hidden, secret, yet so real, living, and ever-existing God. This title of God implies the term eternal life, for the eternal God means the eternal life. Abraham experienced the eternal life, but he did not have this term. The people in ancient times ate vitamins, but they had no scientific knowledge of them nor scientific terms to describe them. Because we were born after the writing of the New Testament, we have the term eternal life. But Abraham, who lived in ancient times, did not have such a divine term. Nevertheless, when he called on the name of Jehovah, El Olam, it is implied that he experienced God as the ever-existing and ever-living life, as the One who is real and living, yet so mysterious and secret. </p>
<p data-content-id="yObOo7LOjjFarxWXeCIo4NA0-W6LfP03Kiwq9oNdUXzgDgrb2yrYAyxlelIIkT9lp"> We need to consider our own experience. Whenever we have had the flow of the riches of the divine life, that was the time when we called on the name of the Lord Jesus with a new realization. We called on the same Lord, but in our calling we had a fresh sense. Do you think that if you held the life-killing bow in your hand, you would be able to call on the Lord’s name? No, rather you would go to find an Egyptian wife. </p>

<p data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYQr8wVksdMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx"> In the original text of the Bible, there are no chapters, verses, or paragraphs. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29246" data-verses="Genesis 22:1">Chapter twenty-two</span> is the immediate continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29247" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span>. After the mention of Abraham’s planting a tamarisk tree and calling on the name of the Lord, God came in to test him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29248" data-verses="Genesis 22:1">v. 1</span>, Heb.). God, unlike Satan, never tempts anyone. But He does test us like He tested Abraham. I say again that after Abraham redeemed the well in Beer-sheba, he undoubtedly did many things, but, except for the planting of the tamarisk and calling on the name of the Lord, the Bible does not mention them. Rather, it immediately speaks of God’s testing Abraham. <span class="pg" data-page-id="756" id="756">[756]</span> </p>

At such a time the Lord may say, “You have received a gift from and of Me. Now I ask you to return it.” We always expect that after having a good time with the Lord He will command us to do something for Him. We never imagine that He may ask us to give back to Him that which He has given us. As Abraham was enjoying intimate fellowship with God, he was not commanded to work for Him. He received the highest demand from God—to give back to God what God had given him. From the very beginning, God never accepted anything that Abraham had. He did not care for Lot, rejected Eliezer, and told him to cast out Ishmael. Now, after Eliezer, Lot, and Ishmael had all been rejected, Abraham had acquired Isaac, the seed promised by God, and was at peace. Everything concerning Isaac was of God and by God. Never again would God say no to what Abraham had. But suddenly God came in and seemed to say, “I would never refuse Isaac. He was born of and from Me. But, Abraham, now you must give him back to Me.” </p>

<p data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD0Wu50DPfiWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP"> In the last message we saw how Abraham offered his son Isaac according to God’s demand. That story, recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29289" data-verses="Genesis 22:1">Genesis 22</span>, is not only a meaningful history but also has an implied significance, for it is a vivid picture of Christ in several aspects. Although we cannot find the title of Christ nor the name of Jesus in this chapter, many aspects of Christ are signified in the way of implication. In this message we need to see the aspects of Christ depicted in this chapter. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROmKDVTkX2OlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX">c) Isaac Typifying Christ</h2><p data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9BmbthKkq6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr"> Isaac typified Christ. We have seen that Abraham answered God’s call to go to Mount Moriah to offer Isaac. This is history. However, if we view this matter from the perspective of God’s revelation, we shall see that what Abraham did to Isaac is a vivid picture of what the Father did to His beloved Son. When Abraham journeyed to Mount Moriah with Isaac, two young servants accompanied him. On the third day, Abraham put the two servants aside, saying, “I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29290" data-verses="Genesis 22:5">v. 5</span>). From that point on, the story was different. It was no longer a story of four people—the father, the son, and the two servants; it was now a story of Abraham and his son Isaac. Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac, who bore it to the top of Mount Moriah. Compare this with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29291" data-verses="John 19:17">John 19:17</span>, which says, “And bearing the cross Himself, He went out to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.” Isaac walked the same path on the way to Mount Moriah that the Lord Jesus later walked <span class="pg" data-page-id="768" id="768">[768]</span> on the way to Golgotha. Before Christ bore the cross and walked to Calvary, Golgotha, Isaac bore the wood for the burnt offering and walked along the same way. And Jesus was crucified on the same mount where Isaac was laid on the altar. Thus, we see that Abraham was a type of the Father, and Isaac, with the wood upon him, was a type of the Only Begotten Son of God. Isaac was brought as a lamb to the altar. Jesus was also “brought as a lamb to the slaughter” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29292" data-verses="Isaiah 53:7">Isa. 53:7</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="FyrUURSenH7AUUlr0ndgcvcgHkT-vlth22OadvBKOnc_QUvWSaFJlMIPAfMT2Bdu2"> As Abraham and Isaac were climbing Mount Moriah, Isaac said, “Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29293" data-verses="Genesis 22:7">v. 7</span>). Abraham replied, “My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29294" data-verses="Genesis 22:8">v. 8</span>). Here we see that the son fellowshipped with the father. Do you not believe that while Jesus was bearing the cross on the way to Calvary He fellowshipped with the Father? And do you not believe that the Father talked with His Son? I do. If you say that the Bible does not tell us of this, I would say that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29295" data-verses="Genesis 22:1">Genesis 22</span> tells us so. We need to have the sight and the listening ear to hear the heavenly conversation on the way to Mount Moriah. Abraham and Isaac typified the Father and the Son, and their fellowship on the way to Mount Moriah was a vivid picture depicting how Jesus the Son fellowshipped with the Father as He was bearing the cross to Calvary. Although we do not have a clear explanation of this in plain words in the New Testament, we do have the picture in the Old Testament, and a picture is better than a thousand words. The picture in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29296" data-verses="Genesis 22:1">Genesis 22</span> portrays something which words cannot explain. Although the writers of the New Testament did not describe the loving fellowship between the Father and the Son on the way to Calvary, it is clearly portrayed in the picture in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29297" data-verses="Genesis 22:1">Genesis 22</span>. How we all need to see this picture. As we shall see, nearly every point regarding the type in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29298" data-verses="Genesis 22:1">Genesis 22</span> is covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29299" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="CAIiqFyjjgw0LbNxWLi5D8o_-yyGcXq_WajUO0fMiI1qsIetqtq6bkTvknnO7bFYb"> Let us consider now some details of Isaac as a type of Christ. Isaac was Abraham’s only son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29300" data-verses="Genesis 22:2">vv. 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29301" data-verses="Genesis 22:12">12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29302" data-verses="Genesis 22:16">16</span>). This typifies Christ as God’s only Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29303" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>). Isaac was Abraham’s beloved son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29304" data-verses="Genesis 22:2">v. 2</span>), and Christ was the Father’s beloved Son in whom He delighted (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29305" data-verses="Matthew 3:17">Matt. 3:17</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29306" data-verses="Genesis 22:5">22:5</span> we see <span class="pg" data-page-id="769" id="769">[769]</span> that Isaac took his father’s will, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29307" data-verses="Matthew 26:39">Matthew 26:39</span> we see that Christ chose the Father’s will. In the picture in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29308" data-verses="Genesis 22:1">Genesis 22</span>, we see that Isaac, a full-grown man, was obedient unto death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29309" data-verses="Genesis 22:9-10">vv. 9-10</span>). According to the record of this chapter, in the matter of offering Isaac, Abraham consulted neither with his wife Sarah nor with his son Isaac. Abraham took his son, put the wood upon him, led him up the mountain, bound him, and laid him on the altar. He did not give Isaac the opportunity to say anything. But Isaac took his father’s will and was obedient to death. Likewise, when the Lord Jesus was about to die, He said, “Not as I will, but as You will” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29310" data-verses="Matthew 26:39">Matt. 26:39</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29311" data-verses="Philippians 2:8">Philippians 2:8</span> we are told that Christ was obedient unto death. Look again at the picture: Isaac was obedient unto the altar. He not only followed the father to the foot of the mount; he also obeyed him in taking up the wood and in being bound. He did not resist. Even when the father laid him on the altar, took the knife, and stretched out his hand to slay him, he did not rebel. He was obedient unto death. If we consider all these aspects of Isaac as a type of Christ as portrayed in the Old Testament, we shall see that they were sovereignly arranged, matching the clear word of the New Testament revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LmZEOaAXirZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> In God’s eyes, Isaac was killed. Just as Abraham was about to slay his son, the angel of the Lord intervened from heaven, saying, “Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him.” The angel of the Lord here is actually God Himself. This is proved by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29312" data-verses="Genesis 22:12">verse 12</span> in which the angel of the Lord said to Abraham, “I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.” The “me” here is God Himself. Notice that the angel of the Lord did not say “from him,” but “from me.” Abraham, the father, put his son to death, but the angel of the Lord raised him up from the dead. In like manner, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29313" data-verses="Acts 2:24">Acts 2:24</span> says that God has raised up Christ from the dead. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtqJWEiLrv_u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m">d) Isaac Replaced by a Ram</h2><p data-content-id="6CXs4WE0BL6-B1B4FDiAFqZsue3XzGKjTYJeRnGmeXBe72gXmUfpgBoC9qhDjO81n"> Isaac was replaced by a ram, that is, by a lamb. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29314" data-verses="Genesis 22:13">Verse 13</span> says, “Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a <span class="pg" data-page-id="770" id="770">[770]</span> burnt offering in the stead of his son.” Here we see that the son was not killed, but the ram, the lamb, was. Who was killed on the cross—the Son of God or the Lamb of God? It was the Lamb of God who was killed. Christ is the Son of God, but when He was killed on the cross, He was replaced by the Lamb of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29315" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, speaking of the Son of God, says, “We beheld His glory, glory as of an only begotten from a father.” But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29316" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span> says, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” Here we see that the Son of God was replaced by the Lamb of God. The Lamb of God, not the Son of God, was crucified. In crucifixion, the Son was replaced by a ram. </p>
<p data-content-id="R_GfdTPWaEiXNNW82-yDaWVbDhuiLG6UWYb4K416h7Rart6vExDqqOyU38XwPBejO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29317" data-verses="Genesis 22:8">22:8</span> Abraham prophesied that God would provide a lamb for a burnt offering. The eternal Lamb was ordained by God from eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29318" data-verses="1Peter 1:19-20">1 Pet. 1:19-20</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29319" data-verses="Genesis 22:13">22:13</span> we see “a ram caught in a thicket by his horns.” In the Bible horns signify fighting power. Christ has the fighting power, but it was caught by a thicket. The thicket signifies humanity. We are the thicket, and Christ, the Lamb of God, has been caught in us and cannot escape. He has been caught by His human nature that He might be offered as our substitute. Christ as the Lamb of God was willing to have His horns caught by humanity. When we see this clear picture, we all must say, “Lord, thank You. You were willing to be caught by us.” </p>

<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQJ1f6eSpG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29350" data-verses="Genesis 23:1">Genesis 23</span>, a chapter which records the death and burial of Sarah. When I was young, I did not see why this chapter was included in the book of Genesis. I could not understand why, when Abraham must have done many great things which are not recorded, twenty verses were used to describe how he spent his time, energy, money, and even his politeness to acquire a burying place. But the Bible does not waste any words. Since every word of the Bible is God’s breath, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29351" data-verses="Genesis 23:1">Genesis 23</span> must be very significant. If we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29352" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span> as being important, we must also consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29353" data-verses="Genesis 23:1">Genesis 23</span> as being important. Every Christian appreciates <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29354" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> because it gives a record of God’s creation. We appreciate <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29355" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> not merely as a record of creation but also as a record of life. It speaks of God’s image and dominion as related to the man created by God. We also appreciate <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29356" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> because it tells us of the tree of life. However, few of us appreciate a sepulcher. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29357" data-verses="Genesis 23:1">Genesis 23</span> is focused on the matter of a burying place and gives us a detailed account of the purchase of a sepulcher. More details are included in this story than in any other record in the book of Genesis. While every other record is quite brief, this one gives a full and clear account of where the tomb was located, who owned it, how it was purchased, and the amount Abraham paid for it. This sepulcher is mentioned in a very significant way, for we are told that not only was Sarah buried there, but that Abraham, Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah were buried there also. It is very significant that the names of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are the components of <span class="pg" data-page-id="778" id="778">[778]</span> the divine title of God who is the God of resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29358" data-verses="Matthew 22:32">Matt. 22:32</span>). </p>

The New Jerusalem is not found in this chapter, but it can be seen through it. This chapter is like a telescope: through it we can see the eternal tabernacle that is far off in the future. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnmXdEK7MvQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29360" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">Genesis 21</span> gives us the record of the birth of Isaac. This was certainly worth mentioning. Following this, in the same chapter we are told that Abraham redeemed a well, planted a tamarisk tree, and called on the name of Jehovah, El Olam. As we have seen, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29361" data-verses="Genesis 22:1">chapter twenty-two</span> we have the offering of Isaac. Then, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29362" data-verses="Genesis 23:1">chapter twenty-three</span>, we have the death and burial of Sarah. These three chapters cover at least thirty-seven years. Although a great many things must have happened with Abraham during these thirty-seven years, only four things are mentioned: the birth of Isaac, the living in Beer-sheba, the offering of Isaac, and the death and burial of Sarah. These three chapters exclude many things which, according to our human concept, are important, but include a detailed record of the death and burial of Sarah. Because of this, we must pay close attention to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29363" data-verses="Genesis 23:1">Genesis 23</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-ytt1PCAIVtlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo">a) In Hebron—the Place of Fellowship with God</h2><p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXQ1z9fqYi443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29364" data-verses="Genesis 22:1">chapter twenty-two</span>, Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac were dwelling at Beer-sheba, undoubtedly living near the covenanted well and the tamarisk tree. This was a miniature of the church life, for the church life is always by a well of living water and a tamarisk tree. Suddenly, at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29365" data-verses="Genesis 23:1">chapter twenty-three</span> we are told of Sarah’s death. Although Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac were living at Beer-sheba, she died and was buried in Hebron, the place of fellowship with God. Sarah went on from Beer-sheba to Hebron. In like manner, if the Lord delays His coming back, I would like to live in the church life and die in the fellowship with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2Nx6InS9iDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> According to the map, Hebron is between Beer-sheba on the south and Jerusalem on the north. It is on the way from <span class="pg" data-page-id="779" id="779">[779]</span> Beer-sheba to Moriah, where Jerusalem is. If the Lord delays His coming back, I would like to be buried in a place which is on the way to the New Jerusalem. Where are you living today? We all must answer that we are living in Beer-sheba, in the church by the well of living water and the tamarisk tree. Our church life is today’s Beer-sheba. Before the Lord comes back, some of the older ones may leave Beer-sheba, the church life, die in Hebron, and wait there for the New Jerusalem. Hebron is not only a place of fellowship with God; it is also a way to Jerusalem. The cave of Machpelah in Hebron is the gateway to the New Jerusalem. Perhaps some day we shall hear Sarah testify, “When I entered into the cave of Machpelah, I entered into the gate which leads into the New Jerusalem.” Sarah was not simply buried in the cave of Machpelah; she is now sleeping there, waiting for the day when she will wake up and find herself in the New Jerusalem. </p>

Although this may seem to be very old today, at that time it was an early age to die. Abraham lived one hundred seventy-five years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29367" data-verses="Genesis 25:7">25:7</span>), living thirty-eight years after Sarah died. Sarah should not have died at such an early age. Her death, thirty-seven years after Isaac’s birth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29368" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">17:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29369" data-verses="Genesis 17:17">17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29370" data-verses="Genesis 21:5">21:5</span>), was abnormal. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7Wn7yel3Z3ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo">c) Abraham’s Suffering</h2><p data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKQgywn3gvCaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI"> Abraham and Sarah were the best couple in the whole universe. They truly loved one another, never having any consideration of divorce or separation. When Abraham was robbed of his wife, it was a great loss to both Abraham and Isaac. Isaac was a dear son to his mother, and she undoubtedly loved him very much. At the age of thirty-seven, he was still unmarried and lived with his mother. When he did marry at the age of forty (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29371" data-verses="Genesis 25:20">25:20</span>), the Bible even tells us that Isaac was married in his mother’s tent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29372" data-verses="Genesis 24:67">24:67</span>). Suddenly, the love between Abraham and Sarah and between Sarah and Isaac was broken, for Sarah, the wife and mother, was taken away <span class="pg" data-page-id="780" id="780">[780]</span> by an abnormal death. Because of this, Abraham suffered greatly. </p>
<p data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnD3Q81SfEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB"> If you read Abraham’s history, you will see that God was always taking things away from him. Lot separated from him, Eliezer was rejected, Ishmael was cast out, and Isaac was offered to God on the altar. Then his dear wife was taken away in death. What trials and sufferings Abraham passed through! According to our natural concept, Abraham, one who was so good with God, should not have suffered all these things. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29373" data-verses="Genesis 22:1">chapter twenty-two</span> Isaac was offered to God and returned to Abraham in resurrection. Suddenly, while Abraham was enjoying a happy life with his wife Sarah and his son Isaac, Sarah, the factor of his happiness, was taken away. The happiness in this family was dependent upon Sarah, the wife and the mother. When Sarah died, the atmosphere, life, and happiness of this family were all taken away, and the family itself was gone. What a suffering that was to Abraham! </p>
<p data-content-id="4ih-7ivO1f_Uex_xN1d2zJNJdJqlCD7MrPWGnia394uU8LdMUmJUsII4OLzctGMcQ"> As God’s called ones, we should not expect to have a happy life here on earth. We must follow the steps of Abraham looking for a better country, for a city with foundations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29374" data-verses="Hebrews 11:10">Heb. 11:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29375" data-verses="Hebrews 11:16">16</span>). Our temporary life on earth is the life of a traveler. Due to this, Abraham paid little attention to his dwelling place and simply erected a tent. He was a sojourner, a stranger, who was looking for a permanent dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="oojwSJGvLbmiYj5tIQGoqYgwH5PM4PdhX0jmIOM9tm0WtyG5HMI5sjMdIyAZ1hq_3"> Abraham lived for thirty-eight years without Sarah’s help (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29376" data-verses="Genesis 25:8">25:8</span>). In the Bible, the number thirty-eight is the number of sufferings, trials, and tests. The children of Israel suffered trials and tests in the wilderness for a period of thirty-eight years. As we have seen, Isaac was forty years old when he married. In the Bible, the number forty also means trials, temptations, and tests. We also have another number in this chapter—four hundred—which is ten times forty. The first time the number four hundred is used in the Bible is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29377" data-verses="Genesis 15:13">Genesis 15:13</span>, where Abraham was told that his descendants would suffer affliction for four hundred years. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29378" data-verses="Genesis 23:16">23:16</span> we read that Abraham bought the sepulcher at the cost of four hundred shekels of silver. This indicates that it was a test, trial, and suffering. <span class="pg" data-page-id="781" id="781">[781]</span> </p>

If we would probe into the depths of the book of Genesis, we must see these two things. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29399" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> we see that man was made in God’s image. The man here is not an individual man but a corporate man. We may say that it is mankind, a corporate Body that can express God’s image. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29400" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we see that for the fulfillment of God’s purpose we must have the divine life signified by the tree of life. In these two chapters we have two crucial words—image and life. Image reveals God’s eternal purpose, and life unfolds God’s way of fulfilling His purpose. Never consider Genesis as merely the record of God’s creation and the history of some patriarchs. This view is too superficial. When we plunge into the depths of this book, we see that it is not merely a record of creation and history, but that it is a revelation of God’s eternal purpose and His way of fulfilling it. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="bdPZiOYGTI0GDMWc0r7m5QPkNHaZCY4FzwTm0_1hM378LkILri-YBA6MHtvxUHmDQ">10) The Marriage of Isaac</h2><p data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIITfGGx33D0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs"> With these two points in mind, let us now come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29401" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">Genesis 24</span>. Everyone who reads Genesis thinks of this chapter as the record of a marriage. However, the important thing here is not the marriage but what the marriage indicates, implies, and typifies. When we were on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29402" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span>, we saw that those chapters are not only a record of God’s creation but a record of life. Everything found in those chapters is related to <span class="pg" data-page-id="788" id="788">[788]</span> life. Anything that is not related to life is excluded. If you read those chapters carefully, you will see that many aspects of God’s creation are omitted because they are not related to life. In the same principle, only those aspects of Abraham’s history which are related to life are recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29403" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">chapters twenty-one through twenty-four</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="yObOo7LOjjFarxWXeCIo4Nwo-XenfP03Kiwq9oNdUXzgDgrb2yrYAyxlelIIkT9lp"> The entire book of Genesis, a book of only fifty chapters, covers over twenty-three hundred years, the first twenty-three centuries of human history. If Genesis were a record of history, it would need hundreds of chapters to cover this span of time. The fact that such a long period is covered in just fifty chapters proves that Genesis is not a record of history. I say again that although Genesis apparently is a record of history, it actually is a record showing God’s eternal purpose and the way of fulfilling it by life. Anything which is not related to God’s purpose and its fulfillment by life is not recorded in this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="8UouUokiSDmfQ5btvmO_u8iFcySULW5y_xM7y0Cjh31lO6uhzd5IR1LXaUCBwG1Zr"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29404" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">Chapters twenty-one through twenty-four</span>, covering forty years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29405" data-verses="Genesis 25:20">25:20</span>), mention five main things: the birth of Isaac, the growth of Isaac, the offering of Isaac, the death and burial of Sarah, and the marriage of Isaac. Although this record is brief, it is very meaningful. Here we see a proper birth and the proper growth. This birth and growth produced a burnt offering for God’s satisfaction. After the birth and growth in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29406" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span>, we have the burnt offering in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29407" data-verses="Genesis 22:1">chapter twenty-two</span>. Then, as we have seen, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29408" data-verses="Genesis 23:1">chapter twenty-three</span> we have the death of Sarah and a detailed account of her burial. Following this, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29409" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span>, we see a wonderful marriage. But this chapter is not merely the record of a marriage; it is a story which has a deep meaning and significance in life. </p>

However, this is not the main point. The primary point is the practical living in oneness with the <span class="pg" data-page-id="789" id="789">[789]</span> Lord for the fulfilling of God’s purpose. We should not understand the Bible according to our common knowledge or tradition, but come back to the pure Word. Whenever we read any portion of the Scriptures, we must forget all we have learned in the past and look to the Lord for something new. Fifty years ago I read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29410" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">Genesis 24</span> carefully, doing my best to remember every point. Nevertheless, when I come to this chapter now, I do not care for what I had in the past. I like to come to this portion of the Word as if I were reading it for the first time. I can testify that just recently I have seen something new in this chapter. </p>
<p data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9BmrNhLAG6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr"> Have you ever realized that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29411" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">Genesis 24</span> we can see a practical living in oneness with the Lord? As we have seen, God has a purpose, and the way to fulfill His purpose is by life. These are the two governing points in understanding the Bible. If we would understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29412" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">Genesis 24</span>, we must apply these two governing points. Why does <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29413" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">Genesis 24</span> give us such a record of Isaac’s marriage? If we only read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29414" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span> we cannot see the purpose of this record. In order to answer this question we must read the three foregoing chapters. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29415" data-verses="Genesis 21:12">Genesis 21:12</span> says, “In Isaac shall thy seed be called.” God called Abraham with a purpose. For the fulfillment of this purpose, God promised to give Abraham the good land and the seed which would inherit the land. God’s eternal purpose is to express Himself in a corporate way. In order to have this corporate expression, God must have a people. This people is the seed of Abraham. Furthermore, in order to have the people to express God corporately there is the need of the land. What then is the purpose of the marriage in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29416" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">Genesis 24</span>? Is it simply that a single man might have a happy, comfortable life? No. If you consider the Bible as a whole, you will see that Isaac’s marriage was altogether for the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose. Without marriage, how could Isaac have brought forth the seed? If this single man was to have seed for the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose, he had to get married. After Abraham had been tested in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29417" data-verses="Genesis 22:1">chapter twenty-two</span>, God said, “In blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the <span class="pg" data-page-id="790" id="790">[790]</span> gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29418" data-verses="Genesis 22:17-18">22:17-18</span>). Here we also have the seed for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. Thus, Isaac’s marriage was not common nor merely for his human living; it was for the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose. </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="FyrUURSenH7AUUlr0ndgcvsAHmHevlth22OadvBKOnc_QUvWSaFJlMIPAfMT2Bdu2">(1) Abraham</h2><p data-content-id="CAIiqFyjjgw0LbNxWLi5D8Yf-w2icXq_WajUO0fMiI1qsIetqtq6bkTvknnO7bFYb"> Abraham’s living was a practical living in oneness with the Lord. Abraham did not suddenly have a vision in which God told him that He had a high purpose to carry out on earth, that He needed him, and that Isaac had to be married in order for God’s purpose to be fulfilled. There is no such vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29419" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span>. Rather, the record in Genesis is common and human. According to this record, a man had a son in his old age. When this son was thirty-seven years old, the wife and mother died, and the father buried her in a very meaningful way. The father and the son, both of whom were now unmarried, were left alone, living together in that sad condition for three years. The son might have said, “Father, where is my mother?” and the father might have replied, “Son, where is your wife?” The father was burdened to take care of his son. Perhaps he said, “I have lost my wife, and my son is now forty years of age. This surely is the right time for him to get married. But we are surrounded by Canaanites, none of whom would ever be accepted by God.” There is no record that God said, “Abraham, let Me charge you to send someone to your own country to get a wife for Isaac. I will never allow you to take a Canaanite woman as a wife for your son.” Although there is no record of God’s saying this, Abraham did have this understanding. From where did he derive it? It came from his living in accordance with God’s concept. </p>

<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQdCZHqsfFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B">b) A Type of Christ Marrying the Church</h2><p data-content-id="QMSNPOcCBLw6v-EOydvwYE1xIucTduX4YH5_O01lRUzkJdbjHu_x8PZ2HwO74uIjb"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29454" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">Genesis 24</span> we see a marriage which is a type of Christ marrying the church. In the New Testament we cannot find a verse which says that this marriage is a type of Christ marrying the church. However, the New Testament clearly reveals that Isaac, the son of Abraham, was a type of Christ being Abraham’s unique seed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29455" data-verses="Galatians 3:16">Gal. 3:16</span>). Based upon the fact that Isaac was a type of Christ, we may infer that Isaac’s marriage was a type of the marriage of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7WnLSekT93ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo"> Because the Bible is a divine book composed with the divine concepts, we can see these concepts in the various biblical records. For example, we are all familiar with the story of Joseph. Although there is no word in the New Testament saying that Joseph was a type of Christ, any reader of the Bible can recognize that Joseph’s story closely resembles that of Christ. Some Bible teachers say that we should not allegorize anything in the Scriptures unless the <span class="pg" data-page-id="800" id="800">[800]</span> New Testament indicates that it is an allegory or a type of certain spiritual things. But we should not insist on this, for although the New Testament does not say that Joseph was a type of Christ, every Bible teacher recognizes that Joseph was an excellent type of Christ. As we read the story of Joseph, we see that it depicts the life of Christ. Many incidents in Joseph’s life, such as his betrayal, are similar to those in the life of Christ. In the same principle, because Isaac is a type of Christ and because the marriage of Isaac resembles the marriage of Christ, we may say that the marriage recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29456" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">Genesis 24</span> is a type of the marriage of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKQgCQn10XCaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29457" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">Genesis 24</span> we have four main persons: the father, the son, the servant, and the bride. This is very meaningful. As we come to the New Testament, we see that the Triune God is working together to obtain a bride for the Son. What is the subject of the New Testament? If you say that the subject of the New Testament is just Jesus as our Savior, I would say that this is good, but that it is not all-inclusive. The subject of the New Testament is the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, working together to obtain the bride for the Son. The Father made the plan, the Spirit carries out the Father’s plan, and the Son enjoys what the Father has planned and what the Spirit carries out. Who is the bride? The bride is a part of the human race which will marry the Son and become His counterpart. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29458" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> speaks of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In the Acts and Epistles we see how the Spirit works according to the Father’s plan to obtain the bride for the Son. At the end of the New Testament, in the book of Revelation, we see the bride. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29459" data-verses="Revelation 19:7">Revelation 19:7</span> says, “The marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready.” Ultimately, the whole New Jerusalem, a city-lady, will be the bride (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29460" data-verses="Revelation 21:2">Rev. 21:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29461" data-verses="Revelation 21:9-10">9-10</span>). Although such a term as city-lady may sound strange, there is nothing wrong with using it, because the New Jerusalem will be a female, the wife of the Lamb, the counterpart of the Son of God. The entire New Testament is simply a record of the Triune God working together to gain a part of the human race to be the bride, the counterpart, of the Son. <span class="pg" data-page-id="801" id="801">[801]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnDHw83WjEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB">(1) The Father’s Plan</h2><p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQbo01rmRUHTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> Firstly, we have the Father’s plan. According to the King James Version, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29462" data-verses="Ephesians 3:11">Ephesians 3:11</span> speaks of “the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.” The word purpose is an archaic term for the modern word plan. When we speak of God’s plan we are referring to God’s purpose. In eternity past God made a plan, a plan to have the church for Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29463" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8-11">Eph. 3:8-11</span>). God’s plan is not just to have a group of sinners, nor to have a group of redeemed ones. Such a concept is too low. God’s plan is to have a bride for His Son. </p>
<p data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYgxJcseQW5oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa"> We have heard time and time again that Christ came to save sinners. But have you ever heard a message telling you that Christ came to have the bride? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29464" data-verses="John 3:29">John 3:29</span> says, “He who has the bride is the bridegroom.” In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus told His disciples that He was the Bridegroom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29465" data-verses="Matthew 9:15">Matt. 9:15</span>). He came not only to save sinners but to have the bride. Are we still sinners? No, we are the bride! Praise the Lord that we are no longer sinners—we are the bride! Should we still come to God confessing our sins in a begging way? No, we must come to Him joyfully, saying, “Praise the Lord! I am so happy that I am no longer a sinner. I’m a part of the bride!” Christ came not merely to be our Savior and Redeemer; He also came to be the Bridegroom. God did not plan to save a group of poor sinners and bring them all into heaven. God planned to take a part of the human race and make them the counterpart of His dear Son. Eventually, in the new heaven and the new earth, we shall not have a group of pitiful sinners; we shall have the bride, the New Jerusalem, the wife of the Lamb. </p>
<p data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0ZKzRYoSconn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF"> As we have seen, God the Father planned to take a bride for His Son out of the human race. Abraham, a type of the Father, charged his servant, a type of the Holy Spirit, not to take a wife for his son from the daughters of the Canaanites but from Abraham’s kindred (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29466" data-verses="Genesis 24:4">24:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29467" data-verses="Genesis 24:7">7</span>). In typology, this indicates that the counterpart of Christ must come from Christ’s race, not from the angels nor from any other creatures. Since Christ was incarnated as a man, humanity has become His race. Do not always think of humanity as <span class="pg" data-page-id="802" id="802">[802]</span> being so poor. Humanity is not poor. Because humanity is the race of Christ, it is dear and precious to God. Only out of humanity can God obtain the counterpart for His Son. Therefore, we all must be proud of being a part of humanity and must say, “Praise the Lord that I am a man! Thank Him that I was not created as a part of the angelic race but as part of the human race.” </p>
<p data-content-id="YWQf39oOaKT-w18LKhlsjoNEn8kIDjHh52RJBmzJk0PH2LSkAzFUEZelzC01-ioTH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29468" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we see that God brought the living creatures to Adam to be named by him. Adam said, “This is a dog, and this is a cat. This is a monkey, and this is a donkey.” As he looked at all those creatures, he did not find his counterpart among them. Thus, God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, took one of his ribs, and built it into a woman as his counterpart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29469" data-verses="Genesis 2:21-22">2:21-22</span>). Hence, Adam and Eve were of the same race. This indicates that Christ’s counterpart must come from His race, the human race. We all have been created as the human race, and as a part of the human race we all have been reborn. Only the human race is qualified to be the counterpart of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="E-xv1nlZl2LrnNkDtbmzOeI2duSCtUIFb3C0mvDz1LtjokSWkphwKc-Ng-yoBiibt">(2) The Spirit’s Errand</h2><p data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2zCKOYwdY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df"> While the father had a plan, the servant received a commission, an errand (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29470" data-verses="Genesis 24:33">v. 33</span>). Abraham commissioned him to go to his race and take a wife for his son. This signifies that God the Father has commissioned God the Spirit. The New Testament reveals such a divine commission. </p>

The content of this revelation is God’s eternal purpose. As we have pointed out many times, God’s eternal purpose is to work Himself into a corporate man so that He may have a corporate expression in the universe. If we would understand any portion of the Bible in a proper way, we must keep this matter in mind. </p>
<p data-content-id="YWQf39oOaKT-w18LKhlsjoNIn9gsDjHh52RJBmzJk0PH2LSkAzFUEZelzC01-ioTH"> In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29517" data-verses="Genesis 25:1">Genesis 25</span>. Many years ago, I did not like the first part of this chapter. But since there are no wasted words in the Bible, this portion of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29518" data-verses="Genesis 25:1">Genesis 25</span> must be very significant. If we do not keep before us the purpose of the revelation in the holy Word, we shall be unable to see the significance of this part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29519" data-verses="Genesis 25:1">Genesis 25</span>. By His mercy, the Lord has shown us the depth of this portion of the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="E-xv1nlZl2LrnNkDtbmzOeI6dvm6tUIFb3C0mvDz1LtjokSWkphwKc-Ng-yoBiibt"> In both Genesis and Romans we are told clearly that Abraham was very old when he begat Isaac. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29520" data-verses="Romans 4:19">Romans 4:19</span> says that Abraham considered his body as good as dead. Yet, forty years after Isaac’s birth, Abraham married again (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29521" data-verses="Genesis 25:1">25:1</span>), and when he became one hundred forty years of age, he still begat six sons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29522" data-verses="Genesis 25:2">25:2</span>). How can we explain this? If he was as old as a dead person when he was a hundred years of age, he certainly must have been more like a dead person when he remarried at the age of one hundred forty. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29523" data-verses="Genesis 23:1">chapter twenty-three</span> Sarah died and was buried, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29524" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span> Abraham obtained a wife for Isaac, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29525" data-verses="Genesis 25:1">chapter twenty-five</span> he himself married again.

<p data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2zCGOZUhY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29526" data-verses="Genesis 25:1">Genesis 25</span> also includes a record of the birth of Jacob and Esau. Why is such a wonderful record included in the same chapter which names the six sons of Abraham’s concubine? The record of Abraham’s six sons is negative, whereas the record of the birth of Jacob and Esau is positive. If you were <span class="pg" data-page-id="814" id="814">[814]</span> composing this chapter, would you put these two records together? None of us would have written this chapter in such a way. Nevertheless, according to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, it must be very significant. </p>

Although he was old in his physical life, he was not matured in his spiritual life. </p>
<p data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3OhlvP2ZIDDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12"> As we have seen, God’s purpose is to work Himself into a corporate person that He might have a corporate expression. In order to accomplish this, God created the heavens, the earth, and man with a spirit as his receiving organ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29527" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">Zech. 12:1</span>). This man was created in God’s image to express Him and with His dominion to represent Him in His authority. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29528" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> we see that Satan injected himself into man, and man became fallen. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29529" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">chapters three through eleven</span> man had at least four falls. After the fourth fall, God came in to call Abraham out of the fallen race and establish him as the father of the called race. God’s intention in making Abraham the father of the called race was to work Himself into that race for the fulfillment of His purpose. Although God did not have the opportunity to work Himself into the created race, the Adamic race, He now had an opportunity to work Himself into the called race, the Abrahamic race. The record from the last half of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29530" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">chapter eleven</span> through the first part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29531" data-verses="Genesis 25:1">chapter twenty-five</span> shows how much God worked with this person. However, when we come to the end of the record of Abraham’s life, do we see a person who was matured in life and who expressed God in every way? No. Abraham was not yet such a person. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQJFz6fWFG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> Many Christians appreciate Abraham too much. Although I respect Abraham and I do not belittle him, I must point out that, as the record of Genesis indicates, he was not matured in the divine life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29532" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">Chapter twenty-four</span> is wonderful, but it is not wonderful with respect to Abraham’s life but with respect to his activity. Abraham did a wonderful thing in choosing a <span class="pg" data-page-id="815" id="815">[815]</span> proper wife for his son; yet, immediately after this, he remarried. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29533" data-verses="Genesis 25:1">Genesis 25</span> does not say, “After Abraham had found a good wife for Isaac, he lived with them in the presence of the Lord for more than thirty years. One day, he called Isaac and Rebekah to him, laid his hands upon them, blessed them, and then went to be with the Lord.” If the record were like this, we would all appreciate it, saying, “Here is a saint who was matured in life.” What is the proof of the maturity in life? It is blessing others. When we are young, we receive blessings from others. But when we are mature, we pass on blessings to others. Although Abraham was old, he did not bless anyone. This proves that he did not have the maturity in life. </p>

Ishmael was produced by Abraham’s flesh, and Isaac was produced by God’s grace. What about the six sons? They were produced by even more flesh. After the birth of Ishmael, Abraham’s flesh was dealt with, and grace came in to replace it. But after the birth and growth of Isaac, Abraham’s flesh became active again. In the first section, the section with Ishmael, Abraham’s flesh was onefold, but in the third section, the section with the six sons, his flesh was sixfold, having been intensified six times. While the younger flesh produced one Ishmael, the older flesh produced six sons. </p>
<p data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkw-haeNT-oPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU"> The Bible is honest, telling us that Abraham married Keturah and begat six sons by her. But Abraham knew God’s will. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29535" data-verses="Genesis 25:5">Verse 5</span> says, “Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.” Isaac was the unique heir, the heir chosen, designated, and established by God.

Abraham had two concubines. The first gave birth to Ishmael, and the second gave birth to six sons. But God did not want any of them. Both before and after the birth of Isaac, Abraham did something which God did not want. How can we say that such a life is mature? </p>

It is right that we appreciate him, but we must realize that he had a great lack. He was called, had faith, and lived in fellowship with God, but, to use a New Testament term, he did not have sufficient transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qcmRIx_FdzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> What is transformation? Once again I would like to use the example of petrified wood. As water flows through the wood, the element of wood is carried away and the elements of minerals are added in its place. As the mineral elements are wrought into the wood, the wood is transformed into stone. This is petrification. We are wood, and the flow of living water must carry away our natural element and bring into our being all the divine, heavenly, holy, and spiritual elements. In this way we are transformed. </p>

He was a man who lived in fellowship with God and who acted according to His leading, but he was not transformed in full. Rather, he remarried and exercised the flesh which had been dealt with by God to bring forth six more “Ishmaels.” Although we must be like Abraham, we need to see that in himself he was not a complete pattern. </p>

It is not easy for Christians to understand the experience of Isaac.

As we read the record of his life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29559" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">chapters twenty-one through twenty-eight</span>, what do we see of the experience of life?

But it is difficult to say what experience of life we find in the record of Isaac. </p>
<p data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8AfonztgdHGuPeQc1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq"> In the record of Isaac’s life the experience of grace is implied. What Isaac experienced was the inheriting of God’s grace. The grace of God was not as fully revealed in the Old Testament as it is in the New Testament, because grace actually came through Jesus Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29560" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span>). After Christ came, there is a full and thorough revelation of grace, and in the New Testament the word grace is used again and <span class="pg" data-page-id="824" id="824">[824]</span> again. The New Testament even closes with the mention of grace: “The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29561" data-verses="Revelation 22:21">Rev. 22:21</span>). The Bible begins in the Old Testament with the word, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,” and it ends in the New Testament with the word, “The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints.” Although the record in Genesis concerning Isaac does not have the term grace, nevertheless such a thing is implied there. This is the reason that it is quite difficult for many to understand the Bible. In the Bible, there may be a certain thing but not the term to describe it. Although Isaac’s experience is recorded in Genesis, it is difficult to designate the experience he had as the experience of grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6u2D5mJJWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> According to the New Testament revelation, as far as the experience of life is concerned, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob should not be considered as three separate individuals, but as aspects of one complete person’s experience of life. Abraham represents the aspect of being called, of living by faith in God, and of living in fellowship with God. Isaac represents the aspect of inheriting grace and enjoying the inheritance of grace. Jacob represents the aspect of being chosen, being dealt with by the Lord, and being transformed into a prince of God. In the experience of life, there is the aspect of enjoyment, the enjoyment of grace. Most of us have heard messages saying that the Christian life should be a suffering life, a life of bearing the cross and groaning in prayer. Have you not heard messages telling you that today is not the time of enjoyment but the time of suffering and of bearing the cross, and that our enjoyment will begin at the time of the Lord’s coming back? I do not say that this is wrong, but I do say that it is only one aspect of the Christian life. There is another aspect—the aspect of enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="e4Tu7RSEEn956Bu43KIdFtNdenExLhbqE99G8qhMhliWdoAMPEcx2IgxrawDytCgr"> In the biblical and experiential sense, grace means enjoyment. Grace is the enjoyment in our Christian life. Our Christian life has three aspects: the aspect of Abraham, the aspect of Isaac, and the aspect of Jacob. In the aspect of Abraham we cannot see much enjoyment. Although Abraham was blessed and was enlarged, he did not have very much enjoyment. He lost his father, and Lot became a grief to him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="825" id="825">[825]</span> Eliezer, in whom he trusted, was rejected, and Ishmael, the son he begat by his own endeavor with his concubine, was cast out. After Isaac was born, God required that Abraham offer him up as a burnt offering. Not too long after Isaac was returned, Abraham lost his dear wife. Throughout his whole life we can see the aspect of loss. Although the Bible does not show that Abraham suffered very much, he lost almost everything. Is this all the Christian life is? If it is, then the Christian life is only a life of losses. The matter of loss is just one aspect of the Christian life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29562" data-verses="Romans 5:2">Romans 5:2</span> does not say, “We have access into this loss in which we stand.” No, it says, “We have the access by faith into this grace in which we stand.” God has no intention of keeping us in loss. His intention is to bring us into grace, into the enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_LUvGUOBYw3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj"> God wants to bring us into the enjoyment of grace, but there is a frustration to this grace—the self. We ourselves are the frustration. Although Christ has come and grace has come with Him, and although we have been brought into the grace in which we stand, the greatest frustration to this grace is you and I. Hence, before we can have the experience of Isaac, we need Abraham who represents the first aspect of the experience of life. Abraham’s life reveals that if we would enjoy God’s grace and have the full enjoyment of God’s riches, we must be dealt with, circumcised, and cut off. If Abraham had not been circumcised, Isaac would never have been born. Isaac came after Abraham’s circumcision. After Abraham was circumcised in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29563" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Genesis 17</span>, God told him that Isaac would be born (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29564" data-verses="Genesis 17:19">17:19</span>). Eventually, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29565" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span>, Isaac was born. Isaac came with God’s visitation. He was born by God’s visitation. God’s visitation equals the birth of Isaac. God visited Sarah and that visitation became the birth of Isaac. This is grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="NgrUOPst9ndCGqPDKS1sPHM-5DPRKLEkyN_8bfWBSPyO-5g1-dnym0-8I86wUsKBc"> God has come to be enjoyed by His called ones. But if we would have this enjoyment, the self must go. Once the self has gone, Isaac comes. This means that grace comes. It is not easy to lose the self. In order for the self to go, we must suffer loss. Are you willing to lose yourself? I do not believe that anyone is willing to lose himself. Nevertheless, we must lose ourselves before grace can come. To lose the self is to lose our <span class="pg" data-page-id="826" id="826">[826]</span> face. When we keep our face we lose grace. If we want to receive grace, we must lose our face. Brothers, as you deal with your wife in your daily living, you must be prepared to lose yourself. If you do this, grace will come. After Abraham was circumcised, Isaac came. This is the principle. With us, the self must go and then grace will come. We must firstly be Abraham and then we become Isaac. </p>
<p data-content-id="topU0NZPOs7b25ters3Gd4mRK2iJhSqSpV5hz_XoXr_MU93J_kJdBBom0evJv9lGi"> It was not easy for Abraham to lose himself. In a good sense, God forced him to lose himself. When God called Abraham, He did not say, “Abraham, you must lose yourself and then I will come in to be your grace and enjoyment.” No, when God called him, He promised to bless him. The blessing in the Old Testament somewhat equals the grace in the New Testament. What is the difference between blessing and grace? When God gives us something free, that is a blessing. But when this blessing is wrought into our being, it becomes grace. God promised Abraham that He would bless him. When the blessing was wrought into Abraham, it became grace. Abraham’s self and natural man were the strongest frustration to God’s blessing and forced God to deal with him. </p>

In the New Testament we have the revelation of the experience of life, but we do not have as clear a picture of it as we have in the Old Testament. We are all familiar with the proverb which says that a picture is better than a thousand words. Although we have spent many years considering the experience of life as revealed in the New Testament, we cannot be certain about it only by the words in the New Testament. We also need the pictures in the Old Testament. By the Lord’s mercy, we have seen through the years that all the stories in the Old Testament depict the various aspects of the experience of life. Deep within, I feel that the Lord has shown us the full picture and has enabled us to understand its real significance. </p>
<p data-content-id="R_GfdTPWaEiXNNW82-yDaWlrDgqGLG6UWYb4K416h7Rart6vExDqqOyU38XwPBejO"> As we have already pointed out, there are three aspects to every Christian’s experience of life—the aspect of Abraham, the aspect of Isaac, and the aspect of Jacob. If we did not have this clear view, we would only consider Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as three separate individuals. But, after receiving the revelation and understanding it in the light of the New Testament, we realize that these three men are not three separate individuals, but three aspects of one complete person in the experience of life. Some, finding it difficult to believe that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob represent three aspects of one complete person, may say, “How can you say that Abraham is not a complete person? Abraham is just Abraham, and the same is true for both Isaac and Jacob.” If you do not believe that these three people are three aspects of the complete experience of one person, I would ask you this <span class="pg" data-page-id="836" id="836">[836]</span> question: Can you see God’s selection in Abraham? The first item in our experience of God is His selection, His choice, which was made before the foundation of the world. We see this clearly in the New Testament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29606" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4">Eph. 1:4</span>), but we cannot see it in the experience of Abraham. Thus, as far as God’s selection is concerned, Abraham needs someone else to perfect him. The selection which we cannot find in Abraham’s life is revealed in Jacob’s. In addition to being selected, we Christians are also called. In Isaac we see neither selection nor calling. Hence, in himself, Isaac is not complete. Isaac’s calling is in Abraham just as Abraham’s selection is in Jacob. By these two examples we should all be convinced that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob depict three aspects of one complete person in the experience of life. In a sense, we are all Abrahams, for we have been called and have learned to live by faith in God and in fellowship with Him. Since we have also been put into the position of grace, we are also Isaacs. As we shall see in later messages, we are Jacobs as well. </p>
<p data-content-id="sHB9QAVlSM3v0XjManno-ngsrnz_fHA5fTkqfQSTHo75EQs1z1Iu7LXCJgPqSPnNs"> The aspect of Isaac unfolds the matter of grace. We have not only been called and have learned to live by faith in God and in fellowship with Him, but we are daily enjoying something of God. If we do not have any enjoyment in our Christian life, we will not be able to live the Christian life. Rather, we would be very miserable. Praise the Lord that we not only have the aspect of Abraham but also the aspect of Isaac, which is the aspect of grace. Grace simply means the enjoyment of God. It is God Himself becoming our enjoyment in our spirit. Many times we have difficulties which trouble us mentally and emotionally. Nevertheless, while we are suffering in our mind and emotion, there is a sweet sense deep within our spirit. It seems that if we did not have this suffering, we would not have this enjoyment. The Christian suffering brings us the Christian enjoyment. From the moment we called on the name of the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Savior, we began to have these two aspects in our experience. Perhaps the very night you received the Lord Jesus your wife gave you a difficult time, disagreeing with your becoming a Christian and calling it silly. She immediately began to persecute you, and you <span class="pg" data-page-id="837" id="837">[837]</span> suffered in your mind, emotion, and senses. But while you were suffering, deep within you sensed something sweet which caused you to be happy. Thus, even at the beginning of your Christian life you had both the aspect of suffering, which is the aspect of Abraham, and the aspect of enjoyment, which is the aspect of Isaac. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XQ6JfdoPkw1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW">b. Resting and Enjoying</h2><p data-content-id="LD01-v3um3NuLShGttlVirWCnUvsRg9jsTHcyuTXlEDKbBHncuqREEkOSwGaFv9xn"> In the previous message we saw that Isaac inherited grace. With him, everything was a matter of grace. He was born in grace, was grown up in grace, and was made an heir of grace. In this message we need to see that with Isaac there was also the matter of enjoyment. His life was a resting and enjoying life. The record of Isaac’s life does not indicate that he suffered much. Rather, it reveals that he was always resting. This is proved by his meditating in the field (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29607" data-verses="Genesis 24:63">24:63</span>). Could Isaac have meditated if he had not been quiet and restful? No. In order to meditate we must be restful. Whenever we are troubled, we are unable to rest. Isaac was always resting. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29608" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">Genesis 24</span>, he had lost his mother, did not have a wife, and his servant had gone away from him. Yet, he was not troubled. He went to the field to meditate, not to cry out to the Lord. He did not say, “O Lord, what should I do? I have lost my mother, I do not have a wife, and my servant has gone away. Lord, have mercy upon me!” Isaac did not cry out in that way. Instead, he meditated. </p>
<p data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD0WeJ0APfiWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP"> Although we cannot find the word resting in the record of Isaac’s life, the fact is there nonetheless. Isaac was a very restful person. In spite of the troubles he encountered with the Philistines over the wells, he was always at rest. Although Isaac faced some troubles, he himself was not troubled. While the Philistines were contending for the wells, he remained restful. Isaac seemed to be saying, “If you don’t want me to stay here at this well, then I’ll go elsewhere. When you come to bother me there, I’ll go to still another place.” By this we see that Isaac was truly a restful person. Are you always restful? Consider your experience during the past twenty-four hours. Did anything bother you and cause you to lose your rest? Most of us would have to admit that we have been <span class="pg" data-page-id="838" id="838">[838]</span> troubled. This shows that although we are Isaacs, we are not always resting. Recently I was doing some difficult and exhausting work on the book of Revelation. But I can praise the Lord that as I was working, I was very restful and I could say, “I have nothing and I can do nothing. There is no need for me to do anything, because the Lord is doing it all.” We all need to be restful people. </p>
<p data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjJdcH8TpcGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD"> Isaac was not only resting; he was also enjoying. His entire life was a life of enjoyment. When he was old, he still had the taste for “savoury meat” and asked Esau to go out to the field and prepare him the meat which he loved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29609" data-verses="Genesis 27:1-4">27:1-4</span>). When Rebekah heard this, she called Jacob to fetch her two kids of the goats that she might prepare the meat for Isaac (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29610" data-verses="Genesis 27:5-10">27:5-10</span>). Eventually, after both Jacob and Esau had come with meat for their father, Isaac got a double portion. Esau, Rebekah, and Jacob were busy, but Isaac just sat there enjoying the meat. By this we see that Isaac was an enjoying person, always enjoying the provision of grace. This enjoyment was his destiny. </p>

Now we must see that with this grace-enjoying person there were still the natural weakness and the natural life. It is difficult for us to understand this point. According to our natural, religious concept, we always think that if we are natural, we cannot have the enjoyment of grace. According to our religious concept, the enjoyment of grace depends upon how spiritual we are. In our teachings and exhortations, especially to our relatives and children, we say that in order to enjoy the grace of God we must be good, and that if we are not good, we are through with God’s grace. Probably none of us has ever thought that participating in the grace of God does not depend upon our being spiritual. On the contrary, we all have thought that we must be spiritual in order to enjoy the grace of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_TwA1CeJgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> Isaac was a model, a pattern, of the enjoyment of God’s grace. In the whole Bible there is hardly another person who enjoyed grace as much as Isaac did. Throughout his entire life Isaac did nothing except enjoy the grace of God. His life was a grace-enjoying life. Nevertheless, in Isaac we see exactly the same natural weakness as we saw in Abraham. Furthermore, in Isaac we also see the natural life of Jacob. Like Jacob, Isaac lived in a natural way. Jacob loved his son Joseph according to his natural taste (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29632" data-verses="Genesis 37:3-4">37:3-4</span>), and this caused trouble in the family. Joseph’s brothers hated him because of his father’s partial love for him. Isaac also loved Esau partially, loving him because he was a skillful hunter and could obtain the <span class="pg" data-page-id="848" id="848">[848]</span> venison which Isaac loved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29633" data-verses="Genesis 25:27-28">25:27-28</span>). Thus, Esau was a father’s boy. By this we see that Isaac and Jacob were the same as far as the natural life is concerned. </p>
<p data-content-id="prNfLWZ9JdrW7yTc3YS3U-vL_rVmoK-lAf5XbjI5e4-Pr6RDr_aquY_gO4K9YJN2U"> If you say that Isaac did not cheat anyone, I would point out that his wife Rebekah was his cheating helper. In a sense, Isaac differed from Jacob in the matter of supplanting, but this gap was filled by Rebekah. Every wife is a part of her husband; she is her husband’s completion and perfection. Without Rebekah, Isaac probably would not have been an expert at cheating. But with Rebekah, he certainly became the same as Jacob. Jacob learned how to supplant from his supplanting mother, and his supplanting mother was the supplanting completion to his father Isaac. Therefore, in Isaac we see the natural life of Jacob. </p>
<p data-content-id="vGPkFtfe7Aen3iGIVhF4DdWzr5hhJoSKHjShQRi-Q6TFheMiOa11sXw6WrcmFYS61"> Isaac was a grace-enjoying person. According to our natural concept, a person who has a natural weakness and who lives in the natural life can never enjoy the grace of God. This is our concept; it is not God’s word. In the Bible, we cannot see that Isaac was very spiritual. He was a man who still had a natural weakness and who still lived in the natural life. Why then did he have such an enjoyment of God’s grace? Simply because God had ordained it that way. With us Christians, there is the aspect of God’s ordination. As we have already pointed out, it is our destiny to enjoy the grace of God. This destiny was preordained before the foundation of the world. Do not think that if you are spiritual, you are privileged to enjoy God’s grace and that if you are not spiritual, you cannot enjoy His grace. This is a religious concept, and the Bible does not teach this. After hearing that enjoying grace does not depend upon our being spiritual, some may say, “If we don’t need to be spiritual to enjoy God’s grace, then let us be unspiritual.” Do not say this. Neither being spiritual nor being unspiritual will help us to enjoy God’s grace. It is entirely a matter of God’s ordination, and it does not depend on what we are nor on what we can do. With us, there is the aspect of Isaac. We have been ordained by God to the enjoyment of grace. If we are spiritual, we shall not enjoy grace more, and if we are unspiritual we shall not miss the grace of God. But we should not say, “Let us do evil that good may <span class="pg" data-page-id="849" id="849">[849]</span> come.” Do not waste your time trying to be spiritual or trying to be unspiritual. Simply say, “O Lord, I worship You for Your ordination. You have ordained me to the enjoyment of grace.” At the least, we all are a part of Isaac. In our being there is the aspect of having been ordained by God to the enjoyment of His grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3OhlvT2bcrDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12"> When do you enjoy grace more—when you feel that you are spiritual and good in the eyes of God, or when you are down and feel that you are absolutely unworthy? I have enjoyed grace the most when I have been down. But we should not say, “Let us be down that we may enjoy grace the most.” If you try to do this, it will not work. Again I say that it does not depend upon us but upon God’s ordination. I hope that my word will encourage you neither to be spiritual nor to be unspiritual. Rather, I hope that it will encourage you to be nothing. But do not try to be nothing, for your trying is still something. If you could say, “I’ll go home and forget everything,” that would be wonderful. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQJFv6dSpG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> In the record of Isaac’s life we see a person who enjoyed God’s grace in every way. Do you believe that a man who had such an enjoyment of God’s grace could still have the natural weakness of lying in a substantial way? He lied in the way of sacrificing his wife. Perhaps we would say, “If I were such a person, I would never lie in that way.” Do not say this. We may enjoy even more grace and then lie more substantially than Isaac did. </p>
<p data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8AfonztgdHeuNK4c1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq"> Consider your experience. Although you have never lied in sacrificing your wife, you have lied substantially to your wife. In my early years, I was much affected by religious concepts, believing that Christians, especially the so-called spiritual Christians, would never lie. Eventually, I discovered that Christians, including the so-called spiritual ones, also lie. Not only the worldly people lie; the Christians and the spiritual people also lie. This is the condition of the fallen race. What then shall we do? We should not do anything. God has selected us out of this fallen race, and His ordination has come to us. This does not mean that when we behave ourselves or become spiritual in the eyes of God, we shall then receive more grace. Although Isaac never tried to behave <span class="pg" data-page-id="850" id="850">[850]</span> himself or to be spiritual, he continually enjoyed grace. I do not encourage you to be religious or to be unreligious. I do not encourage you to be anything, for the enjoyment of God’s grace does not depend upon our being spiritual. </p>
<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6u2b5kNlWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> Isaac wanted to bless his son Esau. However, he mixed the blessing with his natural taste. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29634" data-verses="Genesis 27:3-4">27:3 and 4</span>, Isaac said to Esau, “Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; and make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.” Isaac seemed to be saying, “Esau, before I die, I would like to eat venison one more time. If you get some venison for me, then I shall bless you.” Here we see that Isaac mixed up God’s blessing with his natural taste. Although we may wonder how such a person could bless others, Isaac did bless. </p>

Genesis gives us the record of nine great persons. The first five—Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, and Noah—are considered as five separate people. Although there was some spiritual relationship between them, strictly speaking, Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, and Noah have nothing to do with each other. However, when we come to the last four—Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph—we see that, as far as the experience of life is concerned, they should not be considered as four separate individuals. As we have pointed out, with Abraham we do not have the matter of selection. The first item in Abraham’s record is calling. But according to the New Testament revelation, the experience of God does not begin with God’s calling but with His selection. Firstly, God selected us; secondly, He predestinated us; and thirdly, He called us. After God’s calling, we have forgiveness, redemption, justification, regeneration, and God’s full salvation. In this we can see that with Abraham we do not have the beginning of the experience of God. The beginning is with Jacob, for in him we see God’s selection. In Jacob’s record, however, we do not find God’s calling. Therefore, we say once again that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob plus Joseph are not four separate persons; they are four aspects of one complete experience in life. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph each represent an aspect of the experience of life. As we shall see, Jacob stands for the transformed life and Joseph represents the ruling aspect, the kingly aspect, of this transformed life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="860" id="860">[860]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6OaJaamr9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> According to the New Testament revelation, the believers were firstly chosen by God in eternity past before the foundation of the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29665" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4">Eph. 1:4</span>). Secondly, the believers were predestinated according to God’s selection. This also took place in eternity past. Then, in time, God called us. In God’s calling, which follows His predestination, we receive forgiveness, redemption, justification, regeneration, and full salvation. In addition to all this, we must be transformed. Day by day we are under the process of God’s transformation to be brought not only into the full sonship but also into the kingship. We were born sons of God, the royal sons, and we are undergoing the process of God’s transformation that in the future we might be kings. </p>
<p data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjJdUH9nBcGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD"> We do not see the kingship with either Abraham or Isaac. The kingship is with Joseph, who was a part of Jacob. When Jacob was welcomed in Egypt, apparently Pharaoh was the king over the world. Actually, the true reigning one was Joseph, not Pharaoh. But Joseph did not stand for himself; he stood for his father. Thus, at that time, the world was ruled by Jacob through Joseph. </p>
<p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qcmBIwbJdzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> All the saints are under the process of transformation in order to become kings. Hence, the proper, adequate, and complete experience of God goes from God’s selection to our kingship. Selection was accomplished in eternity past, and the kingship will be for eternity future. Kingship is our destiny. In eternity past, God selected and predestinated us to be kings in eternity future. With Abraham we see neither the selection in eternity past nor the kingship in eternity future. In other words, Abraham’s record has neither the beginning nor the ending of the experience of God, both of which are with Jacob. In Jacob’s record, we have a very good beginning and also an adequate ending. Jacob, the heel-holder, the supplanter, was transformed into a prince of God. Eventually, he became Israel and was no longer Jacob. If we read the New Testament carefully, we shall see that the name of Israel ultimately appears in the New Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29666" data-verses="Revelation 21:12">Rev. 21:12</span>). Although Israel is in the New Jerusalem, the names of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not found there. <span class="pg" data-page-id="861" id="861">[861]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="aGZQhn44RfDLbiYsGGvVETowVp6HKCGvuVmdAiPygWOGRgcCG0VL2WETay77K2O7o">4. The Third Aspect—the Experience of Jacob</h2><p data-content-id="bdPZiOYGTI0GDMWc0r7m5QP8NEaZCY4FzwTm0_1hM378LkILri-YBA6MHtvxUHmDQ"> Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph are a complete unit in the experience of life. We should not consider them as four separate individuals, but as four different aspects of one’s complete experience. Now we come to the third aspect—the aspect of Jacob. In Abraham, we have God’s calling, justification by faith, living by faith in God, and living in fellowship with God. In Isaac, we have the inheriting of grace and the resting and enjoying. In Isaac we do not see justification by faith, for that is covered in Abraham’s experience. But with Isaac we have the inheriting and enjoying of grace, which we do not see in Abraham’s record. In this we see the different aspects of the experience of life. In Jacob, we see God’s selection and God’s dealings. Although we all love to inherit and enjoy grace, we do not like the dealings. In Jacob, we do not see the aspect of enjoyment; rather, we see the aspect of God’s dealings. Because Jacob supplanted so much, God’s hand was always upon him. Jacob’s supplanting brought in God’s dealings. God might have said, “Jacob, you are able to supplant, but I am able to deal with you. In every step of your supplanting, My dealings will come in.” This was not God’s punishment; it was God’s dealings for the purpose of Jacob’s transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYQrM0VksNMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx"> As I was considering this message in the presence of the Lord, I laughed when I noticed that Jacob began to fight even before he was born. Rebekah had conceived and “the children struggled together within her” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29667" data-verses="Genesis 25:22">25:22</span>). This fighting was probably started by Jacob, not by Esau. Esau’s fighting must have been defensive. Jacob might have said, “Esau, you shouldn’t go ahead of me. I must be first.” Then Esau might have said, “No, I’m in front of you. I must get out first.” The two children were fighting, and the mother, being unable to tolerate it, inquired of the Lord concerning it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29668" data-verses="Genesis 25:22">25:22</span>). Under the sovereignty of God, Esau came out first, but Jacob did not stop striving. After he came out, he still took hold of Esau’s heel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29669" data-verses="Genesis 25:26">25:26</span>). Because of this, he was given the name of Jacob, which means heel-holder. Since Jacob was such a <span class="pg" data-page-id="862" id="862">[862]</span> heel-holder, God had to deal with him. The issue of God’s dealing was transformation. At a mature age, Jacob was no longer Jacob—he was Israel, a prince of God. Eventually, God put the whole world, including Pharaoh, under him. </p>
<p data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZhQ_rVFAp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6"> I say again that these four persons constitute a complete unit of the experience of God. We are all Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph. At present, we are still under the process of God’s transformation. But one day we shall all become Israels, the princes of God, ruling with our “Joseph” over all the world. </p>

Being Chosen</h2><p data-content-id="x52sBK0RPP8CO8qDhR2srqvOtnwO0DNKTmsXdJCAVgGjfw6s5s9H5KtPnduIvZkRU"> In Jacob, we see God’s selection, the matter of Jacob’s being chosen (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29670" data-verses="Genesis 25:21-26">25:21-26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29671" data-verses="1Peter 2:9">1 Pet. 2:9</span>). Do you believe that you have been chosen? How do you know this? Although we may stand on the Word of God and say, “I know that I have been chosen because the Bible tells me so,” I would still ask this question: how do we know from our experience that we have been chosen by God? We know it by the fact that we cannot get away from Him. During the past fifty years of my Christian life, I have tried many times to get away from the Lord. I have even said to Him, “Lord, I am tired of the Christian life. I am running away.” Although I tried to run away, I could not do it. While some Christian workers are afraid of your staying away from the Lord, I have the boldness to encourage you to stay away from Him. Try your best to do it, telling Him, “Lord, I don’t love You anymore. I’m through with being a Christian.” You may say this to the Lord, but He will reply, “Are you through with Me? It’s not up to you. You may be through, but I am not. Where shall you go—to Egypt? If you go there, I’ll go there to wait for you. When you get there, you will find that I’m already there.” We all have been trapped, and there is no escape. This is strong proof that we have been chosen by God. </p>

<p data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZhQ7rUBsp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6"> The book of Genesis contains the biographies of nine great persons: Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. The longest record is that of Jacob’s life, occupying nearly half of the book of Genesis. Why does the book of Genesis devote so many pages to this person? If you read Genesis carefully, you will see that Jacob’s record, unlike Abraham’s, includes many details. Enoch’s biography is less than half a chapter in length, and the biography of Enosh occupies only a few verses. Although Noah was an important person, Genesis does not give him very many pages. The reason Jacob’s record is so long is that in the experience of life nothing takes as long a time as transformation does. We were called in an instant, saved in a moment, and forgiven and regenerated in less than a minute. Transformation, however, requires our whole lifetime. Since the day we were saved, we have been undergoing the process of transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="BLE5KA_UJUWmNHemF8RznNCyeqoh0O1klPDPPz_cM4ETPjCdTs_KDy-6YMjsxBV2U"> In Abraham we see God’s calling and justification. In Isaac we see a person who was always enjoying God’s grace. It seems that Isaac did not want to know anything, nor exercise anything of himself. When Jacob deceived him, he knew that something was wrong, for he said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29699" data-verses="Genesis 27:22">27:22</span>). If I had been Isaac, I would have studied the matter for a long time before blessing anyone. Isaac doubted whether it was Esau. While Isaac knew the voices of his sons and distinctly heard Jacob’s voice, “he discerned him not” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29700" data-verses="Genesis 27:23">27:23</span>). This means that Isaac did not like to exercise his discernment. He was not lazy in eating, but he was idle in exercising his discernment. Not <span class="pg" data-page-id="872" id="872">[872]</span> much space in the book of Genesis is devoted to the aspect of Isaac. </p>

Being Dealt With</h2><p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2NBCIlGViDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> In Jacob we do not see God’s calling or justification; neither do we see the enjoyment of grace. Rather, we see how he was dealt with by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29701" data-verses="Genesis 25:19">25:19—32:21</span>). Even when Jacob was in his mother’s womb, God dealt with him. Throughout his life he was constantly under God’s dealing. God’s dealing was for his transformation. Jacob was born a supplanter, a heel holder. God’s intention, however, was to have a prince of God. How could such a supplanter become a prince of God? Only by transformation. It is easy to change a material building, but it is difficult to change a supplanter into a prince of God. This cannot be done overnight; it takes a lifetime. Because Jacob represents the aspect of transformation, he has such a long biography. </p>
<p data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQdCBHpsfFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29702" data-verses="Genesis 25:19-34">25:19-34</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29703" data-verses="Genesis 27:1-46">27:1-46</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29704" data-verses="Genesis 28:1-5">28:1-5</span>, we see four persons—Jacob, Esau, Isaac, and Rebekah—each of whom is distinct from the others. Although Jacob and Esau were twins, they were absolutely different from one another. “Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29705" data-verses="Genesis 25:27">25:27</span>, Heb.). Jacob was quiet, subtle, and crafty, and Esau was wild, rude, and physically strong. As Jacob and Esau were fighting in their mother’s womb, Esau won because of his strength. While Jacob was struggling to get out first, Esau seemed to say, “What are you doing? Let me go first.” Jacob was crafty in the mind, and Esau was strong in the body. When Esau learned that Jacob had cheated him, he threatened to kill him. Esau seemed to be saying, “Jacob, you have supplanted me. My mind cannot defeat your mind, but one day I will kill you.” In this we see that Jacob and Esau were absolutely different. </p>
<p data-content-id="sHB9QAVlSM3v0XjManno-nggrmHXfHA5fTkqfQSTHo75EQs1z1Iu7LXCJgPqSPnNs"> Isaac and Rebekah were also different from one another. Rebekah was clever, ingenious, skillful, and capable of manipulating the whole family. She both developed Jacob’s craftiness and directed her husband. Isaac was fully under Rebekah’s manipulation. As a result of her manipulation, both Esau and Isaac were supplanted. They were not only <span class="pg" data-page-id="873" id="873">[873]</span> supplanted by Jacob but also by Rebekah. When Isaac sent Jacob away, he might have thought that he initiated it. Actually, this was initiated by Rebekah. After she had spoken a few words to Isaac, he sent Jacob away to Laban (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29706" data-verses="Genesis 28:1-5">28:1-5</span>). Rebekah manipulated Isaac in this matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XQ6JTdprIw1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW"> Isaac, Rebekah, and Esau worked together for Jacob’s good. God used the three of them to transform Jacob. In this we see that all things work together for the good of those who are called by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29707" data-verses="Romans 8:28">Rom. 8:28</span>). Later we shall see that Laban as well as Jacob’s wives, maids, sons, and daughter were used by God to transform him. Every circumstance, situation, and person found in the record of Jacob’s life was used to transform this supplanter into a prince of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="LD01-v3um3NuLShGttlVirWOnW7MRg9jsTHcyuTXlEDKbBHncuqREEkOSwGaFv9xn"> We cannot find a story telling us as much about transformation as the story of Jacob does. Jacob had been chosen and predestinated. God’s purpose with this chosen one was to transform him into a prince of God. God does not like to transform good, simple, straight, honest, high-level people. He prefers to transform supplanters like Jacob. What kind of person are you? Are you good, straight, and honest, or are you a Jacob? We all, including the sisters, are Jacobs. Have you not supplanted others? Sisters, you have probably supplanted your mother, husband, and children. Some fathers-in-law have supplanted their sons-in-law, and some uncles have supplanted their nephews. Do not think that you are so good. I do not consider myself to be good like Abraham or Isaac. No, I think of myself as a Jacob. Knowing that we are Jacobs should be an encouragement to us. Do not say, “Oh, I’m so bad and low. I’m not a high-level person.” If you are like this, praise the Lord. You are the right person to know God’s mercy and grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD0WeF0CL7iWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP"> God has not chosen the good people. If we had made the choice, probably all of us would have chosen Esau instead of Jacob. Comparatively speaking, Esau was better than Jacob. He never cheated or supplanted anyone. But God did not choose Esau; He chose Jacob. Everyone who has been chosen by God is a naughty one. If you are good, then you must not be chosen by God. While Abraham is the example of justification by faith, Jacob is the example of being chosen. Have you been <span class="pg" data-page-id="874" id="874">[874]</span> chosen? Then you must be a Jacob, because God only chooses Jacobs. God is God, and we must worship Him as God. He has sovereignly chosen Jacob, the one who was such a supplanter. </p>

When Jacob and Esau were in their mother’s womb, they fought over who would be born first (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29708" data-verses="Genesis 25:22-26">25:22-26</span>). Jacob was subtle and seemed to be saying, “We are both in the womb. Whoever gets out first will be the firstborn and have the birthright. I must not lose the birthright.” Thus, Jacob began to fight. Under God’s sovereignty, Jacob had a smart mind, but he did not have much physical strength. Esau, on the contrary, was not so intelligent, but he was physically strong and defeated his brother, not allowing him to be born first. Although Esau suffered the cheating of Jacob’s mind, Jacob was defeated by Esau’s strength. If Jacob had had both a smart mind and great physical strength, Esau could not have done anything and Jacob could have had whatever he wanted. But God was very wise and seemed to say, “Jacob, I’ll let you have a smart mind, but I will not give you much physical strength. Your brother may be dull, but I shall make him stronger than you. You will have a smart mind, and he will have a strong body.” Thus, even before he was born, Jacob was defeated by Esau and was born the second. </p>
<p data-content-id="FyrUURSenH7AUUlr0ndgcvscHmHOvlth22OadvBKOnc_QUvWSaFJlMIPAfMT2Bdu2"> Although Jacob was defeated, he would not admit that he had been defeated. Instead, he held on to Esau’s heel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29709" data-verses="Genesis 25:26">25:26</span>), indicating that he refused to admit defeat. The same is true with us. Many times we are defeated by our Esau, but we do not admit it and still hold on to his heel. Sometimes the sisters are defeated by their husbands, but, refusing to admit defeat, they hold on to the husband’s heel. At other times, the husbands are defeated by their wives and they become the heel holders. Perhaps even today you have had such an experience. We all are Jacobs. God has chosen us, and we are under His dealing hand. </p>

Although we are all familiar with the story of Jacob’s dream, I doubt that we know the true significance of it. If we would know the significance of this dream, we must understand why Jacob had it where and when he did. Why did he not have this dream when he was at home with his parents? Once we find the answer to this question, we shall see what this dream means to us all. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYgxJ4sf065oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa">a) Wandering on His Lonesome Journey</h2><p data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0ZKz1YqG8onn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF"> Jacob had this dream while he was wandering on his lonesome journey (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29724" data-verses="Genesis 28:10">28:10</span>). Jacob had been born into a very good family. He had an excellent father, a loving mother, and an interesting brother. Before the foundation of the world, God chose and predestinated him to have the birthright. In the story of Jacob we see God’s intention and man’s desire. God intended that Jacob be the first, and Jacob also desired to be the first, not the second. Thus, Jacob’s desire corresponded to God’s intention. This indicates that if we have a desire which corresponds with God’s intention, then that desire must originate with God and not with ourselves. God intends to give us the birthright, and we also desire to be the first. This desire is not wrong; it is absolutely right. However, we must learn the lesson of not exercising our natural ability and our natural strength to fulfill God’s intention and to <span class="pg" data-page-id="882" id="882">[882]</span> satisfy our desire. Our natural strength and ability present a problem. </p>
<p data-content-id="YWQf39oOaKT-w18LKhlsjoNgn-gsDjHh52RJBmzJk0PH2LSkAzFUEZelzC01-ioTH"> By reading the book of Genesis along with the whole Bible, we see that God intended to give the birthright to Jacob and that Jacob desired to get it. However, Jacob’s natural strength had to be dealt with. Therefore, God sovereignly caused him to be the second. Although God had chosen him to be the first, God caused him to be born the second that Jacob might learn that his natural man was altogether unworthy and had to be cut off. God wants to give us the birthright, but our natural man is unqualified for it. We need to be transformed. Because God knew that Jacob needed transformation, He made him number two instead of number one. Without such a sovereign arrangement, Jacob’s natural man and natural strength would never have been exposed. If God had put Jacob ahead of Esau, Jacob might have thought that he was very spiritual. He would not have struggled, because he would already have been the first. But God knew what was in Jacob and He put Esau first that Jacob’s natural man might be exposed. Even while he was still in his mother’s womb, Jacob struggled to come out first. This was God’s arrangement. </p>
<p data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKQgC0n3g_CaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI"> Whatever happens to us is according to God’s arrangement. Do not think that you are too small to be worthy of such a sovereign arrangement. God has a purpose for us—to give us the birthright. Since our natural man is not qualified for this, God must transform us. He does not do this simply by His creating hand, but by a long process which can only be carried out through all the circumstances of life. As we have seen, God used Isaac, Rebekah, and Esau to deal with Jacob. Although these three people never held a conference to discuss how to deal with Jacob, they nevertheless worked in a good coordination for this purpose, because everything was under God’s sovereign hand. God arranged for Esau to be born first. He also arranged for Esau to be physically strong but not to be skillful in exercising his mind. Although he could not exercise his mind very well, he could exercise his physical strength to defeat Jacob. Furthermore, God arranged for Jacob to have a father who only knew to eat and enjoy. Even when Isaac realized that something was wrong when <span class="pg" data-page-id="883" id="883">[883]</span> Jacob came to him disguised as Esau, he only cared for his eating. This was the reason that he had become blind. While Isaac was neutral, Rebekah, who was very clever, was partial, very much favoring her beloved son Jacob. These three persons worked together to cause Jacob to leave his loving mother and his father’s home and to become a lonesome wanderer. </p>
<p data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnDHU81SPEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB"> In ancient times it was a great thing to travel from Beer-sheba to where Laban lived. It was not a small matter for Jacob to leave his mother, father, and the environment in which he had been raised and to take such a long journey. Having become a lonesome wanderer, he must have suffered a great deal on this journey. </p>
<p data-content-id="4ih-7ivO1f_Uex_xN1d2zJ9NdJq1CD7MrPWGnia394uU8LdMUmJUsII4OLzctGMcQ"> If you consider your past with the proper understanding, you will realize that your experience was exactly the same as Jacob’s. Not many of us were saved when we were in a good home under our loving mother’s care. Most of us were saved when we were lonesome and had been forced to suffer. Some had lost their mother, father, fiancée, wife, husband, or children and had become lonesome. In principle, at the time many of us were saved, we were suffering and lonesome. During the years in which we were under the care of our loving mother, the heavenly dream did not come. When did the first dream from heaven come to you? We all have had such a dream. The first dream of our spiritual life was our salvation. As we shall see, every spiritual vision is a dream. In what kind of situation were you when you had your first dream? As many of us can testify, our circumstances were not at all pleasant. Some were suffering, others were lonely, and still others were in an unpleasant environment. We had been forced to suffer, to wander, and to become lonesome. When, according to our consciousness, we had lost everything on earth and we were suffering and were lonely, the first heavenly dream came to us. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="oojwSJGvLbmiYj5tIQGoqYQ0H5Pc4PdhX0jmIOM9tm0WtyG5HMI5sjMdIyAZ1hq_3">b) Sleeping Homelessly with a Stone as His Pillow</h2><p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQbo0RrmREHTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> Speaking of Jacob, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29725" data-verses="Genesis 28:11">Genesis 28:11</span> says, “He lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took one of the stones of that place, and made it <span class="pg" data-page-id="884" id="884">[884]</span> his pillow, and lay down in that place to sleep” (Heb.). Jacob was in the wilderness and had no lodging place. Needing something on which to rest his head as he slept, he took a stone and made it his pillow. What is the meaning of this? It means that all human doing had been put away. There was no house, no lodging, nor anything made by man. Everything there in that place was God’s work. When Jacob was at home, the situation was very different. There everything was made by man. But that night in the wilderness, there was nothing man-made. Everything in that environment had been made by God. If you examine your past experience, you will see that the first dream of your spiritual life came at a time when nearly everything man-made had been crossed out and put aside. All that remained was the heaven and the earth created by God. When Jacob lived at home, he could lodge in a man-made dwelling and rest on a man-made pillow. But in the wilderness he had to rest on a God-created stone. </p>
<p data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYgxJ4seQG5oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa"> If I had been Jacob, I would have been more clever, using either wood or clay instead of stone. I do not think that I could have rested on a stone. But Jacob did not use either wood or clay. As we shall see, it is very meaningful that he used a stone for a pillow. If you had been Jacob, would you have used clay or stone? I would have made a pillow out of clay and rested my head upon it. But this would have been something man-made. The stone which Jacob used for a pillow, on the contrary, was something created and prepared by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0ZKz1YoSMonn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF"> As nearly all the called ones can testify, before they were saved, they were forced to suffer, to be lonesome, and to be in an environment in which everything man-made had become nothing. According to their understanding, everything man-made was useless, and they trusted in God’s creation, in the things made by God. It was at such a time that the dream from heaven came. </p>

<p data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_LUvuUPF0w3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29733" data-verses="Genesis 28:10-22">Genesis 28:10-22</span> is the most crucial word in the revelation of God. If we know the Bible, we shall realize that here there is a radical turn, a new start, in the divine revelation. In the first twenty-seven chapters of Genesis, the term the house of God (Bethel in Hebrew) is not used. But in this chapter, the matter of God’s house is revealed. The house of God is not merely a place; it is a living composition of living people. Where these people are, there the house of God is also. Hence, it does not depend upon the place but upon the people. If the people move, then the place where they once were is no longer God’s house. How can a place be called the house of God? Only because the real, living house of God, a living composition of living people, is there. </p>
<p data-content-id="NgrUOPst9ndCGqPDKS1sPHMW5C7xKLEkyN_8bfWBSPyO-5g1-dnym0-8I86wUsKBc"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29734" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> says that man was made in God’s own image. This is wonderful. Man is man; he is not God. Nevertheless, he has God’s image. In other words, man looks like God. It is correct to say this. If anyone has your image, he surely looks like you. It is very significant that God made man in His own image. </p>
<p data-content-id="topU0NZPOs7b25ters3Gd4m5K3GthSqSpV5hz_XoXr_MU93J_kJdBBom0evJv9lGi"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29735" data-verses="Genesis 2:7">2:7</span> we see that the man who was made in God’s image was constituted with dust. Do you realize that you were made with dust? No one is an exception. We were not made with gold, diamond, or steel; we all were made with dust. Is dust precious? Would you put a handful of dust into your pocket and keep it? No one would do this. Nevertheless, we were made out of dust. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29736" data-verses="Romans 9:21">Romans 9:21</span> reveals that we are clay vessels. Dust and clay are nearly the same. When water is added to dust, the dust becomes clay. According to our material constitution, we are not precious. <span class="pg" data-page-id="892" id="892">[892]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="h08U91ltZnqTUI0aV0g56mSGiKoCCw-cZTKHrVo12qTwS3OgmpjHqkUk9BKO83GId"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29737" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span> the term changes from dust to stone. The stone in this chapter becomes the rest for the man of dust (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29738" data-verses="Genesis 28:11">v. 11</span>), for the stone now holds the dust. It is quite meaningful that Jacob, a man of dust, rested upon a stone. Consider the picture in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29739" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span>. Here we see a tired, lonesome, disappointed, dusty man, a man who was not certain of his future. Needing some rest as the sun was going down, “he took one of the stones of that place, and made it his pillow, and lay down in that place to sleep” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29740" data-verses="Genesis 28:11">v. 11</span>, Heb.). The way to know the Bible is by the Bible. If we only read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29741" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">Genesis 28</span>, we shall not know what it means. But when we read the whole Bible with the heavenly light, we see the meaning of the stone in this chapter. When Peter first came to the Lord, the Lord changed his name saying, “You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which translated means a stone)” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29742" data-verses="John 1:42">John 1:42</span>). Approximately three years after this first meeting with the Lord, Peter, responding to a question asked by the Lord, said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29743" data-verses="Matthew 16:16">Matt. 16:16</span>). Then the Lord Jesus said to him, “I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29744" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matt. 16:18</span>). The Lord seemed to be saying, “Peter, do you remember that on the first day you came to Me I gave you the name stone? This should not merely be a name—it must be a fact. Peter, you are a stone. I shall build My church upon this rock.” Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29745" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> reveals that the stone is for the building of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWJRbBGs2tXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> What is the church? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29746" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">First Timothy 3:15</span> says that the church is the house of the living God. Ultimately, in eternity, the house of the living God will be the New Jerusalem. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29747" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span> we see that the New Jerusalem is not built with clay or dust but with precious stones. Speaking of the New Jerusalem, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29748" data-verses="Revelation 21:11">Revelation 21:11</span> says, “Her light was like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal.” This is not my allegorization; it is the divine revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KaYTFnRfTe1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> We need to look at the Bible with a bird’s-eye view. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29749" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span> we see that although man was made in the image of God, he was constituted with dust. While the image of God is for God’s expression, dust certainly is not suitable for the expression of God. Hence, there is the need for <span class="pg" data-page-id="893" id="893">[893]</span> transformation. Transformation is not merely a change in form; it is also a change in nature, for the word transformation denotes a metabolic change. We need to have a change in nature that our nature and appearance might no longer be that of dust. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29750" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> man is dusty, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29751" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span> he is precious stone. In eternity, there will be no need for cleaning. While we are on this dusty earth, we must clean every day. But because there will be no dust in the New Jerusalem, there will be no need to clean it. All the dust will be transformed into precious stones. </p>
<p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_Tww1DalgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29752" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we have a man of clay, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29753" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">Genesis 28</span> we see a man of clay resting upon a stone. The Bible is surely written by God. In no other book do we find a portion such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29754" data-verses="Genesis 28:10-22">28:10-22</span>. This passage is short, but it is crucial, deep, and meaningful, including the whole Bible in its scope. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29755" data-verses="Genesis 28:11">verse 11</span> we see the stone which Jacob used for a pillow. As everyone knows, a pillow is something upon which to rest. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29756" data-verses="Genesis 28:18">verse 18</span> this pillow-stone becomes a pillar. A pillow is for rest, but a pillar is used for support in a building. In the temple built by Solomon, there were two main pillars (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29757" data-verses="1Kings 7:21">1 Kings 7:21</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29758" data-verses="Galatians 2:9">Galatians 2:9</span> says that James, Peter, and John were pillars in the church. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29759" data-verses="Revelation 3:12">Revelation 3:12</span> says that the overcomers will be pillars in the temple of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29760" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">Genesis 28</span> we have the stone, the pillow, and the pillar. But this is not all. Eventually, this pillar becomes Bethel, the house of God. Moreover, in this short portion of the Word we see a ladder set up on the earth, the top of which reached to heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29761" data-verses="Genesis 28:12">v. 12</span>). It is impossible for any man to have written this record. How could Jacob have dreamed such a dream? According to human history, no one has ever had such a dream. But Jacob saw a ladder on which the angels of God were ascending and descending. This indicates that the angels were already there waiting for the time to ascend. When Jacob saw the ladder in his dream, the angels might have immediately ascended to heaven to report the news that Jacob had come and had seen the ladder. After Jacob had awakened out of his sleep, he realized that this place was not only the house of God but also the gate of heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29762" data-verses="Genesis 28:17">v. 17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="prNfLWZ9JdrW7yTc3YS3U-v7_qhGoK-lAf5XbjI5e4-Pr6RDr_aquY_gO4K9YJN2U"> In addition to all these wonderful items, there is another <span class="pg" data-page-id="894" id="894">[894]</span> important item in this chapter—the matter of our living. Many times when we preach the gospel, the sinners ask, “If I believe in Jesus, will He take care of my living?” Some saints ask a similar question: “If I love the Lord and live for Him, what will happen to my living? Don’t I need to take care of this?” We all have the problem of making a living. But in this short record we see that God takes care of our living. As we shall see, taking care of our living is secondary. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29763" data-verses="Genesis 28:15">verse 15</span> the Lord said to Jacob, “Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest.” Here the Lord seemed to be saying, “Jacob, I will be with you and I will take care of your living. I’ll give you bread to eat and raiment to put on.” This corresponds to the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29764" data-verses="Matthew 6:33">Matthew 6:33</span>: “Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.” If we seek His kingdom, God will surely take care of our living. </p>

<p data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXkVf5gMS0wrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip"> As we read Jacob’s record in the book of Genesis, we need to remember that the whole Bible is the word of life. The Bible contains teachings, stories, prophecies, and types, most of which apparently are unrelated to life. But since the whole Bible is the word of God as life, we should not consider the stories in the Bible as mere stories. We must look to the Lord that He might show us the life in all the stories. Most Christians have considered the stories in the book of Genesis merely as stories, neglecting the life found in them. When we were young, many of us enjoyed hearing the stories in the Bible. Undoubtedly, the stories in the Bible are the best. May the Lord give us a way to receive the nourishment of life in all the stories in the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LmZkuaBjKrZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> We have pointed out that as far as the experience of life is concerned, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph should not be considered as four separate individuals. In the experience of life, these four persons are one complete unit. In Abraham, we see God’s calling, justification by faith, living by faith in God, and living in fellowship with God. But in the experience of God there are not only God’s calling, justification, faith, and fellowship; we also have been selected and predestinated. In Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob we see various aspects of the experience of life. Only by putting these three people together with Joseph do we see the completion of the experience of life. We have seen that Jacob needs Joseph to complete him. The New Testament reveals clearly that we have been predestinated to be the sons of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29789" data-verses="Ephesians 1:5">Eph. 1:5</span>), even the royal sons of God. All God’s sons shall be kings. In the book of Revelation we are told that the saints will even be co-kings with Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="904" id="904">[904]</span> to rule over the nations in the kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29790" data-verses="Revelation 2:26-27">Rev. 2:26-27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29791" data-verses="Revelation 20:4">20:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29792" data-verses="Revelation 20:6">6</span>). We do not see the kingship in either Abraham or Isaac. Even if we look at Jacob himself we cannot see the kingship. It is clearly revealed in Joseph. During the time of the last chapters of Genesis, the whole world was under the reign of Pharaoh. Pharaoh, however, was merely a figurehead. The real ruler on earth at that time was Joseph. Since Joseph represented Jacob, the ruler over the earth was actually Jacob. Jacob ruled through his son Joseph who was the ruling aspect of Jacob’s life. Therefore, the experiences of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph constitute one complete experience of life. This experience of God begins with selection and consummates with kingship. </p>
<p data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtqJ2kiKPD_u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29793" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> reveals that God’s goal in His creation of man was for man to express Him in His image and to represent Him with His dominion. Although we see something of God in Abraham, we do not see in him very much of the image of God. Furthermore, in neither Abraham nor Isaac do we see God’s dominion. Even in Jacob himself we can barely see God’s dominion. God’s dominion is seen in Joseph. In Jacob with Joseph God’s image and dominion are clearly revealed. Eventually, Jacob was called Israel, the prince of God. His name includes God’s name. In the transformed name of Jacob we have the name of God. Because Jacob had truly been transformed into God’s image, in his being there was the expression of God. While Jacob had the expression, Joseph had the dominion. Hence, as one complete unit, they expressed God and represented Him. If we would see this, we must have spiritual enlightenment. We need to pray, saying, “Lord, open our eyes. We don’t just want to read the stories in the Bible and get knowledge from them. We want to see the light of life in these stories and be nourished by the life they contain.” </p>
<p data-content-id="6CXs4WE0BL6-B1B4FDiAFq5Mucj3zGKjTYJeRnGmeXBe72gXmUfpgBoC9qhDjO81n"> In Abraham we cannot see much of God’s dealing. Neither do we see God’s dealing in Isaac, for God never dealt with him. Isaac simply loved to eat. According to our opinion, none of us would agree with this, saying, “God, why do You deal with me all the time? Why didn’t You deal with Isaac? Isaac even sold Your blessing for savory meat.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29794" data-verses="Genesis 27:3-4">27:3 and 4</span>, <span class="pg" data-page-id="905" id="905">[905]</span> Isaac said to Esau, “Go out to the field, and take me some venison; and make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.” If a brother did this today, we would say, “Brother, you shouldn’t do this. This is too fleshly and worldly.” But Isaac was not rebuked for doing this. In fact, although Isaac blessed blindly and wrongly, God honored his blessing. This clearly indicates that Isaac does not represent the life which has been dealt with by God. Jacob’s life is the life which represents God’s dealings. Time after time, God did not let Jacob go. Instead, He kept His hand upon him. </p>
<p data-content-id="R_GfdTPWaEiXNNW82-yDaW17DjqGLG6UWYb4K416h7Rart6vExDqqOyU38XwPBejO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29795" data-verses="Genesis 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span>, Jacob, after coming to Laban’s home, was put into the transformation room. As we have seen, Isaac, Rebekah, and Esau worked together to force Jacob to escape from his home. Isaac was simple, easygoing, and not disposed to exercise his discernment. This was his disposition and character. Rebekah, however, was clever, ingenious, and manipulative. Being a strong wife and mother, she manipulated the whole family. Esau, the brother, was not very intelligent, but he was physically strong and seemed to say, “Jacob, I don’t know how to exercise my mind as you do, but I do know how to exercise my fist. You may be smart, but one day I will kill you.” These three people worked together as a team to chase Jacob away, forcing him to leave his loving mother and his father’s home. We know that Jacob suffered on his journey by the fact that he “lifted up his voice and wept” when he saw his cousin Rachel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29796" data-verses="Genesis 29:11">29:11</span>). Jacob had been very lonesome. All that he had experienced prior to coming to Laban’s home was simply to bring him into the room of transformation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29797" data-verses="Genesis 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span>, Jacob was admitted to this room. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="E-xv1nlZl2LrnNkDtbmzOeYyduSStUIFb3C0mvDz1LtjokSWkphwKc-Ng-yoBiibt">5) God’s Sovereignty in Leading Jacob<br/>to Meet Rachel and Laban</h2><p data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2zSOOYwNY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df"> God sovereignly led Jacob to meet Rachel and Laban (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29798" data-verses="Genesis 29:1-14">29:1-14</span>). After traveling a very long distance, Jacob came to a certain place, supposing it to be the place where his uncle Laban lived. The Bible does not say that Jacob was groping for the right place, moving from one place to another. No, it <span class="pg" data-page-id="906" id="906">[906]</span> says that he came to just one place and that he immediately discovered that it was the place where Laban lived. After conversing briefly with some people at the well, Jacob met Rachel, his uncle Laban’s daughter. It was sovereign of God that Rachel came and not Leah. We know that this was God’s sovereign arrangement because in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29799" data-verses="Genesis 28:15">28:15</span> God promised Jacob, saying, “Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.” God was faithful and kept His word, regulating Jacob’s steps and bringing him to Laban’s dwelling place. Then God brought Rachel to meet Jacob at the well. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29800" data-verses="Genesis 24:13-32">24:13-32</span>, Rebekah and Laban were met by Isaac’s servant. Here Rachel and Laban are met by Jacob himself. In this we see God’s sovereignty. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ss-Kv9Ptsxb3Hpm3OLvQWSwS3WUZkwLJkPM-9Yo5gpNrugTwkZhE_qWQlLbkcq0fN"> We all are God’s chosen ones. If you believe that you are a chosen one of God, then you must believe that whatever happens to you is of God. Whatever happened to us in the past, or is taking place in the present, is of God. Never be discontented with your circumstances. As one of God’s chosen ones, your destiny is in God’s hand and your destination is under His direction. Your coming into the church life was not an accident. It was brought about by the hand of the God who has chosen you. Not only are we under God’s thumb; we are also in His hand. Whenever you are about to deal with something, you will hold it fast in your hand. Do not be afraid of being under God’s thumb, for this is a sign that you are in His hand. Simply say, “Praise the Lord! I’m under His thumb and in His hand.” As today’s Jacobs, we all are in God’s hand. </p>

<p data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9Bm7JhKEq6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr"> Jacob’s record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29843" data-verses="Genesis 30:1-2">Genesis 30 and 31</span> is very interesting. Based upon the two principles that the Bible contains no wasted words and that everything in the Bible is the word of life, we must look to the Lord that we might see the life in this record. I have spent a considerable amount of time in this section of the Word. Many years ago, I took this record merely as a story. But after realizing that whatever is found in the Bible is the word of life, I began to seek the life in this portion of the Word. After I was enlightened, I realized that this record is full of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="FyrUURSenH7AUUlr0ndgcv8EHnz-vlth22OadvBKOnc_QUvWSaFJlMIPAfMT2Bdu2"> All the main items in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29844" data-verses="Genesis 30:25-43">30:25-43</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29845" data-verses="Genesis 31:1-16">31:1-16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29846" data-verses="Genesis 31:38-42">38-42</span> can be classified under three headings: Laban’s squeeze, Jacob’s trick, and God’s blessing. The three main parties in this record are Laban, Jacob, and God. Two of these parties are visible and one is invisible. Laban, the first party, squeezed Jacob, and Jacob, the second party, tricked Laban. Neither of these two parties, however, could make the final decision. This was made by the third party, the invisible party, God Himself. However much Laban squeezed Jacob, Laban was bound to lose, and whatever tricks Jacob might have played on Laban, it was not Jacob’s tricks that made him rich. The last word was not spoken by Laban or Jacob; it was spoken by God, the Lord of all. If we would see the life in this section of the Word and receive the supply of life it contains, we must pay attention to these three parties. If we see them, we shall appreciate this section of the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="CAIiqFyjjgw0LbNxWLi5D8Ib-xSGcXq_WajUO0fMiI1qsIetqtq6bkTvknnO7bFYb"> As we have pointed out, Abraham represents a life justified by God and living in fellowship with God, and Isaac represents the life which enjoys God’s grace. In Jacob we see <span class="pg" data-page-id="916" id="916">[916]</span> the third aspect of the spiritual life—transformation. Jacob, a man under God’s transforming hand, represents the life of transformation. Laban’s squeezing of Jacob was sovereign of God. Jacob needed Laban’s squeezing hand, and God used it for Jacob’s transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KaYDlnTL7e1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> As you read the record of Jacob’s life, do not read it for others. Read it for yourself, for you are the unique Jacob. Even the sisters are Jacobs. While many sisters have Laban husbands, they, the tricky wives, are Jacobs. Since they are so tricky, God has given them husbands like Laban to squeeze them. However, we may also say that many Jacob husbands have married Laban wives. Nearly every husband is tricky. Although a certain married brother may appear to be a gentleman, he is actually a tricky Jacob. Every husband plays tricks on his wife. But however tricky we may be, God is sovereign. Jacob’s record is our biography and autobiography. The record in the Bible is our biography, and the record in our daily living is our autobiography. We are writing our autobiography day by day. In dealing with others, we are tricky; in suffering others’ dealings, we are squeezed. </p>
<p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_TgQ1BeJgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> Jacob had been chosen to be the expression of God. How could such a supplanter become God’s expression? Not by outward correction, but only through the process of transformation. How can transformation be accomplished? Only by our being placed, by God’s sovereign arrangement, into a certain environment and under the hand of certain people. He is sovereign in His arrangement of our environment. To the brothers and sisters who are soon to be married I would say this word: Brothers, do not think that you are about to marry a good sister. No, you will marry a squeezing Laban. Sisters, be prepared. You will not marry a spiritual giant but a tricky Jacob. God is sovereign in this matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-ytt1viAKBFlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo"> Although God has chosen us, we are supplanters, heelholders, and must be transformed, whether we like it or not. I have heard many among us saying, “Lord Jesus, I love You.” Do you know what it means to say this to the Lord? It means that you agree with His dealing. When you say, “Lord Jesus, I love You,” you are actually saying, “Lord Jesus, I’m one with You and I’m ready for You to deal with me.” Probably you have <span class="pg" data-page-id="917" id="917">[917]</span> not realized what is involved in saying, “Lord Jesus, I love You.” Suppose a young lady tells a young man that she loves him. This word involves a great deal and should not be spoken lightly. By speaking this simple word, she sells herself to him. Likewise, when we say, “O Lord Jesus, I love You,” we are caught by Him and we become involved in the process of transformation. As many of us can testify, we had no problems before we began to love the Lord. But since we began to say, “Lord Jesus, I love You,” we have had one problem after another. These problems, however, do not kill us. Sometimes we may be plagued with so many problems that we want to die. But at such a time the Lord will say, “You may want to die, but I will not let you die. I will keep you alive that you might be transformed. I did not predestinate you to die. I predestinated you to be conformed to the image of the Firstborn Son of God.” If we approach this portion of the Word in this light, we shall see how living it is. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXQ1TdfocO443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP">8) Laban’s Squeeze</h2><p data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkw-xWeNTuoPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU"> Let us now consider Laban’s squeeze (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29847" data-verses="Genesis 30:25-43">30:25-43</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29848" data-verses="Genesis 31:1-16">31:1-16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29849" data-verses="Genesis 31:38-42">38-42</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29850" data-verses="Genesis 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span> Laban received Jacob for hospitality (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29851" data-verses="Genesis 29:14">29:14</span>). After a while, Laban might have discovered that Jacob was quite smart and that he could be very profitable to him. Appearing to be kind, Laban said to Jacob, “Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29852" data-verses="Genesis 29:15">29:15</span>). Laban seemed to be saying, “Jacob, it is not fair for you to stay with me without being paid. Tell me what you want.” Laban might have perceived that Jacob had fallen in love with his daughter Rachel, and he might have said within himself, “Jacob, I will not let you have my daughter cheaply. You love her, and I will give her to you, but you must pay the price.” Laban was wise and did not say this to Jacob, but he knew Jacob’s heart. When Laban asked him about wages, Jacob said, “I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29853" data-verses="Genesis 29:18">29:18</span>). As we have pointed out, love blinds people and makes them foolish. Because his love for Rachel had made him foolish, Jacob pledged himself to work for seven years to get her. If I had been Jacob, I would not have worked longer than twelve <span class="pg" data-page-id="918" id="918">[918]</span> months. Laban was satisfied with Jacob’s offer. When these seven years were expired, however, Laban did nothing concerning Jacob’s marriage to Rachel. This shows that he had no heart. Thus, Jacob was forced to say, “Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29854" data-verses="Genesis 29:21">29:21</span>). But Laban gave Jacob Leah instead of Rachel. When Jacob realized this, Laban justified himself by saying that it was not the custom in their country to give the younger daughter before the firstborn (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29855" data-verses="Genesis 29:26">29:26</span>). Regarding Rachel, Laban said, “Fulfill her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29856" data-verses="Genesis 29:27">29:27</span>). Here we see Laban’s squeeze. If you recall your past, you will see that you also have been squeezed, perhaps by your husband or wife. </p>
<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6OKVabiP9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> Laban was crafty and cunning, and Jacob could not defeat him. Twice Jacob said that Laban had changed his wages ten times (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29857" data-verses="Genesis 31:7">31:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29858" data-verses="Genesis 31:41">41</span>). Jacob complained to Laban, saying, “Thus have I been twenty years in thy house: I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle; and thou hast changed my wages ten times” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29859" data-verses="Genesis 31:41">31:41</span>). Furthermore, Jacob said to him, “Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29860" data-verses="Genesis 31:42">31:42</span>). Jacob seemed to be saying, “Laban, not only have I worked fourteen years for your daughters and six years for your cattle, but you were not even willing to let me have my wives, children, and flocks. You have tried to detain them all.” What sufferings Jacob passed through under Laban’s squeezing hand! </p>

<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnmX9oK7svQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM">11) The Stone with Oil Poured upon It<br/>and the House of God</h2><p data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-ytt1vuAL1tlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo"> Jacob’s dream is the most crucial point in the whole book of Genesis (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29893" data-verses="Genesis 28:10-22">28:10-22</span>). Not even <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29894" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">1:26</span> is as crucial as Jacob’s dream in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29895" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span>. One of the most striking aspects of this dream is the stone. After traveling on a long journey, Jacob, being tired and lonesome, took a stone, made it his pillow, and slept in the open air. This might have been the first time in history that a man used a stone for a pillow. Have you ever laid your head upon a stone for rest? I have never done this. Firstly, Jacob made that stone a pillow; secondly, he set it up for a pillar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29896" data-verses="Genesis 28:18">28:18</span>). A pillow is for resting and a pillar is for building. Do you realize that one day your pillow will become a pillar? Later we shall see what this pillow is. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29897" data-verses="Genesis 28:22">28:22</span> Jacob said, “This stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house.” In addition to the stone, the pillar, and the house, there was the oil poured upon the top of the stone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29898" data-verses="Genesis 28:18">28:18</span>). How could Jacob, a lonesome wanderer, have had oil with him? I do not know. Nevertheless, early in the morning, he poured oil upon the stone. Hence, in this dream there are four basic elements: the stone, the pillar, the house, and the oil. These four items are the basic factors with which the Bible is composed. </p>
<p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXQ1TRfp4i443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> As we have mentioned several times, God’s intention is to make man His corporate expression. In the book of Genesis we cannot see that God obtained such an expression. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29899" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">1:26</span>, a declaration of God’s purpose in making man, we are told that man was made in the image of God. But here we do not see that God gained His expression. God did not have His <span class="pg" data-page-id="928" id="928">[928]</span> expression with Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, or Isaac. As we come to Jacob, we see that he was a supplanter, a heel-holder, a very crafty young man. Under the light of the whole Bible, we know that this young supplanter was chosen by God and was predestinated to have the birthright. Before the foundation of the world, in eternity past, God predestinated him to have the birthright. As we have pointed out, the birthright includes three things: expressing God as priests, representing Him as kings, and inheriting God’s inheritance as heirs. This birthright is absolutely for the corporate expression of God on earth. The events in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29900" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">Genesis 28</span> occurred approximately twenty-two centuries after the creation of man. God called Abraham approximately two thousand years after the creation of Adam, and the period of time from Abraham until Jacob was about two hundred years. During this long period of time, God did not obtain what He desired. </p>
<p data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkw-xaePHOoPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU"> While Jacob, the young supplanter who had gotten into trouble due to his supplanting, was on his lonesome journey, he had a dream. What Jacob saw was a dream; it was not yet a fact, because Jacob was still a supplanter. Deep within, he was probably still holding on to Esau’s heel. How could such a supplanter be the house of God? It was impossible. Hence, at that time, Jacob’s dream was only a dream. For example, although it is impossible for us to land on the moon right now, we may dream that we have landed on the moon. This may be a dream, but it is not a fact. We need to have dreams in our spiritual life. I have had a number of dreams in the past and I would like to have another one today. If you have had no dreams since you were saved, your situation must be most pitiful. How many dreams have you had since you were saved? Every spiritual vision is a dream. </p>
<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6OKZaZmr9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> What is the significance of a dream? The principle of a dream is that in it something impossible happens to you. Our being saved was a dream, the initial dream in our spiritual life. Although getting saved was an impossibility, we have been saved. Coming into the church life was also a spiritual dream. Everyone who has come into the church life has had a <span class="pg" data-page-id="929" id="929">[929]</span> dream in which something impossible took place. I like these heavenly dreams. </p>
<p data-content-id="h08U91ltZnqTUI0aV0g56mCqiI8qCw-cZTKHrVo12qTwS3OgmpjHqkUk9BKO83GId"> As we have seen in Jacob’s heavenly dream four things were revealed: the stone, the pillar, the house, and the oil. These four things are rarely found before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29901" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">Genesis 28</span>. For instance, apart from the onyx stone in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29902" data-verses="Genesis 2:12">2:12</span> no stone is mentioned in the foregoing twenty-seven and a half chapters. However, we do find mention of the bricks used for building the devilish city and demonic tower of Babel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29903" data-verses="Genesis 11:3">11:3</span>). When we were studying <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29904" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">chapter eleven</span>, we pointed out that bricks signify human work, the issue of human effort with clay. Every religion is represented by bricks, for every religion is a human effort with clay. Mankind is clay, and religion works upon mankind to produce bricks. No pillar is mentioned before Genesis twenty-eight. When the Bible speaks of the city and tower of Babel, no pillars are mentioned. Do not think that the Bible is common. It is not common; rather, it is unique. In the temple constructed by Solomon there were two great pillars (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29905" data-verses="1Kings 7:21">1 Kings 7:21</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29906" data-verses="Galatians 2:9">Galatians 2:9</span> we are told that Peter, James, and John were pillars of the church. Moreover, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29907" data-verses="Revelation 3:12">Revelation 3:12</span> we see that the overcomers will be built as pillars into the temple of God. Like the pillar, neither the house nor the oil is mentioned prior to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29908" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span>. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob all lived in tents. But after having his dream at Bethel, Jacob did not speak of a tent; he spoke of God’s house. </p>
<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWJB3BEoatXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> As we have pointed out elsewhere, in the Bible a stone is mainly for God’s building. When Peter first came to the Lord, the Lord changed his name from Simon to Cephas (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29909" data-verses="John 1:42">John 1:42</span>), saying, “You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which translated means a stone).” Approximately three years later, the Lord questioned His disciples, saying, “Who do men say that the Son of Man is?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29910" data-verses="Matthew 16:13">Matt. 16:13</span>). After Peter said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,” the Lord Jesus said to him, “I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29911" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matt. 16:18</span>). In saying this, the Lord reminded Peter of what He had done three years ago in changing his name from Simon to Cephas. Later, in writing his first Epistle, Peter said, “You <span class="pg" data-page-id="930" id="930">[930]</span> yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29912" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">1 Pet. 2:5</span>). In this one verse Peter mentions both the stone and the house. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29913" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span> Paul held a similar concept, telling the believers at Corinth that they were God’s building (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29914" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">1 Cor. 3:9</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29915" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:10">1 Corinthians 3:10</span> Paul tells us to take heed how we build. We must be careful of how and with what we build, for our work will be tested by fire. If we build with gold, silver, and precious stones, our work will remain. So we see, that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29916" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span> Paul also speaks of stone for God’s building. As we come to the book of Revelation, the ultimate end of the Bible, we see a city built up with precious stones. According to the principle of the Bible, a city is always the enlargement of a house. When a house is immensely enlarged, it becomes a city. There will be no temple in the New Jerusalem because the temple will have been enlarged into a city. That city will be an enlarged house built with precious stones. How consistent is the Bible! By all these portions of the Word, we see that stone is the material for the building of God’s house. </p>

Do you truly believe that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29939" data-verses="Genesis 31:1">Genesis 31</span>, the chapter which we shall consider in this message, is the breath of God? When I was young, I thought that surely every word and phrase in Ephesians was inspired by God, but I did not appreciate <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29940" data-verses="Genesis 31:1">Genesis 31</span> as much as I did Ephesians. Do you believe that the record in this chapter is the word of life? There is no mention of life in this chapter. Rather, there is the mention of the stealing of household images and of diplomatic talk. Is this the word of life? If we would see how <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29941" data-verses="Genesis 31:1">Genesis 31</span> is the word of life, we need to consider it along with the whole Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="8UouUokiSDmfQ5btvmO_u8yJcxyULW5y_xM7y0Cjh31lO6uhzd5IR1LXaUCBwG1Zr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29942" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">Genesis 28</span>, as Jacob was on his way to Laban’s home, he had a dream. The significance of that dream was that it revealed how God was desirous to have a house on earth and that His intention was to make His called one a stone, the material for His building. Is the Jacob revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29943" data-verses="Genesis 31:1">Genesis 31</span> the proper material for the building of God’s house? No, he was not a gentleman but a subtle man when he saw the dream. Do you believe that a subtle man like Jacob could become the precious material for the building of God’s house on earth? If you answer, “Yes,” it is because you know that you are the same as Jacob. We all are Jacobs. But the subtle Jacob is intended to be the material for the building of God’s house. This chapter reveals that through God’s dealings, such a subtle one can become the material for God’s dwelling place. This chapter continues the record of God’s dealings with His chosen one. Because this chapter gives us a view of God’s dealings with Jacob, it is surely the word of life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="938" id="938">[938]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="0JV8hDILxxkbeRl9MfljI5N3qwfFVL0iYCHdxKUekJ14F8oFrW_U5yl_qzhcrk_AB"> Jacob stayed with Laban for twenty years. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29944" data-verses="Genesis 31:7">31:7</span> Jacob said that Laban had changed his wages ten times. The number ten signifies the completion of a certain dealing. Jacob seemed to be saying, “Laban has not changed my wages nine times but ten times. He has dealt with me in a complete way.” The number twenty, which is double the number of completion, is composed of two times ten. God put Jacob under Laban’s hand for twenty years that Jacob might have a thorough dealing. But after those twenty years were over, we see in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29945" data-verses="Genesis 31:1">Genesis 31</span> that Jacob was still not a fully transformed person. We may find this disappointing, saying, “If the process of transformation cannot be completed in twenty years, then how long will it take? The Lord may come back before it has been accomplished.” However, if you compare the Jacob in this chapter with the Jacob in some of the earlier chapters, you will see that he certainly has experienced an amount of transformation. A great change has taken place in Jacob after spending twenty years with Laban. At the beginning of these twenty years, he was truly a supplanter, but at the end of that time, he was at least somewhat transformed. As we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29946" data-verses="Genesis 31:1">chapter thirty-one</span>, we see that the subtle Jacob has undergone a significant change. But although he has been somewhat transformed, in this chapter he is still quite natural. </p>
<p data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYQrcgVm4lMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx"> Perhaps you are wondering how this chapter reveals Jacob’s naturalness. Jacob was afraid of Laban, probably realizing that he could not defeat him. Jacob admitted that he was unable to do this. This is the reason that he fled from Laban, stealing away from him. If he had been bold, being assured that he could have defeated Laban, he would not have fled. Rather, he would have said, “Laban, you have treated me very badly. Now I am leaving you. Good-by!” But Jacob did not dare to do this. Instead, he stole away. As Laban was pursuing the departed Jacob, God spoke to him in a dream the night before he overtook Jacob, saying, “Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob from good to bad” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29947" data-verses="Genesis 31:24">v. 24</span>, Heb.). Laban was more subtle than Jacob, but this time God forced him to be honest. Laban even told Jacob of what God had spoken to him, saying, “It is in the power of my hand to do you <span class="pg" data-page-id="939" id="939">[939]</span> hurt; but the God of your fathers spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob from good to bad” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29948" data-verses="Genesis 31:29">v. 29</span>, Heb.). If I had been Laban, I would have never told Jacob of this. Nevertheless, Laban was foolish enough to speak of it. Then after upbraiding Laban for searching through his possessions, Jacob said, “God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of mine hands, and rebuked thee yesternight” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29949" data-verses="Genesis 31:42">v. 42</span>). Jacob seemed to be saying, “Laban, you have power in your hand, but I have God with me. Your power cannot defeat my God.” Because of what Laban had told him, Jacob became quite strong with him. This was a reaction of Jacob’s natural man. If Jacob had been truly spiritual, when Laban related his dream, he would simply have said, “Praise the Lord. O Lord, thank You.” Jacob could have said, “Laban, since the God of my father has spoken to you, there is no need for me to say anything. Praise Him!” But even if Jacob had said this much, he would have exposed the tail of his natural man. If not even the tail of the natural man remained, he would have said nothing except, “Praise the Lord, Uncle Laban.” And then he would have turned to the Lord, saying, “O Lord, I praise You. How I thank You that I am in Your hands.” After hearing how God had spoken to Laban, charging him not to do anything to Jacob, Jacob was emboldened to rebuke Laban to his face, pointing out how he had searched his stuff, had forced him to bear the loss of what was stolen, and had changed his wages ten times (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29950" data-verses="Genesis 31:36-41">vv. 36-41</span>). Jacob seemed to be saying, “See what you have done! I served you twenty years and you have changed my wages ten times. Now you have searched through all my things and have found nothing. What is the meaning of this?” Although this may appear to be frankness, it is the frankness of the natural man. Here Jacob is revealed not as a bad man or as a subtle man but as a natural man. This indicates that Jacob had not yet been fully transformed. </p>
<p data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZhArrXBsp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6"> Before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29951" data-verses="Genesis 32:1">chapter thirty-two</span>, there is no record that Jacob prayed. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29952" data-verses="Genesis 32:3-4">32:3-4</span> Jacob sent messengers to Esau, commanding them to address Esau as his lord. The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him” <span class="pg" data-page-id="940" id="940">[940]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29953" data-verses="Genesis 32:6">32:6</span>). When Jacob heard this news, he was afraid and prayed about it to the Lord. Fearing that Esau was planning to kill him and his family, Jacob was forced to pray. According to the record of Genesis, this is the first instance of Jacob’s praying. Before this, Jacob did not pray because he had always had his own way. When it came to fleeing from Laban, he used his skillful way, talking to his wives in a very convincing tone and persuading them to stand with him against their father. Unlike Esau, Jacob was not a good fighter, but he certainly was a good speaker. </p>
<p data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIITPKGwDfD0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs"> The record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29954" data-verses="Genesis 31:1">Genesis 31</span> exposes our own situation, giving us an accurate picture of what we are. This surely is the word of life. Although the word life is not mentioned in this chapter, the very life in the Gospel of John, the Gospel of life, is found here. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29955" data-verses="John 10:10">John 10:10</span> the Lord Jesus said, “I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly.” The way to have life abundantly is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29956" data-verses="Genesis 31:1">Genesis 31</span>, not in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29957" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29958" data-verses="Genesis 31:1">Genesis 31</span> is a revelation of our being. </p>

<p data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7WnbGekz93ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29985" data-verses="Genesis 32:1-2">Genesis 32 and 33</span> contain a very strange experience in the life of Jacob, the chosen one. We have already pointed out that Jacob did not trust in the Lord. Since the time he was born, he exercised his natural ability to do things for himself. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29986" data-verses="Genesis 31:1">chapter thirty-one</span> he fled from Laban, and God delivered him out of Laban’s usurping hand. Because Laban told him that God had warned him not to hurt Jacob, Jacob took the opportunity to boldly rebuke him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29987" data-verses="Genesis 31:24">31:24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29988" data-verses="Genesis 31:36">36</span>). Nevertheless, the Lord brought him through that difficulty. However, in front of Jacob was another serious problem—his brother Esau. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKQgSEn2UXCaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI">15) Jacob’s Fear of Esau</h2><p data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnDXk802jEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB"> Jacob was in a dilemma. Behind him was Laban and in front of him was Esau. I believe that while Jacob was fleeing from Laban and returning to the land of his fathers, he was greatly disturbed by these two men. It was difficult for him to remain with Laban and it was just as difficult for him to return to the place where Esau was. By God’s mercy, he was released from Laban, but now he had to confront Esau. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="4ih-7ivO1f_Uex_xN1d2zJt9dL-VCD7MrPWGnia394uU8LdMUmJUsII4OLzctGMcQ">a) Met by the Angels of God</h2><p data-content-id="oojwSJGvLbmiYj5tIQGoqYAEH7L44PdhX0jmIOM9tm0WtyG5HMI5sjMdIyAZ1hq_3"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29989" data-verses="Genesis 32:1-2">Genesis 32:1 and 2</span> say, “And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God’s camp: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim,” which means two camps (Heb.). As Jacob went on his way, he was probably thinking about how he would face his brother. Perhaps he said to himself, “I have been delivered from my uncle, but how shall I deal with Esau, my brother?” <span class="pg" data-page-id="950" id="950">[950]</span> Much to his surprise, the angels of God met him, indicating that they would protect him. God’s angels are always invisibly present with His chosen people. In this instance, the angels appeared to Jacob and he saw them. He did not see a small number of angels; rather, he saw two camps of them. This reminds us of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29990" data-verses="Psalms 34:7">Psalm 34:7</span>, which says, “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.” The presence of two camps of angels should have been a great encouragement to this troubled Jacob. However, he was still afraid that his brother would smite him. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LmZk-aAXirZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0">b) Still Trusting in Self-striving</h2><p data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtqJ20iLrv_u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m"> After Jacob saw the two camps of angels, he should have been comforted. Nevertheless, he did not trust in these two camps of angels. God’s purpose in showing him this vision of angels undoubtedly was to comfort him, to strengthen him, and to cause him to trust in God’s celestial armies. But Jacob did not put his trust in what he saw. Rather, Jacob, who still trusted in his self-striving (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29991" data-verses="Genesis 32:3-8">vv. 3-8</span>), imitated God’s two camps of angels by dividing his people into two camps. Instead of putting his trust in what he saw, he copied the technique. Although we can only guess at what Jacob was thinking when he did this (perhaps he thought that each of the two camps of his household would be protected by the two camps of the angels), one thing is clear—Jacob did not exercise trust in God nor in the vision of the angels; rather, he expended his time and energy in exercising his natural ability. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29992" data-verses="Genesis 32:7-8">Verses 7 and 8</span> say, “Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two camps; and said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.” This was Jacob’s cleverness. But actually it was not clever at all, for if Esau could have smitten the first camp of women and children, why could he not have also smitten the second camp? But this dividing of his people was the best that Jacob could do. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="6CXs4WE0BL6-B1B4FDiAFq5cue3XzGKjTYJeRnGmeXBe72gXmUfpgBoC9qhDjO81n">c) Also Calling on the Lord</h2><p data-content-id="R_GfdTPWaEiXNNW82-yDaW1rDhuiLG6UWYb4K416h7Rart6vExDqqOyU38XwPBejO"> After making these arrangements, Jacob probably was <span class="pg" data-page-id="951" id="951">[951]</span> still not at peace. Thus, he did something unusual—he prayed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29993" data-verses="Genesis 32:9-12">vv. 9-12</span>). This is the first record of Jacob’s praying in his entire life. (In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29994" data-verses="Genesis 28:20-22">28:20-22</span> it was his vow, not his prayer to God.) During the twenty years Jacob was under the squeezing hand of Laban, there is no record that he prayed. Although Laban changed his wages ten times, Jacob did not pray. In principle, we all are Jacobs. We have received the promise of God and we have come to know God, but still we do not pray. No matter what happens to us, we do not pray. Instead of exercising our spirit to pray, we exercise our mind to consider and our natural strength to face every problem. Jacob did not pray when he was with Laban; instead, he employed his natural strength to manage the situation. But now, being about to face Esau, he was brought to a place where he had no more skill. All his skill, technique, ability, and strength had been exhausted. When he learned that Esau was coming with four hundred men, he was frightened. The most he could do was divide his people into two groups, thinking that if the first were sacrificed, the second might be spared. Because this was the best Jacob could do, he was forced to pray. </p>
<p data-content-id="sHB9QAVlSM3v0XjManno-nwsrmHHfHA5fTkqfQSTHo75EQs1z1Iu7LXCJgPqSPnNs"> Jacob prayed a very good prayer. His prayer was much better than the prayers of most Christians today. Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="29995" data-verses="Genesis 32:9">v. 9</span>, Heb.). Here we see that Jacob prayed by holding on to the Lord’s word. The best way to pray is to take God’s word as the standing for your prayer. Jacob seemed to be saying, “Lord, didn’t You say that You would do me good? Now I stand on Your word and ask You to do something about it.” Although this verse seems to indicate that Jacob was quite experienced in prayer, there is no hint in the previous record that he prayed at all. </p>
<p data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XQ6ZfdprYw1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29996" data-verses="Genesis 32:10">verse 10</span> Jacob said, “I am smaller than all the lovingkindness and all the faithfulness which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two camps” (Heb.). I like Jacob’s expression here. He seemed to be saying, “Lord, my capacity is so small that it cannot contain all Your lovingkindness and faithfulness.” Here, Jacob was humble in <span class="pg" data-page-id="952" id="952">[952]</span> the presence of God, confessing that he was not worthy of God’s rich lovingkindness and faithfulness toward him and that he had passed over Jordan with just his staff, but that the Lord had increased him to two camps. Here we see a vivid picture of two camps in the heavens and of two camps on earth. Due to this, the chosen one should have been perfectly at peace. In the next verse Jacob continued, saying, “Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children.” Here we see Jacob’s fear of Esau. </p>
<p data-content-id="LD01-v3um3NuLShGttlVirGCnW7cRg9jsTHcyuTXlEDKbBHncuqREEkOSwGaFv9xn"> The high point of Jacob’s prayer is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="29997" data-verses="Genesis 32:12">verse 12</span>: “And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.” In this part of his prayer, Jacob touched God’s economy, for he spoke of the seed. To pray like this is not only to hold on to God’s word but also to touch His heart. God had chosen Jacob with the goal of having seed for the fulfillment of His purpose to have a corporate expression of Himself on earth. Jacob probably did not understand this, but he still prayed very well. As we study this prayer, we see that it was marvelous in every respect. I hope that we all shall pray like this. </p>

<p data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2zSaOZ0hY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30022" data-verses="Genesis 32:22-32">Genesis 32:22-32</span> relates a crucial experience in the life of Jacob, God’s chosen one. This is truly an extraordinary portion of the Holy Word. It is unique, and there is no other passage in the Bible that is similar to it. However, due to the lack of experience, most Christians have not paid adequate attention to this part of Scripture. By the Lord’s mercy, in this message we must consider this vital experience in Jacob’s life and be helped by it. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ss-Kv9Ptsxb3Hpm3OLvQWSwG3Xg5kwLJkPM-9Yo5gpNrugTwkZhE_qWQlLbkcq0fN"> Jacob’s experience in this chapter is very practical, personal, and intimate. What could be more intimate than wrestling with someone for at least half a night? The Lord in the form of man wrestled with Jacob “until the breaking of the day” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30023" data-verses="Genesis 32:24">v. 24</span>). The Lord God would never wrestle with a stranger or with an unbelieving sinner. Notice that we are not told that the man “came” to wrestle with Jacob. There is no verse which says, “While Jacob remained there alone considering his trouble, the Lord came to wrestle with him.” No, it simply says, “There wrestled a man with him,” indicating that the man was already there and that there was no need for him to come. This reveals that the Lord had been with Jacob all the time. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUDsBBjBPjRtaf2PAgd0RJGCJm6RKXdsQrQ3vEcVWKTvzkKR8PehPPTdnoCg5OrXo"> Why did the Lord suddenly begin to wrestle with Jacob? There certainly must have been a reason for it. It was due to Jacob’s background. As he was returning to his father’s land, he had two problems—Laban behind him and Esau in front of him. Having been released from the usurping hand of Laban, he was now desperate as he faced the coming confrontation with his brother, Esau. It was at this time that the wrestling took place. Jacob’s messengers had returned <span class="pg" data-page-id="962" id="962">[962]</span> with the report that Esau was coming to meet Jacob with four hundred men. When Jacob heard this report, he was terrified. According to Jacob’s understanding, if Esau was coming to welcome him, there would have been no need of the four hundred men. It seemed to him that Esau was like a captain coming with an army. Undoubtedly, Jacob thought that Esau was coming to smite him. Believing this, Jacob was forced to pray. After praying an excellent prayer, he divided his gift of cattle for Esau into nine droves. But he had no peace, because his problem was still directly in front of him. Therefore, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30024" data-verses="Genesis 32:22-23">verses 22 and 23</span> say, “He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.” After doing all this, Jacob was alone and was probably considering the situation further and wondering what to do in case Esau would attack him. Jacob’s burden was heavy, his situation was serious, and he was desperate. </p>
<p data-content-id="e4Tu7RSEEn956Bu43KIdFtdFelQZLhbqE99G8qhMhliWdoAMPEcx2IgxrawDytCgr"> The Bible gives no indication that Jacob prayed when he was alone. Many times, when you are not troubled, you pray, but when you are deeply troubled, you do not pray. The more you are troubled, the less you pray. Because the trouble is difficult and the situation serious, you simply cannot pray. Why? Because you have not yet been knocked down. No matter how serious the problem is, you have not been knocked down. Like Jacob, on the one hand we cannot go on, but on the other hand we do not pray. Rather, we remain there and ponder the situation, asking ourselves what to do. </p>
<p data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_LU_eUMF0w3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj"> While Jacob was considering how to cope with his problem, much to his surprise, a man began to wrestle with him. I say again that we are not told that the man came and wrestled with him. The text simply says, “There wrestled a man with him.” As we read this portion of the Word today, we immediately realize that this man was the Lord. But at the beginning of the wrestling, Jacob did not realize that the man was God. He might have thought that his assailant was one of Esau’s four hundred men. When this man began to wrestle with him, Jacob refused to let him prevail. Perhaps Jacob said <span class="pg" data-page-id="963" id="963">[963]</span> to himself, “This man has come to arrest me, but I will not let him do it.” </p>
<p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2NRKInS9iDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> At this point we need to ask four questions. First, why did the Lord as a man wrestle with Jacob? What was the need of this? When the Lord appeared to Abraham, He did so as the God of glory. But here we do not see that the Lord appeared to Jacob, but that He wrestled with him as a man. Second, why could the Lord, who is the Almighty, not prevail against Jacob, a little man? Third, why did the Lord wait so long before touching the hollow of Jacob’s thigh? Why did He not do it at the very beginning? The Lord must have wrestled with Jacob for at least six hours, perhaps beginning at midnight and continuing until dawn. Why did the Lord tolerate this wrestling for so long? And fourth, why did the Lord refuse to tell Jacob His name? On many other occasions, the Lord revealed His name to people, telling them who He was. But here, after being asked by Jacob to reveal His name, He declined to tell him, keeping His name a secret. Although I do not claim to be able to give a complete answer to all these questions, we can, through our experience, at least partially answer them. </p>
<p data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQdSJHrozFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B"> In this portion of the Word, we do not have an appearing of the God of glory; neither do we have a visitation from the Lord. To Abraham, the Lord firstly appeared as the God of glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30025" data-verses="Acts 7:2">Acts 7:2</span>). Later, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30026" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span>, the Lord visited him and shared a meal with him. But this experience of Jacob’s was neither an appearance of God nor a visitation from the Lord; it was a dealing. When you were saved, the Lord appeared to you, and many times after that you have had sweet and pleasant visitations of the Lord. But besides the Lord’s appearing at the time of our salvation and His visitation in moments of fellowship, there are times when the Lord deals with us. At the beginning of these dealings, we do not realize that the Lord is present. We think that our husband, our wife, or an elder is affording us a difficult time. Eventually, we realize that it is not a matter of our husband, our wife, or of one of the elders; it is God who is here dealing with us. </p>
<p data-content-id="QMSNPOcCBLw6v-EOydvwYElhIvozduX4YH5_O01lRUzkJdbjHu_x8PZ2HwO74uIjb"> This gives us the answer to the first question concerning the Lord’s wrestling with Jacob in the form of a man. God <span class="pg" data-page-id="964" id="964">[964]</span> does not deal with us in an apparent way, appearing as the God of glory. At the beginning of every dealing, we always think that some person is wrestling with us. Often, the wrestling lasts a long time. With Jacob, it might have been six hours, but with us, it may be six weeks, six months, or even six years. Sisters, how long have you been wrestling with your husband? Perhaps you wrestle with him every day. You realize that, as a Christian, there can be no separation or divorce. But you certainly feel free to exchange words with him. Perhaps you say to yourself, “It is unfortunate that I married this man. Since I cannot divorce him, I can at least argue with him.” Some wives have been wrestling with their husbands for a long time. The same, of course, is true with us husbands, for we also wrestle with our wives. With many of us, married life is a wrestling life. Although we may think that we are wrestling with our husband or wife, the other party is actually not our husband, our wife, an elder, or any circumstance, it is the Lord Himself who is wrestling with us. In our experience, we eventually realize that the Lord is here. For example, a sister may eventually say, “It is not my husband who is wrestling with me—it is the Lord.” </p>

Do you believe that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30049" data-verses="Genesis 34:1">Genesis 34</span>, the chapter which we shall consider in this message, is God-breathed? We need to look to the Lord that He would show us how this portion of the Word is the breath of God. When I was young, after I had read chapters like <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30050" data-verses="Genesis 34:1">Genesis 34</span> once or twice and the story had been fixed in my memory, I skipped over them. Whenever I came to this chapter in my reading of the Old Testament, I would remember that Jacob’s daughter was defiled and that his sons mercilessly killed people and plundered the city, and I passed over it. However, the Lord has shown us that even this chapter is the breath of life. Although there is life in this portion of the Word, it takes experience to appreciate it. </p>

After Breaking</h2><p data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8AfonztgdXSuM-Qc1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq"> In order to apprehend the life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30051" data-verses="Genesis 34:1">chapter thirty-four</span>, we must look both backward and forward. Prior to this chapter, Jacob had been delivered out of all his troubles. For twenty years, Jacob was retained under Laban’s squeezing hand, and he was very troubled by this. Eventually, it was impossible for Jacob to stay with Laban any longer and he left his uncle’s home. God had told Jacob that He wanted him to return to the land of his fathers. Jacob, however, could not forget what had happened there, for it was there that he had deceived his father Isaac and had supplanted his brother Esau. Although he was willing to return to the land of his fathers, he had to confront the great problem of facing his brother Esau. Nevertheless, taking the word of the Lord and utilizing his skill and cleverness, he stole away from Laban, not informing him that he was leaving. By stealing away from Laban, he <span class="pg" data-page-id="974" id="974">[974]</span> overcame his first difficulty, that of being under Laban’s squeezing hand. But then there was a second trouble: Laban pursued Jacob and finally caught up with him. But God intervened, telling Laban not to say anything either good or bad to Jacob. Thus, Jacob was wholly delivered from the hand of Laban. But the greatest trouble—facing Esau—still lay in front of him. Because of this, he had a long night of wrestling with an unidentified opponent who actually was the Lord Himself. But Jacob passed through this crisis, and the Lord delivered him from the problem with Esau. After this, Jacob had no more difficulties for a while. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6umX5lpJWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ">1) Having Only Returned to Shechem</h2><p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWjzN64v_gfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> After he had been delivered out of all these troubles, “Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30052" data-verses="Genesis 33:17">33:17</span>). Succoth was on the east side of the Jordan. This indicates that while Jacob was at Succoth, he had not yet crossed the Jordan River to enter into the heart of the land of Canaan. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30053" data-verses="Genesis 33:17">Genesis 33:17</span> does not say that Jacob came to Canaan. The land of Canaan is not mentioned until the next verse, where we are told that Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, “which is in the land of Canaan” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30054" data-verses="Genesis 33:18">v. 18</span>). In God’s eyes, when Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built himself a house there, he had not yet come back to the heart of the good land. By Jacob’s building a house for himself and booths for his cattle, we see how much Jacob was still natural and for himself. He certainly neglected the dream he had had at Bethel. After Jacob had fled from Esau, he had a dream in which he saw a ladder reaching from earth to heaven. When he awoke from that dream, he called the name of that place Bethel and poured oil upon the stone which he had used for a pillow, saying, “This stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30055" data-verses="Genesis 28:22">28:22</span>). At Bethel, Jacob made a vow to God, promising that the stone would be the house of God. In other words, he promised God that he would build a house for Him. Surely, Jacob forgot about this. If I had been there, I would have asked Jacob, “Jacob, why did you come back? Does God want you to build a house for yourself and booths for your cattle? What about the house of God?” When <span class="pg" data-page-id="975" id="975">[975]</span> Jacob was a stranger in a foreign land, we could sympathize with him, for it is difficult for anyone to be an alien. But now he has come back to the territory of the land of God’s promise. </p>
<p data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXkVfhgPS0wrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip"> If you read the Old Testament carefully, you will see that the territory east of the Jordan was never recognized as being the best part of the good land. But when the two and a half tribes of Israel came to this territory, they were attracted by it. This caused Moses to be unhappy with them. These two and a half tribes did receive this land, but they lost some of God’s blessing. When the Assyrians came to attack the children of Israel, they firstly came to the land east of the Jordan, and these two and a half tribes were the first to be captured (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30056" data-verses="1Chronicles 5:26">1 Chron. 5:26</span>). The strategic cities, such as Jerusalem and Bethlehem, are in the heart of the land west of the Jordan. Therefore, the territory east of the Jordan, where Succoth was, was not in the heart of the land of God’s promise. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROmKjtTljeOlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX"> The Bible affords us a very brief record of Jacob’s stay at Succoth. Eventually, Jacob realized that Succoth was not the proper place for him to stay with God, and he crossed over the Jordan and journeyed to Shechem. In his journey back to the good land, Jacob crossed three rivers: the Euphrates, the Jabbok, and the Jordan. In coming to Shechem, Jacob was following the footsteps of his forefather Abraham (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30057" data-verses="Genesis 12:5-6">12:5-6</span>). This indicates that Jacob had been brought on to the right track. In Shechem Jacob erected a tent and built an altar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30058" data-verses="Genesis 33:18-20">vv. 18-20</span>). This reveals that he had begun to live the tent life and to have the altar testimony. This was far better than building a house for himself and booths for his cattle. In Succoth Jacob built nothing for God. In Shechem, on the contrary, he built nothing for himself or for his cattle; rather, he built an altar for God and erected a tent for his living. How good it was that he not only followed the steps of his forefather, but also had the tent life and the altar testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9Bm7VhLAG6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr"> This was good, but it was not Bethel. If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30059" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">chapter twelve</span> you will see that after Abraham arrived at Shechem, he continued onward to Bethel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30060" data-verses="Genesis 12:6-8">12:6-8</span>). Jacob had his dream at Bethel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30061" data-verses="Genesis 28:10-22">28:10-22</span>). When he was told by the Lord to return to the land of his fathers, that was an indication that he should return to Bethel to fulfill his vow to build a house for <span class="pg" data-page-id="976" id="976">[976]</span> God. I simply cannot understand whether he forgot this dream or whether he was unwilling to pay the price. But he firstly came to Succoth and then continued onward to Shechem. In Shechem he began to live as a called one. Before then, Jacob never lived as a called one. Using today’s Christian terms, Jacob never lived the Christian life. Prior to that time, he was supplanting all the time. That was the life he had lived since birth. He supplanted others and held on to their heel. However, by the time Esau came to meet him, Jacob had been broken. Although Esau came to him with an honest and good heart, Jacob, even after he had been broken, was still supplanting. Supplanting until the very last minute, Jacob arrived safely at Shechem, where he began to live a tent life with an altar testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="FyrUURSenH7AUUlr0ndgcv8YHmHevlth22OadvBKOnc_QUvWSaFJlMIPAfMT2Bdu2"> Although Jacob had a tent with an altar in Shechem, this fell short of God’s standard. There was a tent for Jacob, but there was no house for God. An altar had been built for God, but God still did not have a house. According to the Old Testament, the building of the altar must bring us to the building of the temple. In the rebuilding of the temple, the first item to be recovered was the altar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30062" data-verses="Ezra 3:1-3">Ezra 3:1-3</span>). In front of both the tabernacle and the temple was the altar. It is the same in our experience. Firstly, we have an absolute consecration and build an altar; then we continue until we come to the building of the church, the house of God. </p>

<p data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XQ6ZTdovkw1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW"> The book of Revelation is the consummation of the Bible. If we did not have this book, the Bible would lack a proper conclusion. As a book of consummation, nearly everything in Revelation is something previously mentioned in the Old Testament. According to the black and white letters, we do not see anything related to God’s building in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30086" data-verses="Revelation 4:1-2">Revelation 4 and 5</span>. However, there is the matter of the seven eyes which are the seven Spirits of God. There is a secret to understanding the signs and symbols in the book of Revelation: whenever a symbol appears in this book, find where it is mentioned in the Old Testament. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30087" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation chapter one</span> we have the lampstands as a symbol of the churches. In order to understand the significance of the lampstands, we must read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30088" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span> where the lampstand is first mentioned, and also <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30089" data-verses="Zechariah 4:1">Zechariah 4</span> where it is mentioned the second time. In the same principle, if we would know what the seven eyes of God are, we must also go back to the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="LD01-v3um3NuLShGttlVirGOnXPsRg9jsTHcyuTXlEDKbBHncuqREEkOSwGaFv9xn"> The seven eyes are mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30090" data-verses="Zechariah 3:9">Zechariah 3:9 and 4:10</span>. Zechariah implies that these seven eyes, which are the seven lamps, are related to the Spirit. When Zechariah asked the angel, “What are these?” the angel answered, “This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30091" data-verses="Zechariah 4:4">Zech. 4:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30092" data-verses="Zechariah 4:6">6</span>). This word implies that the seven lamps are related to the Spirit of God. The book of Revelation tells us clearly that these seven eyes of God, which are the seven lamps, are the seven Spirits of God. Zechariah reveals that the seven eyes of <span class="pg" data-page-id="986" id="986">[986]</span> God, which are the seven lamps on the lampstand, are also the seven eyes of the stone. By means of the seven eyes, Christ as the Lion and the Lamb unveiled in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30093" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">Revelation 5</span> is connected to the stone spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30094" data-verses="Zechariah 3:1">Zechariah 3</span>. Therefore, the One with the seven eyes is not only the Lion-Lamb but also the stone. He is the Lion-Lamb-stone: the Lion to destroy the enemy, the Lamb to redeem us, and the stone to build God’s house. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD0WOF0DvfiWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP">THE GOAL OF GOD’S ECONOMY</h2><p data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROmKjpTn32OlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX"> God’s economy is not for salvation. Salvation is neither the goal nor the consummation of God’s economy. It is simply a procedure, a process, to reach God’s goal. God’s goal is the building of His eternal dwelling place. This building is the church today and the New Jerusalem in eternity. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9Bm7RhJEq6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr">CHRIST AS THE STONE FOR GOD’S BUILDING</h2><p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQboktrmRUHTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> Many Christians are familiar with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30095" data-verses="Acts 4:12">Acts 4:12</span>, which says, “And there is no salvation in any other; for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved.” I have used this verse many times in preaching the gospel. I boldly told people that only one name in the entire universe could save them. It was not the name of Confucius or Plato; it was the name of Jesus. In recent years I learned that the Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30096" data-verses="Acts 4:12">Acts 4:12</span> is the stone. The previous verse says, “This is the stone which was despised by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone.” If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30097" data-verses="Acts 4:10">Acts 4:10</span>, we shall see that this stone is clearly identified with Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Jesus Christ, the One who was crucified and raised from the dead, is the stone set at naught by the Jewish builders. He has become the head cornerstone, and there is salvation in no other one. Those who rejected Him not only rejected the Savior but also the building stone, even the head cornerstone. </p>
<p data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYgxZEseQW5oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa"> The cornerstone connects the walls of a building. In the corner of a building there are many stones, and among them is one called the head cornerstone. The Jews in ancient Palestine gave attention to three kinds of stones in building their houses: the foundation stone, the head cornerstone, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="987" id="987">[987]</span> the topstone. The building was laid upon the foundation stone, the sides of the building were joined by the head cornerstone, and on the roof was the topstone. These three stones held and protected the whole building. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30098" data-verses="Isaiah 28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span> Christ is the foundation stone, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30099" data-verses="Zechariah 4:7">Zechariah 4:7</span> He is the topstone, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30100" data-verses="Acts 4:10-12">Acts 4:10-12</span> He is the cornerstone. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30101" data-verses="Acts 4:1">Acts 4</span> Peter not only preached Christ as the Savior but also as the building stone, as the leading cornerstone that joins the walls together. Peter had this concept because he realized that God’s redemption in Christ is for His building. Thus, in his first Epistle Peter could say, “To whom coming, a living stone, having been rejected by men, but with God chosen, held in honor, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30102" data-verses="1Peter 2:4-5">1 Pet. 2:4-5</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0ZKjJYoSconn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF">GOD’S REDEMPTION BEING FOR HIS BUILDING</h2><p data-content-id="YWQf39oOaKT-w18LKhlsjodcn8kIDjHh52RJBmzJk0PH2LSkAzFUEZelzC01-ioTH"> Of all the gospel messages delivered today, hardly one is concerned with God’s building. The preaching of the gospel in Christianity certainly misses the mark. Because we are still under the influence of Christianity, we simply do not have the impression that God’s redemption in Christ is for the building. In the concept of many Christians, salvation is everything. A great many hymns praise the Lord as the Lamb, saying, “Worthy is the Lamb.” But there is hardly a hymn that says, “Worthy is the stone.” If you stood up in a meeting of Christians and praised Christ by saying, “Worthy is the stone,” they would think that you were crazy, or that you had taken in a peculiar concept. This is the situation today. However, in the Lord’s recovery the Lord has brought us on farther. We not only see, as Martin Luther saw, that the Christ is the Lamb for our redemption for us to be justified by faith in Him. We also see that this Lamb has seven eyes, which are also the seven eyes of the building stone. God’s economy is not for redemption; it is for His dwelling with man through redemption. Because man fell, there was the need for redemption. Redemption is the process by which fallen man is brought back to God for the fulfillment of God’s economy to build His dwelling place. But pitiful Christianity remains attached to the procedure, forgetting and neglecting God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="988" id="988">[988]</span> goal. Due to this, we must trumpet loudly the words, “Worthy is the stone.” </p>
<p data-content-id="E-xv1nlZl2LrnNkDtbmzOeYuduSCtUIFb3C0mvDz1LtjokSWkphwKc-Ng-yoBiibt"> Let us now consider some verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30103" data-verses="Matthew 21:1">Matthew 21</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30104" data-verses="Matthew 21:9">Verse 9</span> says, “And the crowds who went before Him and those who followed cried out, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest!” This verse, which was uttered in the warm welcome rendered to the Lord Jesus, is a quotation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30105" data-verses="Psalms 118:26">Psalm 118:26</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30106" data-verses="Psalms 118:26">Psalm 118:26</span> says, “Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord.” Who is the “he” mentioned in this verse? The answer is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30107" data-verses="Psalms 118:22">verse 22</span> of the same psalm: “The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30108" data-verses="Psalms 118:22-23">Verses 22 and 23</span> of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30109" data-verses="Psalms 118:1">Psalm 118</span> are quoted by the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30110" data-verses="Matthew 21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30111" data-verses="Psalms 118:23-24">Psalm 118:23 and 24</span> say, “This is the Lord’s doing; it is marvelous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.” The “day which the Lord hath made” is the day of resurrection. On the day of resurrection the Lord God made Jesus of Nazareth the cornerstone. This is the day the Lord has made and we should rejoice and be glad in it.

<p data-content-id="vGPkFtfe7Aen3iGIVhF4DdGHr5BhJoSKHjShQRi-Q6TFheMiOa11sXw6WrcmFYS61"> The Bible begins with God’s creation and ends with God’s habitation. We all need to be impressed with these two words—creation and habitation. The consummation of the Bible is God’s eternal dwelling place. If we would know the Bible, we must keep these two things, God’s creation and His habitation, firmly in mind. We have seen that the book of Genesis contains nearly all the seeds of the truths concerning God’s economy. Perhaps the last seed in this book is the seed of Bethel, God’s habitation. Not only at the conclusion of the Bible, but even in the latter part of Genesis, we have the consummate end of God’s economy—Bethel, God’s dwelling place. The word Bethel means the house of God, or the temple of God, the dwelling place of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3Ohl_n2Y8rDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12"> The book of Genesis covers the biographies of eight great persons: Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph. We must include Joseph’s life as part of Jacob’s. In Adam, we have God’s creation, and in Jacob, we have God’s habitation, Bethel. With Jacob we do not merely see God’s selection. Most Christian teachers have spent considerable time on the matter of God’s selection of Jacob. Yes, God’s selection is the beginning, but what is the ending, the consummate goal, of God’s selection? It is Bethel, God’s dwelling place. God created, selected, called, and saved us for the purpose that He might have a dwelling place for eternity. This seed of the building, like all the other seeds in the book of Genesis, is developed throughout the whole Bible. If we would understand the significance of this seed, we must consider the entire Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQJVb6eypG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> Following Jacob, we have the house of Israel. The house of <span class="pg" data-page-id="998" id="998">[998]</span> Israel was actually the house of God. After the exodus from Egypt, there was among the house of Israel the building of the tabernacle, and following the tabernacle, there was the building of the temple. Hence, the Old Testament is a record of eight great men, from Adam through Jacob, plus the tabernacle and the temple. The construction, destruction, and rebuilding of the temple bring us to the end of the Old Testament. What do we have in the New Testament? Again, we have two main things: the tabernacle, which was Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30139" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>), and the temple, which is the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30140" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:16">1 Cor. 3:16</span>). The consummation of the church as the temple is the New Jerusalem. One meaningful and simple way of memorizing the Bible is to remember the eight great men from Adam through Jacob, the tabernacle and the temple as the types in the Old Testament, and the tabernacle and the temple as the reality in the New Testament, the ultimate issue of which is the New Jerusalem. These thirteen items cover the entire Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="uMdoZ7sIrphDxIxrKnqKneutCPpqZxYYQWIgd4x9rSnaU9KtTeicgVo8QagD4QHNt"> What is the subject of the Bible? Some may say that it is man’s fall, God’s redemption, our repentance, God’s forgiveness, our regeneration, and our salvation. Obviously, all these things are found in the Bible. Others may point out that the Bible mentions things such as serpents, scorpions, and frogs. The Bible, containing more than a thousand chapters, is not a simple book. Even one chapter may contain many points. But what is the subject of the Bible? Studying the Bible is similar to studying a human being. Although medical students have studied anatomy and physiology for centuries, they have not exhausted the study of the human body, one-third of a human being. They know something about man’s body, but nothing about the soul and the human spirit. Man is very complicated. Nevertheless, he is still a man, a complete unit. We cannot refer to a man as being a heart, a kidney, or a nose. A man has a nose, but he is not the nose and the nose is not the man. Some say that the subject of the Bible is justification. Justification is included in the Bible, but it is no more the subject of the Bible than a man’s nose is the man himself. If we would know what the subject of the Bible is, we must see that the Bible tells us of eight men, beginning with Adam in God’s creation through Jacob with God’s house, Bethel, and that <span class="pg" data-page-id="999" id="999">[999]</span> following this we have the tabernacle and the temple in the Old Testament and the reality of the tabernacle and the temple in the New Testament, consummating in the New Jerusalem. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30141" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span> says that the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God and that God and the Lamb are the temple in it. Hence, the New Jerusalem is the ultimate issue of Bethel. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnmX9AK4svQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM">e. Being Transformed</h2><p data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3Ohl_n2ZIDDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12"> At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30142" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span>, Jacob must have been approximately a hundred years of age. Although Jacob had passed through many things, prior to this chapter, we are not told that he had ever made a thorough clearance. He suffered many things in relation to his brother, his uncle, and his cousins, suffering twenty years under the hand of his uncle Laban. But Genesis never says that as Jacob was undergoing those sufferings he purified himself or made a clearance of himself. Rather, we are told of Jacob’s skill and supplanting. But, as we shall see, when God told him to arise and go up to Bethel, Jacob made a thorough clearance. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQJVb6fWFG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> The first time God appeared to Jacob was in a dream (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30143" data-verses="Genesis 28:10-22">28:10-22</span>) in which Jacob saw heaven opened and a ladder extending from earth to heaven with angels ascending and descending upon it. When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he was inspired to call the name of that place Bethel, and the stone that he had used as his pillow he set up for a pillar and poured oil upon it. Following this, he vowed that if God would bring him back safely to the land of his fathers, then the stone which he had set up for a pillar would be God’s house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30144" data-verses="Genesis 28:22">28:22</span>). In this dream God paid Jacob a gracious visitation and caused him, undoubtedly in the spirit, to speak concerning God’s eternal economy. If Jacob had not been inspired by the Spirit of God, how could he, a supplanter, have spoken a word revealing God’s eternal purpose? It would have been impossible. God unveiled to Jacob His heart’s desire, which is to have Bethel. </p>
<p data-content-id="uMdoZ7sIrphDxIxrKnqKneutCN9KZxYYQWIgd4x9rSnaU9KtTeicgVo8QagD4QHNt"> However, that dream at Bethel did not change Jacob at all. It seems that after the dream had transpired, the inspiration returned to heaven. Jacob’s manner of life was unaffected. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1000" id="1000">[1000]</span> It is the same with us. At Bethel, Jacob prophesied in a wonderful way, speaking of God’s house, but it seems that the prophecy returned to heaven. Like Jacob, many of us have had a dream, a revelation, or an inspiration in which we uttered a word of prophecy, if not to men, then at least to angels. But the next day we continued to live the same as always. After his dream at Bethel, Jacob continued his supplanting, especially the supplanting of Laban, as if he had never had the dream. In fact, he was even more “Jacobean” after the dream than before. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnmX9AK6oLQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30145" data-verses="Genesis 33:1">chapter thirty-three</span>, Jacob was still Jacob. The heavenly dream and the sufferings had not changed him. But something occurred in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30146" data-verses="Genesis 34:1">chapter thirty-four</span> that touched Jacob’s heart. His only daughter became defiled, and his sons caused him trouble by slaughtering people and plundering their city. These events touched Jacob deeply and caused him to make a radical turn. After this, God came in to speak to him. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-ytt1vGAKBVlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo">1) God’s Reminding—Back to Bethel</h2><p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXQ1T5foce443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> God did not give Jacob a sermon. Rather, because Jacob’s heart had been touched and, as a result, he was ready to hear the word of God, God simply said, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there; and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30147" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">35:1</span>). Here we see that God told Jacob to do four things: to arise, to go up to Bethel, to dwell there, and to make there an altar to God who had appeared to him. The turn, or the change, Jacob made in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30148" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span> was very significant. </p>

<p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qc29Iw7JdzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> Genesis contains the seeds of nearly all the truths in the Bible. If we observe this principle, whenever we come to certain points in this book, we shall recognize that they are developed in the following books of the Bible. In other words, in order to understand any point in Genesis, we need to trace its development elsewhere in the Scriptures. Without the other books, we simply cannot understand Genesis. Genesis is not merely a book of stories. If we would derive the life, the supply, the revelation, and the vision from all the points found in the book of Genesis, then we must follow their development in all the subsequent books of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="aGZQhn44RfDLbiYsGGvVET4MVqaHKCGvuVmdAiPygWOGRgcCG0VL2WETay77K2O7o"> The truth concerning the house of God was sown in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30171" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span>. If you read the Bible carefully, you will see that the house of God was first mentioned in this chapter. The house of God, Bethel, is mentioned in relation to a vision granted to Jacob in a very extraordinary way. Firstly, Jacob had a dream and then his dream was interpreted under divine inspiration. In his dream, Jacob saw the heavens open and a ladder set up on the earth extending from earth to heaven. Upon the ladder the angels of God were ascending and descending. With any dream, we firstly have the facts in the dream and then the proper interpretation. Jacob did not have a Daniel to interpret his dream for him; instead, this supplanter became his own Daniel. He certainly did an excellent job interpreting his dream, saying, “How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30172" data-verses="Genesis 28:17">28:17</span>). Jacob said that this place, Bethel, was dreadful. If you would go to heaven, you must pass through this dreadful place, for the house of God is the gate of heaven. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1012" id="1012">[1012]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="bdPZiOYGTI0GDMWc0r7m5QfANH6ZCY4FzwTm0_1hM378LkILri-YBA6MHtvxUHmDQ"> After his dream, Jacob also made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30173" data-verses="Genesis 28:20-21">28:20-21</span>). Instead of speaking to God in an intimate prayer, he made a vow. As part of his vow, Jacob said that the stone which he had set up for a pillar would be God’s house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30174" data-verses="Genesis 28:22">28:22</span>). In Jacob’s vow we see a further interpretation of his dream. Upon waking, Jacob said that that place was the house of God. Then he promised that the stone he used for a pillow would be built up into God’s house. We see here that the house of God will be built with the stone which was Jacob’s trust. The stone that Jacob used as a pillow is a shadow, a prefigure, a type, of Christ. Only Christ is the real rock that can be the pillow upon which we can lay our weary head. The very Christ on whom we rest will become the house of God. This is the material for building the house of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30175" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">Genesis 28</span> we have the first mention of the stone for God’s building. Of course, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30176" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">chapter two</span> the onyx stone is mentioned, but it is not mentioned in a clear way. The stone which is our trust will become the house of God. This means that the Christ whom we experience as our rest and trust will become the building material for God’s house. </p>
<p data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIITPiGyX3D0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30177" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span> the vision of Bethel came again. This time, however, it did not come just as a dream; it came as a reality. It was not only a vision, but a fact and an experience. The difference between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30178" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">chapters twenty-eight</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30179" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">thirty-five</span> is that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30180" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span> was merely a dream. Bethel, the gate of heaven, the ladder, the angels—everything was seen in a dream. At most, we can only say that this dream was a vision. Up to that point there was no fact, no reality. The fulfillment of the dream comes into being in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30181" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="yObOo7LOjjFarxWXeCIo4NgM-U-nfP03Kiwq9oNdUXzgDgrb2yrYAyxlelIIkT9lp">4) At Bethel</h2><p data-content-id="e4Tu7RSEEn956Bu43KIdFtd1enExLhbqE99G8qhMhliWdoAMPEcx2IgxrawDytCgr"> In this message we need to consider Jacob’s experience at Bethel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30182" data-verses="Genesis 35:6-7">35:6-7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30183" data-verses="Genesis 35:9-15">9-15</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30184" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">Genesis 35</span> Jacob underwent a major change. As we saw in the last message, Jacob reacted to God’s charge to arise and go up to Bethel by having a thorough clearance. This thorough clearance was not only made by him <span class="pg" data-page-id="1013" id="1013">[1013]</span> but by all those who were with him. Jacob was not only concerned with himself but with everyone with him. This is a strong proof that he had had a radical and thorough change. Undoubtedly, Jacob had been transformed. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_LU_uUOBYw3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj">a) Jacob Having Built an Altar to God</h2><p data-content-id="NgrUOPst9ndCGqPDKS1sPHcW5DPRKLEkyN_8bfWBSPyO-5g1-dnym0-8I86wUsKBc"> Jacob came to Bethel, “he and all the people that were with him. And he built there an altar, and called the place El-Beth-el” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30185" data-verses="Genesis 35:6-7">vv. 6-7</span>). The first thing Jacob did at Bethel was to build an altar. Although Jacob had built an altar in Shechem, he did not call that altar “El-Shechem.” He could not use the title of God for the altar he built in Shechem. This means that the altar in Shechem did not touch God’s heart; it was not the altar He desired. Likewise, we may build altars everywhere without building the altar God desires. You may build an altar in Las Vegas, but you cannot call it the altar of God in Las Vegas. But when Jacob acted on the word of God, arising, going up to Bethel, dwelling there, and building an altar to God, he built an altar according to God’s desires, not according to his own intention. God did not ask him to build an altar in Shechem, for that was not His choice. God’s desire was to bring him back to Bethel. Thus, the altar built by Jacob in Shechem was neither according to God’s desire nor according to His word. But because the altar Jacob built in Bethel was built at the word of God, he had the boldness to call it “El-Beth-el.” </p>
<p data-content-id="topU0NZPOs7b25ters3Gd425K2iJhSqSpV5hz_XoXr_MU93J_kJdBBom0evJv9lGi"> You may do many things for God, such as preaching the gospel and rendering other service to Him. You may even establish a meeting and designate it as the church. However, you do not have the confidence or the boldness to say that that is something of God. This is even true in small things. For example, you may love a brother, but not have the boldness to call that love the love of God. Although you do love that brother, you do not love him at God’s word. Rather, you love him by your own choice and according to your personal taste. Because it is your love, you cannot say that it is “El-love,” the love of God. You cannot call it the love of God until you love people at God’s word and not according to your <span class="pg" data-page-id="1014" id="1014">[1014]</span> taste. When God tells you to love a certain brother, you must love him at His word. If you love the brother in this way, then your love will be the love of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="h08U91ltZnqTUI0aV0g56mCGiI86Cw-cZTKHrVo12qTwS3OgmpjHqkUk9BKO83GId"> Many missionaries have gone to the mission field without having the assurance that their mission was “El-mission.” Many have told me that while they were working they had no peace. They did not have the confidence, assurance, or boldness to say that their mission work was the work of God. They were doubtful about it and could not attach God’s name to it. </p>
<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWJBbBEoKtXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> Many Christians today are forming groups. The larger groups become denominations and the smaller groups remain free groups. However, the founders of those groups do not have the confidence to call them the church. But when we in the Lord’s recovery say that we are the church, they are offended. Deep within them, they lack the assurance to say that they are the church. A man is a man, and a woman is a woman. You cannot call a man a woman. Fifty years ago I began to say, “This is the church.” The more I said this, the more confident I became because this really is the church. If it is not the church, then what is it? I am a man. The more I say that I am a man, the more assured I am of being a man. If you do not call me a man, then what would you call me? You may do many different things—start a mission work, establish a meeting, form a Bible study—but it all may simply be a good work done in Shechem, not in Bethel. Hence, you cannot call that work “El-Beth-el.” However, when Jacob built the altar in Bethel, he had the boldness to call it “El-Beth-el.” </p>

The house of God, Bethel, is one of these seeds. However, not many Christians know what the experience of the house of God is. Undoubtedly, many know that, according to the New Testament, the house of God denotes the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30225" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">1 Tim. 3:15</span>). But where is the practical and proper church life? Although there are millions of Christians on earth, very few of them have the genuine church life. Many merely sit in the congregation for the Sunday morning service and listen to a minister or pastor. But this is not the practical and proper church life revealed in the Bible. According to the Bible, in the genuine church life every saved one must be a living, functioning member. Every member of the Body of Christ must function. Not only do the members function, but they also live together to express God in Christ in a living, daily way. This is the practical church life revealed in the Bible. The truths regarding this practical church life are sown as seeds in Genesis. </p>
<p data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQeidHqMfFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B"> Prior to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30226" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span>, God was called the God of a certain person, for example, the God of Abraham or the God of Isaac. He was the God of individual persons. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30227" data-verses="Genesis 35:7">35:7</span> we have “El-Beth-el,” the God of the house of God. He is no longer simply the God of individuals; He is now the God of a corporate body, the house of God. Many Christians only experience God as their individual God. Not many have the experience of God as the God of the house of God. How much experience do you have of God as the God of a corporate body? <span class="pg" data-page-id="1026" id="1026">[1026]</span> We all must experience God in such a way that He is not only God to us individually, but also the God of the house of God. There is a great difference between the two. </p>
<p data-content-id="QMSNPOcCBLw6v-EOydvwYHV1It8TduX4YH5_O01lRUzkJdbjHu_x8PZ2HwO74uIjb"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30228" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">Genesis 35</span> we see a crucial and radical turn. However, not many children of God appreciate this. They read this chapter again and again without recognizing the radical turn contained in it. Before this chapter, God was the God of individuals. He was the God of Abel, the God of Enosh, the God of Enoch, the God of Noah, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac. But here He is no longer just the God of individuals, but El-Bethel, the God of the house of God. In Hebrew, “El” means God. In the title El-Bethel this Hebrew word for God is used twice, at both the beginning and the ending of this title. In a sense, the God of the house of God is double. We must admit that we do not yet have much experience of this. But we thank the Lord that after coming into the church life, we have had some experience of God’s being God to us as a corporate body. In the church life, we do experience God corporately and not only individually. We all can testify that the God we experience in the church life is much richer and sweeter than the God we experience in our individual life. This is why we like to spend more time in the church life. Individually, we can experience the God of Abraham or the God of Isaac, but we cannot experience God as the God of Bethel. We can only experience the God of the house of God in the church life. If many years ago you had been told about the God of the corporate body, it would have sounded like a foreign language to you. But today this is not foreign to us. We are familiar with this experience and we appreciate it much more than our individual experience of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7WkrWenz93ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo"> This does not mean, however, that there is not the aspect of experiencing God in an individual way. Even today, there is still this aspect. Never forget that the truths in the Bible have two aspects. This is also true of the experience of God, for the experience of God has a corporate aspect as well as an individual aspect. Many Christians today either have no experience of God or have just the individual experience of God. They lack the experience of God in a corporate way. But <span class="pg" data-page-id="1027" id="1027">[1027]</span> in meeting after meeting of the church life, we experience God in a corporate way. </p>
<p data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjK9MH8TpcGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD"> At this point, I need to speak an honest word to some of you. Although you meet with us week after week, you do not have the corporate experience of God. For instance, you pray daily in your private life, but you never pray in the church meetings. In the meetings, you are observers, like a spectator at a ball game. You watch others play, but you yourselves do not play. You never participate in the meetings. Furthermore, some of you criticize those who do participate, saying that they are too bold or too quick. But what about you? Are you here to be critics, spectators, or to participate in the church life? This indicates that some among us do not appreciate the experience of God in a corporate way. Some of us still do not pray in the meetings. If you were asked to pray, you would always excuse yourselves. This reveals that you consider others as the priests and yourselves as the common people. By doing this you establish a clergy-laity hierarchy. In the eyes of God, this is heretical. We all must pray to overthrow this clergy-laity system. </p>
<p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qfGZIx_ldzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> According to my registration, the prayer meeting in Anaheim is better than that in any other church. I have visited nearly all the churches and I can testify that the prayer meeting in Anaheim is the best. The reason is that there is no clergy or laity in our prayer meeting. Although many pray, no one completes a prayer by himself. Rather, it may take many of us to finish one prayer. In the old, traditional way, when someone prayed, he not only finished one prayer but perhaps two or three other prayers at the same time. Either people did not pray at all, or they would pray several prayers in succession. But in Anaheim after someone prays a short sentence, someone else will follow him. In this way, many function together to offer one prayer. This is the experience of El-Bethel, the corporate experience of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="aGZQhn44RfDLbiYsGGvVEQIoVrunKCGvuVmdAiPygWOGRgcCG0VL2WETay77K2O7o"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30229" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">Genesis 35</span> is a radical turn from the individual experience of God to the corporate experience of God. Before this chapter, El-Bethel is not mentioned. Elohim was revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30230" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapter one</span>, and Jehovah was revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30231" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">chapter two</span>. Later, God told Jacob that He was the God of Abraham and the God <span class="pg" data-page-id="1028" id="1028">[1028]</span> of Isaac. But, as we have pointed out, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30232" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span> we see a new divine title—El-Bethel, God of the house of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="bdPZiOYGTI0GDMWc0r7m5TvkNGe9CY4FzwTm0_1hM378LkILri-YBA6MHtvxUHmDQ"> Elsewhere in this message we shall see the significance of God’s telling Jacob that his name was no longer Jacob but Israel. God said to Jacob, “Israel shall be thy name” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30233" data-verses="Genesis 35:10">v. 10</span>), and Jacob seemed to say to God, “Your name is El-Bethel.” Who are you today—Jacob or Israel? What does Israel mean? To answer that it means a wrestler of God is too doctrinal. Israel is the church people, and El-Bethel is the church life. We are the church people in the church life. This is not doctrine; it is experience. The church people are a people filled with God, and the church life is a corporate life of God. The church people are a people filled with God, living together to enjoy God and to express Him. This is Israel in El-Bethel. </p>

<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0ZJTRYpm8onn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF">e) God’s Promise</h2><p data-content-id="YWQf39oOaKT-w18LKhlsjrtEn9AsDjHh52RJBmzJk0PH2LSkAzFUEZelzC01-ioTH"> We may be quite familiar with the term promise. In this portion of the Word, however, God’s promise is not common. The God who gives the promise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30262" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span> is God all-sufficient (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30263" data-verses="Genesis 35:11">v. 11</span>, Heb.). We need to give attention to the revelation of God’s titles in the book of Genesis. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30264" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapter one</span>, God is only revealed as Elohim, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30265" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">chapter two</span> we see the title Jehovah (rendered Lord in the King James Version). Elohim is God’s title as Creator in relation to His creation, and Jehovah is His title in His relationship with man, revealing how God is related to man. The title the all-sufficient God, or God all-sufficient, is not revealed until <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30266" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">17:1</span>, where God said to Abraham, “I am the all-sufficient God; walk before me and be thou perfect” (Heb.). In the past, we did not adequately realize the significance of this title. We thought that it simply meant that God was everything to us. Undoubtedly, it is correct to say that God’s all-sufficiency means that He is everything to us. But for what purpose is this title of God revealed? I have given a number of messages in the past on this title of God, telling people that it denotes that God is rich and that He is our all-sufficient supply. He is everything to supply all our need. In a sense, this was right. God is all-sufficient in order to supply us. But for what does He supply us? Does He supply us merely in order that we might be saved or be spiritual? No. If we would see the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1038" id="1038">[1038]</span> purpose for God’s being the all-sufficient One, we need to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30267" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">Genesis 35</span> and compare it with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30268" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Genesis 17</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="E-xv1nlZl2LrnNkDtbmzOdo2dsG6tUIFb3C0mvDz1LtjokSWkphwKc-Ng-yoBiibt"> The purpose of God’s revealing Himself as the all-sufficient God is for His building. Just as Elohim is for God’s creation, so the all-sufficient God is for God’s building. Do not understand the Holy Word by your imagination. Understand the Bible by the Bible itself, by comparing one portion of the Word with another. How do we know that Elohim is for God’s creation? All Bible students agree that the first mention of an item in the Bible establishes a principle for that particular thing. The first mention of Elohim is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30269" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>. In this chapter, God is revealed for His creation. Therefore, this establishes the principle that Elohim basically denotes the creating God, God the Creator. </p>
<p data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2wiKOa0hY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30270" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Genesis 17:1</span>, the first mention of the title the all-sufficient God, El-Shaddai, clearly reveals the significance of this title. Prior to that time, Abraham had been called by God for the purpose of becoming the father of so many of God’s called ones. God did not intend that Abraham fulfill this by the exercise of his natural strength, and God did not give Abraham a child until his natural strength had been exhausted. Abraham, however, neither understood God adequately, nor had faith in Him for this. Instead, he followed his wife’s proposal that he bring forth a child by using his natural strength with a concubine. God was offended by this and did not speak to Abraham for thirteen years. Do not think that God cannot be offended, or that He will always be patient with you. We are nowhere told in the Bible that God is all-patient. In Abraham’s case, God was offended, not by sin, but by the exercise of Abraham’s natural strength. In God’s economy, nothing offends Him more than your exercise of your natural strength. Whenever a called one of God uses his natural strength to do something for the accomplishment of God’s purpose, God will be offended. In a sense, using your natural strength is an insult to God. God does not need your help. To exercise your natural strength means that you are capable of helping God. This indicates that God is not sufficient and that He needs you to assist Him. When God spoke to Abraham again after an interval of thirteen years, He said, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1039" id="1039">[1039]</span> “I am the all-sufficient God.” If you read this chapter carefully, you will see that God’s being all-sufficient is for us to produce the materials for His house. </p>
<p data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8AfonztgenOuNK4c1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30271" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Genesis 17</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30272" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">35</span> correspond to each other in at least three ways. Firstly, both chapters reveal that God is all-sufficient. God revealed this divine title to both Abraham and Jacob. Secondly, in both chapters a change of name occurs. Abraham’s name was changed from Abram to Abraham, and Jacob’s name was changed from Jacob to Israel. In spiritual life, the change of name signifies transformation, not merely the change of label. You may say, “Witness Lee, you have done something wrong. From now on, you are not Witness Lee but Charles Ford.” This change of label means nothing. According to the Bible, to change your name is to change your being. Formerly, you were Abram; now you are Abraham. Previously, you were a supplanting Jacob; now you are Israel, the wrestler of God. This is the change, not of a label, but of your being, of your constitution. Hence, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30273" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> speaks of the transformation of Abraham and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30274" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span> speaks of the transformation of Jacob. </p>
<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6tWL5kNlWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> Thirdly, in both chapters we have God’s promise. God’s promise to Abraham is repeated in His promise to Jacob. God’s promise to Jacob in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30275" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span> was indefinite. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30276" data-verses="Genesis 28:14">28:14</span> God said, “Thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth.” If I had been Jacob, I would have said, “Lord, I don’t want my descendants to be dust. Instead of millions of particles of dust, I would rather have a few kings.” Although God’s promise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30277" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span> speaks of dust, His promise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30278" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span> speaks of kings and nations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30279" data-verses="Genesis 35:11">v. 11</span>). A nation denotes a kingdom. God’s promise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30280" data-verses="Genesis 35:11">35:11</span> is a repetition of His promise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30281" data-verses="Genesis 17:6">17:6</span>. In both instances, He promised that nations and kings would come forth. In Jacob’s dream at Bethel, God told him that his seed would be as dust. But now, in the actual experience at Bethel in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30282" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span>, God’s promise has advanced. Here, there is no mention of dust. Instead of dust there are nations with kings. The focus of the promise in this chapter is to be fruitful and multiply to bring forth nations with kings. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30283" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Genesis 17</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30284" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">35</span> correspond to each other in three respects: in the revelation of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1040" id="1040">[1040]</span> divine title, the all-sufficient God; in the changing of human names; and in the promise of multiplication for bringing forth nations with kings. </p>
<p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWjw9m4trAfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> Now we can see the purpose of the title the all-sufficient God. The all-sufficient God is for the building of God’s house. We all need to take in this word. The all-sufficient God is for the building of Bethel. God is all-sufficient for the church life, for the building of His house on earth. You cannot experience the all-sufficient God in an individualistic way. In order to experience the all-sufficient God, you must be in Bethel, in the house of God, in the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXkWv9gNWQwrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip"> This truth is proved by our experience. Before we came to the church life, many of us had some experience of God. But as we all can testify, we did not experience God as the all-sufficient One. Although I experienced God in various aspects, I did not experience Him as the all-sufficient One until I came into the church life. But after being in the church life for many years, I can say, “Hallelujah, what an experience of the all-sufficient God I have in the church life!” God is too all-sufficient to be experienced by just a few individual believers. As individuals, we are too limited. God’s all-sufficiency requires a corporate body. We need the house in order to experience this aspect of Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LmaUqaAXyrZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> Recently, we had a marvelous prayer meeting here in Anaheim. I believe that that meeting will stand as a memorial for eternity. All the utterances in the prayers were unique. In our prayers we prayed about the travailing woman and about the prevailing, victorious man-child. It was wonderful! We could never have prayer like this alone in our rooms; we must be in the church. Any local saints who missed that prayer meeting certainly missed a great deal. This is an experience, not of Elohim or of Jehovah, but of the all-sufficient God. In that prayer meeting I was above the third heaven enjoying the all-sufficient God. Only in the church life is it possible to realize the all-sufficiency of our God. </p>

<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWKx3BFM2tXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> In this message we shall still dwell on the experience at Bethel. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30302" data-verses="Genesis 35:14">35:14</span>, at Bethel Jacob eventually set up a pillar of stone as he did after having the dream when he was at Bethel the first time (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30303" data-verses="Genesis 28:18">28:18</span>). There, this pillar of stone was called the house of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30304" data-verses="Genesis 28:22">28:22</span>). If Jacob had not called this pillar the house of God, we would never realize that the pillar of stone was for the building of God’s house. We would think that it was simply a mass of rock. But now we know that this stone can become a house. This indicates that the pillar will become a building, the house of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="MtCll2XOY8R8dFgTUXdR4YdE7V878JwNRjNJM9TIVoQfsRCA1WYTsZI35lh9oQ1PX"> In the book of Genesis, there are two kinds of pillars—the pillar of stone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30305" data-verses="Genesis 28:18">28:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30306" data-verses="Genesis 35:14">35:14</span>) and the pillar of salt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30307" data-verses="Genesis 19:26">19:26</span>). Which kind of pillar do you want to be? Certainly, we all want to be pillars of stone. The pillar of stone indicates building in strength. Solomon set up two pillars in the porch of the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30308" data-verses="1Kings 7:21">1 Kings 7:21</span>). The first pillar was named Jachin, which means, “He shall establish,” and the second was named Boaz, which means, “In it is strength.” The pillar of stone not only indicates building, but building in strength. The pillar of salt indicates shame, for a pillar of salt is useless for God’s purpose. Lot’s wife, who was one of God’s called people, became a pillar of shame. She should have been building material, but due to her degradation she became shameful material. </p>
<p data-content-id="Vyv6cezndY8yrw_ApV0zPcEi7H_2JbjcYWxSSt0SaXZR8SPfWLyu4As---ucS3eoN"> During the course of this life-study, we have seen again and again that nearly everything in this book is a seed of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1050" id="1050">[1050]</span> truth that is developed in the following books of the Bible. The way to study Genesis is to trace all its points in the subsequent books of the Bible. The way to study the book of Revelation is just the opposite. If you would understand Revelation, you must trace its points backward in the foregoing books. In this message we need to follow the development of the seed of the pillar. </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYQoskVksNMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx">(a) A General Sketch</h2><h2 class="head7" data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZiwvrVFAp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6">aa. For the Temple</h2>
<p data-content-id="BLE5KA_UJUWmNHemF8RznOimercB0O1klPDPPz_cM4ETPjCdTs_KDy-6YMjsxBV2U"> After Solomon built the temple, he purposely added the two pillars. According to our natural concept, we would think that Solomon should firstly have built the pillars and then the temple. But it was after he had built the temple that he proceeded to build two pillars and to place them in front of the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30309" data-verses="1Kings 7:15-22">1 Kings 7:15-22</span>). If we could have seen that temple, our eyes would have firstly attended, not to the temple itself, but to these two pillars. The size of these pillars is seemingly out of proportion to the size of the temple. The disproportionate size of the pillars is significant. It indicates that the two pillars in the temple are like a huge signboard. Today, when we approach a certain building, there is a sign designating what that building is. Likewise, in front of the temple were two pillars which said, “God shall establish,” and, “In it is strength.” These two pillars declare to the whole universe, including mankind, Satan, and all the fallen angels, that the Lord establishes and that strength is in the building. The Bible emphatically says that the first pillar is called Jachin and the second Boaz. We have pointed out that the name Jachin means, “He shall establish” and that the name Boaz means, “In it is strength.” This reveals clearly that the building of God’s house is altogether dependent on the pillar. This is the reason that Jacob did not build the house of God, but only set up a pillar. </p>
<p data-content-id="x52sBK0RPP8CO8qDhR2srpPetnwO0DNKTmsXdJCAVgGjfw6s5s9H5KtPnduIvZkRU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30310" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span>, Jacob was still a supplanter. Nevertheless, this supplanter received both the vision and the interpretation of the vision. He interpreted his vision, his dream, by setting up a pillar and calling it God’s house. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="1051" id="1051">[1051]</span> interpretation was much better than Daniel’s interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dreams. Daniel merely interpreted; he did not set up anything or take any action. Jacob, however, not only interpreted his dream verbally, saying, “This is the house of God”; he also set up a pillar and called it the house of God. How could Jacob, an unrepentant, unregenerated, and untransformed supplanter, have done such a wonderful thing? Nevertheless, he did it, and we all must say, “Thank you, Jacob, for opening the heavens that we might see the house of God.” </p>
<p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2OhWInStiDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> For the building of God’s house, the heavens were opened by a supplanter. I believe this because the Bible tells us so. I do not trust in my concept, for according to my concept, it would be impossible for a supplanter to do this. I could easily believe that a godly and pious person like Daniel, a man who prayed daily, could have interpreted a spiritual dream. But it seems neither fair nor logical for a supplanter to do this. But he did it spontaneously. This is absolutely a matter of grace. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30311" data-verses="Romans 9:11">Romans 9:11</span> indicates, it is “not of works, but of Him who calls.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30312" data-verses="Romans 9:13">Romans 9:13</span> says, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” Grace is not a matter of fairness. Do not question God, saying, “God, why do You hate Esau? To me Esau is better than Jacob. It is unfair for You to love Jacob and hate Esau.” To this, God would reply, “I simply love Jacob and hate Esau. What do you have to say about this? When I hate, I have the position to hate, and when I love, I have the grace to love.” Who are you—Esau or Jacob, a good man or a supplanter? We all must confess that we are Jacobs, heel-holders, supplanters. The church is filled with heel-holders. If you are not a heel-holder, you will miss God’s grace. We are true heel-holders, but we are heel-holders in grace. No one can deny this. I can shout and declare, “Praise the Lord that I am a heel-holder in grace. Grace makes me different.” </p>
<p data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQeiVHrojFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B"> Although in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30313" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span> Jacob was a supplanter, by the time we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30314" data-verses="Genesis 48:1">chapter forty-eight</span> we see that this supplanter has been thoroughly transformed into a man of God. This man of God is the pillar. In a sense, the house of God was built with this pillar. When you enter into the temple of God in the universe, the first thing you see is this <span class="pg" data-page-id="1052" id="1052">[1052]</span> God-man, this Israel standing before God’s building. After Jacob was transformed into Israel, he stood in front of God’s building as a signboard of God’s house. </p>

For the Building of the Church</h2><p data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7Wkreel3J3ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo"> As we proceed to the New Testament, we see that the Lord Jesus came through incarnation. His incarnation was the erecting of a tabernacle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30315" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>). This tabernacle, which was erected that God might dwell among men, was a precursor of the temple. When you see a little boy, you know that a full-grown man is coming. Likewise, when you see the tabernacle, you realize that the temple is coming. As the tabernacle, Jesus was the indicator that God’s temple was soon to appear. This is why the Lord changed the name of Simon, the representative of the first group of disciples, to Cephas, which means a stone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30316" data-verses="John 1:42">John 1:42</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30317" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>, after Peter had answered the Lord’s question, “Who do you say that I am?” by saying, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,” the Lord Jesus responded, “You are a stone” (Gk.). The Lord seemed to be saying, “I am Christ, the rock, and you are a stone to be built upon Me for the building up of My church.” In his first Epistle, Peter later said, “You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30318" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">1 Pet. 2:5</span>). Consider also the case of the Apostle Paul. Formerly, he was an opposer of God’s building, doing everything possible to persecute, damage, and lay it waste. But as he was on his way to Damascus to persecute the church, he was caught by the Lord and became not only the material for the building, but also a wise masterbuilder (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30319" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:10">1 Cor. 3:10</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtqKGoiKvD_u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m"> I am still burdened about the pillar. Based upon the principle that nearly everything in the book of Genesis is a seed that is developed in the following books of the Bible, we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30359" data-verses="1Kings 7:13-22">1 Kings 7:13-22</span>, a strong portion in the Word regarding the pillars. In Jacob’s calling, Jacob’s being transformed was mainly related to this matter of the pillar. After his dream at Bethel, Jacob set up a pillar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30360" data-verses="Genesis 28:18">28:18</span>). When he returned to Bethel, he also set up a pillar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30361" data-verses="Genesis 35:14">35:14</span>). When Jacob set up the pillar the first time, he said, “This stone which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30362" data-verses="Genesis 28:22">28:22</span>). This indicates that the pillar was not only the pillar, but also that it would become Bethel, the house of God. In 1 Kings we have the first mention of the temple. Prior to that, there was the tabernacle, but no temple. The most striking feature of the exterior of the temple was the two pillars. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30363" data-verses="1Kings 7:1">1 Kings chapter seven</span> we have a detailed picture of these pillars. I am burdened that, having considered the seed of the pillar in Genesis, we now look into the development of this seed in the following books of the Old Testament. Later, we shall consider the consummation of this seed in the New Testament. </p>

<p data-content-id="sHB9QAVlSM3v0XjManno-kAwrkT_fHA5fTkqfQSTHo75EQs1z1Iu7LXCJgPqSPnNs"> The pillars of the temple were built by Solomon through Hiram, “a worker in brass” who was “filled with wisdom, and understanding, and skill to work all works in brass” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30364" data-verses="1Kings 7:14">1 Kings 7:14</span>). Much of what is found in the Old Testament, such as the tabernacle and the temple, is a shadow, a type. We need to <span class="pg" data-page-id="1064" id="1064">[1064]</span> know the fulfillment of all these types. Solomon was a type of Christ, and Hiram was a type of the gifted person in the New Testament. Undoubtedly, the Apostle Paul was a gifted person; he was the New Testament Hiram. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30365" data-verses="Ephesians 4:11-12">Ephesians 4:11 and 12</span> say, “And He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints.” The gifted persons are given by the Head to the Body to perfect the saints. That the pillars were not built by Solomon directly but by Solomon through Hiram indicates that today Christ does not build up the pillars directly but through the gifted persons. Thus, we must submit to the hands of the gifted persons, just as the brass was subject to the skilled and gifted hands of Hiram. </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XQ5pDdrvkw1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW">bb. Two Pillars</h2><p data-content-id="sHB9QAVlSM3v0XjManno-kAwrmHXfHA5fTkqfQSTHo75EQs1z1Iu7LXCJgPqSPnNs"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30366" data-verses="1Kings 7:15">1 Kings 7:15</span>, Hiram “fashioned two pillars” (Heb.). In the Bible, the number two is the number of testimony. These two pillars stood in front of the temple as a testimony. The thought concerning the pillar in the book of Genesis is that of testimony. After Jacob had arranged a settlement with Laban, he “took a stone, and set it up for a pillar” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30367" data-verses="Genesis 31:45">31:45</span>), and this pillar was a testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30368" data-verses="Genesis 31:51-52">31:51-52</span>). Undoubtedly, when Jacob set up the pillar in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30369" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span>, his concept was also that of a testimony. Under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, he said that this testimony would be the house of God. The temple in the Old Testament certainly was a testimony to God. The principle is the same with respect to the church today. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30370" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">1 Timothy 3:15</span>, the house of God, which is the church, is the pillar. This means that the church as a whole stands on earth to testify God to the universe. Therefore, the two pillars in front of the temple in the Old Testament were a strong testimony of God’s building. </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XQ5pDdprIw1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW">cc. Of Brass</h2><p data-content-id="LD01-v3um3NuLShGttlVio2enW7MRg9jsTHcyuTXlEDKbBHncuqREEkOSwGaFv9xn"> Now we come to a crucial point—the two pillars were made of brass (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30371" data-verses="1Kings 7:15">1 Kings 7:15</span>). In Genesis the pillar is a pillar of stone, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30372" data-verses="1Kings 7:1">1 Kings 7</span> the pillars are pillars of brass. A stone indicates transformation. Although we are clay, we can <span class="pg" data-page-id="1065" id="1065">[1065]</span> be transformed into stone. But what does brass signify? It signifies God’s judgment. For example, the altar at the entrance of the tabernacle was covered with brass indicating God’s judgment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30373" data-verses="Exodus 27:1-2">Exo. 27:1-2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30374" data-verses="Numbers 16:38-40">Num. 16:38-40</span>). The laver was also made of brass (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30375" data-verses="Exodus 30:18">Exo. 30:18</span>). Furthermore, the serpent of brass put on a pole (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30376" data-verses="Numbers 21:8-9">Num. 21:8-9</span>) also testified of Christ’s being judged by God on our behalf (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30377" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span>). Therefore, in typology, brass always signifies God’s judgment. That the two pillars were made of brass clearly indicates that if we would be a pillar, we must realize that we are those under God’s judgment. We should not only be under God’s judgment, but also under our own judgment. Like Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30378" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>, we must say, “I have been crucified. I have been crucified because I am not good for anything in God’s economy. I am only qualified for death.” Many brothers are intelligent and capable and many sisters are quite nice. Nevertheless, we must recognize that actually we are not good at all. We are not even worth a penny. We are only good for death. To say, “I have been put aside, condemned, and put to death,” is a type of self-judgment. What is your judgment regarding yourself? You must answer, “My judgment of myself is that I am good for nothing and that I have been crucified.” </p>
<p data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD0V-V0CL7iWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP"> If you think that you are qualified to be a pillar, then you are already disqualified. Let me relate something concerning Brother Nee’s practice relating to the appointment of elders. Brother Nee said that no one who was ambitious to be an elder should ever be an elder. Therefore, many of us in mainland China said, “Don’t think that you can be an elder and do not be ambitious to be an elder. If you are ambitious to be an elder, you can never be one.” When I first came to Shanghai in 1933, I met a certain brother. I later discovered that he was very ambitious to be an elder. Brother Nee told me that just because this brother was so ambitious to be an elder he was not qualified to be an elder. Whoever is ambitious to be an elder is disqualified from being one. More or less, as some brothers can testify, we have practiced this during these years in the United States. A few among us have hunted for eldership. They have even moved from place to place seeking an opportunity to be an elder. After realizing <span class="pg" data-page-id="1066" id="1066">[1066]</span> that the eldership in a particular locality had been filled up, they moved to another locality where there were many openings. However, those openings could only be filled by those who had no ambition to be elders. Once we discover that a brother is ambitious to be an elder, he will be fully disqualified for eternity. The reason for this is that such a brother is not a person under God’s judgment. We all must say, “I am not qualified. I am poor, sinful, fallen, and corrupt.” Moreover, we must say, “Lord, I am so fallen, sinful, and corrupt. How could I bear the responsibility of the eldership? I am not qualified for this.” This is the experience of brass. To justify ourselves and to qualify ourselves is to be through with the brass. Those who experience brass are those who are constantly under judgment. </p>

<p data-content-id="CAIiqFyjjgw0LbNxWLi5D_4P-xyGcXq_WajUO0fMiI1qsIetqtq6bkTvknnO7bFYb"> In this message we shall again devote our attention to the two pillars at the temple. We have seen that when Jacob was first at Bethel, he set up as a pillar the stone he had used for a pillow and called it the house of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30401" data-verses="Genesis 28:18">28:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30402" data-verses="Genesis 28:22">22</span>). We have pointed out again and again that nearly everything in the book of Genesis is a seed that is developed in the following books of the Bible. The full development of the seed of the pillar is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30403" data-verses="Revelation 3:12">Revelation 3:12</span>, where the Lord Jesus says, “He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God.” Between Genesis and Revelation, there are many portions of the Word concerning the pillars. Each time the two pillars at the temple are mentioned we see more of the details regarding them. Not every aspect of the pillars is found in any single portion. </p>
<p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KabzxnQr7e1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> Today’s Christians have very little concern for God’s building, which is for the accomplishment of God’s economy. Although most Christians neglect this, the Bible strongly emphasizes it. If we would know the building, according to the biblical way, we must firstly see the pillar, for the pillar is a signboard of God’s building. If we see what the pillar is and decide to become a pillar, then we are on the way of God’s building. The pillar is so crucial that the Bible mentions it over and over again. Because most Christians have no understanding of God’s building, they do not pay attention to those portions of Scripture which mention the pillar. But by the Lord’s mercy we have been so deeply impressed with the pillar that we simply cannot get away from it. The Bible has no wasted words. Hence, whatever it reveals is meaningful and crucial for us. Because, at this end time, God is completing <span class="pg" data-page-id="1080" id="1080">[1080]</span> His building, we must carefully consider what the pillar is and how we can become a pillar. </p>
<p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_QQE1C-JgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> I would like now to stress three positive aspects and two negative aspects of the pillars covered in the last message. The three positive aspects are the brass, the lily, and the pomegranates. The pillars themselves were made of brass. On the top of the capital were the lilies and around the capital were the pomegranates. I doubt that any human designer would ever have put these three things together. But how crucial and meaningful it all is to us! Brass signifies death under judgment. We must be under judgment, realizing that we are good for nothing but death and that we have been crucified (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30404" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>). Furthermore, we all have been buried in baptism (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30405" data-verses="Romans 6:4">Rom. 6:4</span>). Thus, we are a people under the judgment of death. But after death comes resurrection, and the lily grows upon us in resurrection. The pomegranates surrounding the capital signify the expression of the riches of life. Therefore, in the pillars we see death, resurrection, and the expression of life. Praise the Lord that many of us can testify that day by day we are the brass growing lilies and expressing pomegranates. Are you not such a person? If you are not, then you are not qualified to be a pillar and you have nothing to do with God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="prNfLWZ9JdrW7yTc3YS3U9PP_o1moK-lAf5XbjI5e4-Pr6RDr_aquY_gO4K9YJN2U"> The two negative aspects of the pillars are the checkerwork (the network) and the chainwork. The checkerwork and chainwork signify the intermixed and complicated situation. The checkerwork is a lattice composed of intersecting bars. This indicates that, in our experience, we are daily being crossed out. As we undergo this, we are held by the chainwork. Many times we brothers are under the crossing out of our dear wives. Although we may desire to escape this, we are held by the chains and cannot slip away. We may be cut into pieces, but not one piece can escape. The sisters can all testify of the same thing in relation to their husbands. Some in the church life say that they cannot bear the crossing out of the elders. However, the chainwork is also there. In the church life we have both the checkerwork and the chainwork. Praise the Lord for these two negative things, because the brass, the lily, and the pomegranates can only be connected by them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1081" id="1081">[1081]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="vGPkFtfe7Aen3iGIVhF4De23r6BhJoSKHjShQRi-Q6TFheMiOa11sXw6WrcmFYS61"> Not long after I was saved, I learned that I had been crucified with Christ. But I did not know how this crucifixion could practically be applied to me. It is applied by the checkerwork, the network. Without the network and the chainwork, our co-crucifixion with Christ and His living instead of us would be mere doctrine. We may know the doctrine of being crucified with Christ and recite <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30406" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> over and over only to discover that this does not avail. I did this again and again without success. I repeated the words, “I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” Later, I experienced the network and the chainwork in the church life. It has been through these two negative things that the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ have been practically applied to my life. Eventually, therefore, the three positive things and the two negative things become one unit. We have the brass, the lily, and the pomegranates joined by the checkerwork and the chainwork. All five are joined in the pillar. </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKQjiEn3g_CaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI">ll. Two Bowls of the Two Capitals<br/>on the Top of the Two Pillars, Two Cubits High</h2><p data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnAnk81SPEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB"> In addition to all the points covered in the previous message, we must cover nine further points in this message. God, His Word, and His dealing with us are not simple. </p>
<p data-content-id="4ih-7ivO1f_Uex_xN1d2zKd9dJq1CD7MrPWGnia394uU8LdMUmJUsII4OLzctGMcQ"> On the top of the capitals which were on the pillars were two bowls (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30407" data-verses="2Chronicles 4:12">2 Chron. 4:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30408" data-verses="2Kings 25:17">2 Kings 25:17</span>). Each bowl, including the network, was two cubits high (see definition below). What does this signify? The bowls are round. (Darby translates the Hebrew word for bowls as “globes.”) On the top of each capital there were two bowls, one above the other. Around the capitals were “chains like a necklace,” or “chains at the collar,” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30409" data-verses="2Chronicles 3:16">2 Chron. 3:16</span>, Amplified Bible; Darby’s New Translation) that divided the capital into two sections. The first section was the base. Although <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30410" data-verses="1Kings 7:16">1 Kings 7:16</span> says that the capitals were five cubits high, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30411" data-verses="2Kings 25:17">2 Kings 25:17</span> says that the capitals were three cubits high. The reason for this is that three cubits is the height of the base of the capital and five cubits is the height of the whole capital. In other words, there were three cubits for the base and two for the bowls. Here, the number <span class="pg" data-page-id="1082" id="1082">[1082]</span> three does not signify the Triune God. Rather, it signifies the process of resurrection. In the Bible, two numbers, three and eight, signify resurrection. Three signifies the process of resurrection, and eight, the first day of a new week, denotes the freshness of resurrection, the new beginning in resurrection. The three cubits of the base of the capital are closely related to the network and the chainwork. This reveals that the network and the chainwork are for the process of resurrection. Moreover, the number two, the height of the two bowls, signifies testimony. The two cubits of the two bowls on the two capitals of the two pillars signify testimony by living as a lily and by expressing the riches of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="oojwSJGvLbmiYj5tIQGoqbwEH5Pc4PdhX0jmIOM9tm0WtyG5HMI5sjMdIyAZ1hq_3"> If you read all the portions concerning the two pillars, you will realize that the bowls are composed of the network, the chainwork, the lilies, and the pomegranates. The pomegranates are not on the base of the capital, but on the chainwork surrounding the bowls. The network covers the bowls, the chainwork surrounds the bowls, the pomegranates are upon the chainwork, and the lily grows upon the network. All these things together are the bowl. If you consider this in the light of your experience, you will realize that through the crossing out by the network and the restriction of the chainwork, you live as a lily to express the riches of the life of Christ. This is a living testimony coming out of the process of resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQbrUhrmREHTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> In our homes we are in the checkerwork and held by the chainwork. This is also true with the brothers and sisters in the church. Those who serve in the business office have undoubtedly experienced the checkerwork and the chainwork there. Surely in the business office there is much checkerwork and chainwork. But along with the checkerwork and the chainwork, there are also the three days. All those who serve in the business office are on the way of the three days, that is, they are in the process of resurrection. </p>

<p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXQ2jNfpYi443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> In this message, a parenthesis in our study of the pillars, we shall consider Hiram, the builder of the pillars (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30425" data-verses="1Kings 7:13-15">1 Kings 7:13-15</span>). In 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles the Bible has much to say about Hiram. Although David and Solomon both prepared skillful men for the building of the temple, Hiram is the only one of these skillful builders mentioned by name. The Bible not only mentions Hiram’s name, but also gives his background in a detailed and meaningful way, telling us of his mother and father and of Hiram himself. As we study the Bible, we must realize that it has no wasted words. Everything it stresses or repeats is meaningful. Instead of considering some verse as mere repetition, we must find the significance in each repetition. </p>
<p data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkw9BGeMnOoPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU"> When I spent much time studying the two pillars in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30426" data-verses="1Kings 7:1">1 Kings 7</span> nearly fifty years ago, I did not see any light. I only saw that the names of the two pillars were Jachin, meaning, “He shall establish,” and Boaz, meaning, “In it is strength.” But as we have been considering Jacob’s dream and his experience at Bethel, I began to study these two pillars again. This time a great deal of light, like the fourth-day light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30427" data-verses="Genesis 1:14-19">1:14-19</span>), shined upon me. In my study of the pillars I found that many verses mention Hiram, the builder of the pillars. I knew by the speaking of the Spirit within that I had to pay attention to this. While I was considering the pillars, light also came concerning Hiram’s mother and father, neither of whom is named in the Scriptures. I was especially bothered by the fact that, according to the Hebrew text, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30428" data-verses="1Kings 7:14">1 Kings 7:14</span> says that Hiram was of the tribe of Naphtali. As I considered <span class="pg" data-page-id="1092" id="1092">[1092]</span> all these things further, I realized that I needed one complete message to discharge my burden on the builder of the pillars. </p>
<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6N6FaaGr9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> When you hear about the builder of the pillars, you may say, “I don’t think that I could ever be a builder. As long as God’s mercy and grace would make me a pillar, I would be more than satisfied.” But do not be so limited. God’s grace is unlimited. It can not only make you a pillar, but even a builder of pillars. Although I am not saying that all of us will be pillars or builders of pillars, I believe that in the coming years many, even some sisters, will become pillars. If you do not believe this word now, I would ask you to wait for several years. Then you will see many pillars raised up in the Lord’s recovery. When that time comes, I will be happy. Furthermore, I believe that a good number of us will also become Hirams, the builders of pillars. God needs these Hirams. Only one temple was built in Solomon’s time, but today many local churches need to be built. How many Hirams will be required for this work! Every local church needs at least one Hiram. Whenever there is a Hiram in a local church, that church is in glory. Thank the Lord that He has raised up a number of Hirams in the past. But I believe that in the future the Lord will perfect many more Hirams. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjK9YH-HBcGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD">I. HIS MOTHER BEING A WOMAN<br/>OF THE DAUGHTERS OF DAN</h2><p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qfGNIz7JdzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> Let us now see the constituent, or the constitution, of a Hiram. We need to know the constitution of those who are builders, not of the building generally, but of the pillars specifically. Firstly, Hiram’s mother was “a woman of the daughters of Dan” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30429" data-verses="2Chronicles 2:14">2 Chron. 2:14</span>). No one can tell whether Dan here refers to the tribe of Dan or to the city of Dan. Nonetheless, it is certain that it refers to people from Dan, for the city of Dan was also of the people of the tribe of Dan. Hiram’s father was a Tyrian, a man of Tyre, a pagan country. Hence, Hiram’s mother was from the holy land and his father from a pagan country. As strange as it seems, the Bible further says that Hiram himself was of the tribe of Naphtali (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30430" data-verses="1Kings 7:14">1 Kings 7:14</span>, Heb.). Therefore, his mother was of Dan, his father was of Tyre, and he himself was of Naphtali. How could he be of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1093" id="1093">[1093]</span> tribe of Naphtali, since his mother was of Dan and his father of Tyre? The Bible does not tell us. It is a secret. In the light of the New Testament we may apprehend the significance of this secret. The New Testament unveils to us that we were born a sinful and worldly man. But we have been regenerated and transformed to be a man in resurrection. To be a man in resurrection by being regenerated and transformed is to be transferred into the tribe of “Naphtali” and to no longer be of “Dan” or of “Tyre.” </p>
<p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6Kabz1nRfTe1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> Let us take the example of an elder who has been transformed. An elder should not be a gentleman, but a transformed man. Although a certain elder is the son of a woman from “Dan” and of a man from “Tyre,” he must be transferred into a person from the tribe of “Naphtali.” In the church life the tribe of “Naphtali” is the tribe of transformation. Once we are in the tribe of “Naphtali,” we are no longer the same as our “Danite” mother and our “Tyrian” father. You may think it is too much to say that Naphtali may be interpreted as the tribe of transformation. But read on, and surely you will be convinced that this is so. Among the twelve tribes, only one tribe, the tribe of Naphtali, is the tribe of transformation. Judah is the tribe of kingship, Levi of priesthood, and Joseph of the double portion. Naphtali is the tribe of resurrection. To be in resurrection means to be in transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_QQA1DalgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> The tribe of Dan is the tribe of idolatry that caused God’s people to stumble and fall from God’s way. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30431" data-verses="Genesis 49:17">Genesis 49:17</span> says, “Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30432" data-verses="Judges 18:1">Judges 18</span>, this is exactly what the Danites did. They took Micah’s images which he had in his house and the priest whom Micah had hired to serve in his house. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30433" data-verses="Judges 18:31">Judges 18:31</span> says, “They set them up Micah’s graven image, which he made.” This was the greatest stumbling to the children of Israel; it was the biting of the adder that caused the rider to fall backward. Furthermore, Jeroboam, the king of the northern tribes, set up golden calves in Bethel and in Dan to cause the children of God to stumble (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30434" data-verses="1Kings 12:28-30">1 Kings 12:28-30</span>). Due to this, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30435" data-verses="1Chronicles 2:1-9">1 Chronicles 2 through 9</span>, where all the other tribes of Israel are mentioned in detail, there is no mention of Dan. In <span class="pg" data-page-id="1094" id="1094">[1094]</span> these chapters Dan is cut off from the record of God’s people. Moreover, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30436" data-verses="Revelation 7:1">Revelation 7</span>, where we have the sealing of the children of Israel, there is no mention of the tribe of Dan. </p>
<p data-content-id="prNfLWZ9JdrW7yTc3YS3U9PL_qhGoK-lAf5XbjI5e4-Pr6RDr_aquY_gO4K9YJN2U"> Let us consider further some details relating to the tribe of Dan. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30437" data-verses="Genesis 49:17">Genesis 49:17</span> says that Dan was “a serpent by the way, an adder in the path.” Dan was an adder, a poisonous snake, biting the horse’s heels, “so that his rider shall fall backward.” In the race of God’s economy, this adder bites the horse and causes the rider to fall backward. This word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30438" data-verses="Genesis 49:17">49:17</span> was not spoken by a slanderer; it was uttered by Jacob as part of his blessing of his sons. When it was time to bestow his blessing upon Dan, Jacob had to be faithful to God’s inspiration. Immediately after speaking the words recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30439" data-verses="Genesis 49:17">49:17</span>, Jacob said, “I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.” This means, “Lord, save me from this serpent, this adder.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30440" data-verses="Genesis 49:16">49:16</span> Jacob said, “Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.” Here, Jacob was praying that Dan might continue as a tribe. This indicated that he was in danger of being omitted. Hence, his father’s prayer was also a prediction. God heard this prayer. In the book of Ezekiel we see that in the coming millennium the tribe of Dan will be recovered (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30441" data-verses="Ezekiel 48:1">Ezek. 48:1</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="0JV8hDILxxkbeRl9MfljI69jqw_FVL0iYCHdxKUekJ14F8oFrW_U5yl_qzhcrk_AB"> In this message we shall consider further the builder of the pillars, the skillful Hiram (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30481" data-verses="1Kings 7:13-14">1 Kings 7:13-14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30482" data-verses="2Chronicles 2:13-14">2 Chron. 2:13-14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYQos0VlYlMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx"> It is not easy to know the Bible. Sometimes when translators have difficulty with a particular passage, they assume that the manuscripts are in error. However, when we probe into the depths of the revelation of the Bible, we must worship God. Often what at first glance appears to be a mistake in the manuscripts turns out to be a mysterious truth hidden in the Scriptures. This is true with respect to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30483" data-verses="1Kings 7:14">1 Kings 7:14</span>. The King James Version renders the verse as, “He [Hiram] was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali.” According to this rendering and the understanding of most translators, the modifier, “of the tribe of Naphtali,” goes with the word “widow.” This would mean that this verse says that the widow was of the tribe of Naphtali. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30484" data-verses="2Chronicles 2:14">2 Chronicles 2:14</span> says that Hiram was “the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan.” How could a daughter of Dan also be of the tribe of Naphtali? Some translators, neglecting the Hebrew text of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30485" data-verses="1Kings 7:14">1 Kings 7:14</span>, tried their best to reconcile this discrepancy, but they failed. By studying the Hebrew text we have learned that this verse should be translated as follows: “The son of a widowed woman; and he was of the tribe of Naphtali.” Thus, Hiram, the son, was of the tribe of Naphtali. This solves the problem. </p>
<p data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZiw_rUhsp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6"> In this record of Hiram, the pillar builder, we have three peoples: the people of Dan, the people of Tyre, and the people of Naphtali. Hiram’s mother was of Dan, his father was of Tyre, and he himself became one of the tribe of Naphtali. We <span class="pg" data-page-id="1106" id="1106">[1106]</span> do not know how a man whose mother was of Dan and whose father was of Tyre could be of the tribe of Naphtali. We only know that the Bible tells us so. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BLE5KA_UJUWmNHemF8RznOi2epIh0O1klPDPPz_cM4ETPjCdTs_KDy-6YMjsxBV2U">VI. HIRAM’S TRANSFER TO THE TRIBE<br/>OF NAPHTALI BEING MYSTERIOUS</h2><p data-content-id="x52sBK0RPP8CO8qDhR2srpPOtl0q0DNKTmsXdJCAVgGjfw6s5s9H5KtPnduIvZkRU"> The Bible is profound, and many things revealed in it are mysterious. Although there seems to be no reason for Hiram to be of the tribe of Naphtali, the Bible clearly tells that he was of this tribe. If we consider the significance of Dan, Tyre, and Naphtali, we shall worship God. Dan was a people of the serpent that bit the horse in the race of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30486" data-verses="Genesis 49:17">Gen. 49:17</span>), and Tyre, a center filled with commerce, was related to Satan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30487" data-verses="Ezekiel 28:12">Ezek. 28:12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30488" data-verses="Ezekiel 28:16">16</span>). How marvelous that a man born of a woman of the people of the serpent and of a man of the people related to Satan could eventually become one of the tribe of Naphtali. </p>
<p data-content-id="E-xv1nlZl2LrnNkDtbmzOdoqduSStUIFb3C0mvDz1LtjokSWkphwKc-Ng-yoBiibt"> Naphtali is a hind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30489" data-verses="Genesis 49:21">Gen. 49:21</span>), which is useful to God. The description of the hind in the Old Testament record is very significant. According to the Bible, a hind signifies a person who trusts in God when he is in a desperate situation. Due to this trust, the Lord causes him to walk, even to skip, upon the high places (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30490" data-verses="Habakkuk 3:17-19">Hab. 3:17-19</span>). The title of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30491" data-verses="Psalms 22:1">Psalm 22</span> reveals that the hind also signifies the very Christ who, having passed through the suffering of crucifixion, has entered into resurrection for the sake of the church. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30492" data-verses="Hebrews 2:11-12">Hebrews 2:11 and 12</span> reveal that the resurrected Christ is for the church. Therefore, the hind signifies a person who trusts in God, who walks upon the mountaintops, and who lives by the resurrected Christ for God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2wiWOYwNY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df"> Which do you prefer to be—a serpent, a “Tyrian,” or a hind? I certainly prefer to be one of the tribe of Naphtali, trusting in God, walking upon the high places, and living in the resurrected Christ for God’s building. Hiram was such a person. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ss-Kv9Ptsxb3Hpm3OLvQWRAK3WUZkwLJkPM-9Yo5gpNrugTwkZhE_qWQlLbkcq0fN"> When some read this, they may think that it is merely allegorization or inference. It is not wrong to make inferences. If we see the letters b-o-y, we may rightly infer that they spell the word “boy.” This inference is not only correct, but also <span class="pg" data-page-id="1107" id="1107">[1107]</span> necessary. In order to make inferences related to what is found in the Bible, we must firstly know the Bible. Many who do not know the significance of the tribe of Dan or of the country of Tyre would say, “Dan is Dan and Tyre is Tyre. We don’t care for all these things.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30493" data-verses="Genesis 49:21">Genesis 49:21</span> says, “Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth beautiful words” (Heb.). Perhaps you have never paid attention to this verse. Naphtali is a hind that is released and freed. This hind knows no bondage and is not held in any fold; rather, it is freed to skip on the mountaintops. We must be such persons, persons who are freed from every bondage and man-made fold. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUDsBBjBPjRtaf2PAgd0RK2OJne1KXdsQrQ3vEcVWKTvzkKR8PehPPTdnoCg5OrXo"> Now we must ask how a man born of a Danite mother and a Tyrian father could become one of the tribe of Naphtali. It is mysterious. A portion of the personal history of every Christian should be mysterious. Every Christian has a mysterious history. When I was young, I enjoyed playing soccer. I could play soccer all day long. But when I went to play again after I was saved, a strange thing happened. As I waited for the ball to come my way, I found that my feet would not move. When the ball did come to me, I simply could not play. Formerly, I was the fastest one in running and carrying the ball, but now I could not move and I eventually withdrew from the game. Others were shocked, and some said, “What happened?” I answered, “It is difficult for me to say.” This is mysterious. Have you not had mysterious experiences like this? If not, then I doubt that you are my brother or sister in the Lord. Although I was a natural born soccer player, I suddenly became another person. For about fifty-five years I have not returned to play soccer. </p>
<p data-content-id="e4Tu7RSEEn956Bu43KIdFutJenEhLhbqE99G8qhMhliWdoAMPEcx2IgxrawDytCgr"> There is a mysterious element in our regenerated life. Yes, we were born of a “Danite” mother and of a “Tyrian” father, but we have been regenerated to be another person. Even the young ones among us can testify that certain mysterious things have happened to them. Part of their human history is mysterious. The more you take this way, the more mysterious you will become. My wife has to admit that many times she cannot understand me. On occasion, something causes anger to rise up in me, but a few minutes later I begin to say, “O Lord Jesus! Praise the Lord! Amen!” Although my wife <span class="pg" data-page-id="1108" id="1108">[1108]</span> exercises her ability to understand what is going on within me, she simply cannot fathom what happens to me. Because this is so mysterious, I can only say, “Praise the Lord!” How mysterious this is! </p>
<p data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_LXPSUOBIw3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj"> Both Dan and Tyre are visible, but Naphtali is invisible. People could see that I was born of my natural mother and father, but they could not see how I became such a mysterious person. Every spiritual “Naphtalite” is invisible and mysterious. People should not be entirely able to understand you. If your classmates in school can understand everything about you, you are finished. You are not a wonderful Christian, for a wonderful Christian should not be that understandable. Instead, you should be a puzzle to your classmates or those with whom you work. You must also be a mysterious person in your married life. Although your dear wife may be a good sister, you should be somewhat mysterious in her eyes. If you are not mysterious, I do not believe that you are a good brother. The sisters should likewise be somewhat mysterious to their husbands. Before the Lord, I can testify that I do not understand certain things about my wife. She should not be able to bear so much, but due to the mysterious life within her she is able to bear much more than I think. We Christians have a mysterious source and origin. We even have a mysterious Originator within us. </p>

<p data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnAno80WjEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB"> We have seen that Jacob twice set up a pillar in Bethel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30505" data-verses="Genesis 28:18">28:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30506" data-verses="Genesis 28:22">22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30507" data-verses="Genesis 35:14">35:14</span>). Not only did he set up a pillar, but he called it “the house of God.” As we have pointed out again and again, nearly every item in the book of Genesis is a seed of a truth developed in the following books of the Bible. Knowing this principle is basic to our understanding of the book of Genesis. If we would understand this book, we must follow the development of the items it contains throughout the following books of the Bible until they reach their ultimate consummation in the book of Revelation. In past messages we have considered the development of the pillar in 1 Kings, 2 Chronicles, and Jeremiah. Now we shall trace this development into the New Testament, where we have a clear word regarding three aspects of pillars: the apostles as pillars of the church, the church as a whole being the pillar, and the overcomers as pillars in the New Jerusalem. </p>

<p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQbrUtrkF8HTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30508" data-verses="Galatians 2:9">Galatians 2:9</span> says that James, Cephas, and John were reputed to be pillars. Here Peter is called Cephas. We know that Cephas was Peter and that Peter was Cephas. In using the name Cephas in this verse, the Bible reminds us of the change of Peter’s name. When Peter was first brought to the Lord, He changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which means a stone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30509" data-verses="John 1:42">John 1:42</span>). Undoubtedly, this change of name indicated that the Lord’s intention was to transform him into <span class="pg" data-page-id="1120" id="1120">[1120]</span> a stone for God’s building. Although we are accustomed to reading of Peter and John, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30510" data-verses="Galatians 2:9">Galatians 2:9</span> Paul purposely speaks of Cephas and John to show us that, if we would become pillars, we need to be transformed. The natural Simon must be transformed into a Cephas, a stone. </p>
<p data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYgypEscU65oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa"> Now we must consider the question of how a natural man can become a pillar of the church. This can only be accomplished through transformation. According to the New Testament, transformation depends upon regeneration. By regeneration a new life is put into us. This life is a life that will transform us. By our natural birth we inherited an old, sinful, natural life. This life is absolutely useless in making us pillars. But thank the Lord that regeneration imparts into us a life different from our natural life. This new life is the divine life, the very life of God. In the Gospel of John this life is called eternal life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30511" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>). The eternal life sown into us at the time of our regeneration is the seed of transformation. Hallelujah, all the regenerated ones have received this divine life! We all have this seed of transformation. However, although many Christians devote a great deal of attention to regeneration, very few pay attention to transformation. Few Christians have ever heard a message about transformation, and there may even be some among us who have never prayed for their own transformation. I strongly urge you to pray for your transformation. Formerly, we needed regeneration; now we need transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-ytt2f6AKBFlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo"> A human being is composed of three parts: spirit, soul, and body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30512" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">1 Thes. 5:23</span>). When we believed in the Lord Jesus, called on His name, applied His blood, and received Him as our Redeemer and our life, the divine Spirit entered into our spirit as the Spirit of life. As a result, we were regenerated and received the divine life, which was sown into the depths of our being as the seed of transformation. But what about our soul, which is composed of the mind, the will, and the emotion? We have the divine life in our spirit, but we still need to be transformed in our mind. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30513" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Romans 12:2</span> proves this: “Be transformed by the renewing of the mind.” Transformation takes place through the renewing of our mind, emotion, and will. These basic inner parts of our being need <span class="pg" data-page-id="1121" id="1121">[1121]</span> transformation. This transformation will make us stones for God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXQ2jFfocO443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> Through regeneration plus transformation we become stones for God’s building. Today, God’s building is the church, God’s house, God’s temple. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30514" data-verses="1Peter 2:4-5">First Peter 2:4 and 5</span> reveal that Christ is the living stone and that, when we, the regenerated ones, come to Him, we also become living stones to be built up into a spiritual house, which is the church as the temple of God. Today God’s building is the church, but in the future it will be the New Jerusalem. If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30515" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span> carefully, we shall see that the New Jerusalem will be the enlargement of the temple of God. Today, the temple of God is a house, but in eternity the temple of God will be a city, which of course is much greater than a house. The New Jerusalem will be built with precious stones (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30516" data-verses="Revelation 21:18-20">Rev. 21:18-20</span>); in it there will be no dust, clay, or wood. Our destiny is to be precious stones built into the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkw9BOeNTuoPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU"> Now we come to the crucial matter of how clay can be transformed into stone. We were made clay (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30517" data-verses="Genesis 2:7">2:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30518" data-verses="Romans 9:21">Rom. 9:21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30519" data-verses="Romans 9:23">23</span>), but the New Testament reveals that we are stones. There seems to be a contradiction here. From the natural perspective we are clay, but from the spiritual, transformed perspective we are stones. But how does this transformation from clay to stone take place? Transformation is the adding of Christ into our being. To be transformed is not only to have Christ imparted into our spirit; it is to have Him spread from our spirit into every inward part of our being. Very few Christians have seen this. </p>
<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6N6NabiP9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> Recently, I was told of a group of Christians who argue strongly that Christ is only in the third heaven and that He is not in us. The Bible reveals and we also preach that Christ today is in the third heaven at the right hand of God. Nevertheless, He is also in us. Both matters are covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30520" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30521" data-verses="Romans 8:34">Romans 8:34</span> says that Christ is at the right hand of God interceding for us, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30522" data-verses="Romans 8:10">Romans 8:10</span> says that Christ is in us. Hence, Christ is both in heaven and in us. But these Christians ask, “Was not Christ resurrected with a body of flesh and bones? Since Christ has been resurrected with a body of flesh and bones, how could He get into you?” According to <span class="pg" data-page-id="1122" id="1122">[1122]</span> the Bible, we definitely believe that Christ was resurrected physically with a body of flesh and bones (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30523" data-verses="Luke 24:39">Luke 24:39</span>). But listen to this: On the day of resurrection the resurrected Christ, having a body of flesh and bones, came into a locked room (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30524" data-verses="John 20:19-20">John 20:19-20</span>). How did He get into the room? He certainly did not appear as a ghost (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30525" data-verses="Luke 24:37">Luke 24:37</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30526" data-verses="Luke 24:39">39</span>). We must reverently confess that we cannot figure out this matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjK9QH8T5cGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30527" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">Colossians 1:27</span> says, “Christ in you, the hope of glory.” Although Christ was resurrected with a body of flesh and bones, He became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30528" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>). As the life-giving Spirit, Christ is in our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30529" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">2 Tim. 4:22</span>). Furthermore, Christ is growing and increasing within us. The more Christ is added into us, the more we are transformed from clay into stone. I doubt that those who refuse to admit that Christ is in them are able to be transformed. They surely could not deliver a message on transformation. But we are not simply concerned for messages—we are concerned for transformation. We need to be transformed, and transformation is only possible by having Christ imparted into us each day. Morning after morning, we need to gain more of Christ. Each day Christ must be increasingly added into our being. </p>
<p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qfGFIx_1dzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> Consider the example of Peter, a Galilean fisherman. Peter was rough, uncultured, and of a quick disposition. He was quick to talk, quick to act, and quick to make mistakes. Peter also had the good point of being quick to repent, to return. The Peter in the Gospels was eventually changed into another person called Cephas in the Epistles. We may take, as an illustration of this, Peter’s slow response to the vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30530" data-verses="Acts 10:9-16">Acts 10:9-16</span>. There is a marked difference between the slow Peter in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30531" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span> and the quick Peter in the Gospels. Furthermore, Peter’s two epistles reveal that he had become a cautious person. By this we see that his disposition had been changed and that his being had been transformed. He had absolutely become another person. His word concerning Paul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30532" data-verses="2Peter 3:15-16">2 Pet. 3:15-16</span>) proves that he had been transformed and had become another person. </p>

The kind of pillar I am talking about, of course, is the pillar in Solomon’s temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30552" data-verses="1Kings 7:13-22">1 Kings 7:13-22</span>), the pillar in Bethel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30553" data-verses="Genesis 28:18">Gen. 28:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30554" data-verses="Genesis 28:22">22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30555" data-verses="Genesis 35:14">35:14</span>). </p>

Otherwise, we shall be seeking the right thing in the wrong place. If we remain in the Catholic Church, the denominations, the charismatic movement, or the free groups, it will be impossible for us to be perfected as pillars. Do not think that such a statement indicates we are being narrow-minded or shortsighted. We must be in today’s Bethel, the church. There is no other place for us to be made pillars in God’s building. The pillars perfected in other places are not pillars for Bethel, God’s building, but for other things. Through the past centuries, some spiritual giants have been perfected to be pillars for the denominations, for the mission fields, or for certain movements. However, through my years of observation, I have not seen any pillars perfected for the Lord’s building outside of the local churches. We must be clear that the pillars about which we are speaking are the genuine pillars for God’s building. If we want to be such a pillar, then we must ask where God’s building, today’s Bethel, is. We should not take this matter lightly. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_LXPqUPl0w3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj">A PERSONAL TESTIMONY</h2><p data-content-id="NgrUOPst9ndCGqPDKS1sPEsS5BbxKLEkyN_8bfWBSPyO-5g1-dnym0-8I86wUsKBc"> In 1933 I was burdened by the Lord, even forced by Him, to give up my job and to serve Him full time. I had not studied <span class="pg" data-page-id="1134" id="1134">[1134]</span> in a Bible school or seminary. At the time I was working in a corporation. When the Lord was dealing with me about giving up my job, I could not eat or sleep well for three weeks. To serve the Lord full time required an extreme exercise of my faith, and nothing in my environment favored this decision. I simply did not know how I would care for my living. Eventually, however, I had no choice except to quit my job. After I made this decision, I received a brief note
from Brother Nee. In this note
Brother Nee said, “Brother Witness, as to your future, I feel that you have to serve the Lord with your full time. How do you feel about it? May the Lord lead you.” This note, dated August 17, 1933, the middle of my three-week struggle with the Lord, was a strong confirmation. I had resigned from the corporation, but I had little faith; I was still doubting that I had made the right decision. At that very juncture, that note
arrived from Brother Nee. After I read it, I said, “The Lord willing, I will visit this brother and find out why he wrote that note
to me at that time.” </p>
<p data-content-id="topU0NZPOs7b25ters3Gd7G9K0mthSqSpV5hz_XoXr_MU93J_kJdBBom0evJv9lGi"> With this purpose in mind, I went to Shanghai to visit Brother Nee, and he received me as his guest. I stayed with him for several months, and I received great help from him. Of course, my first question was why he had written that note
on August 17. He told me that as his boat was sailing back to China on the Mediterranean Sea and he was sitting silently in his cabin alone, he was burdened to pray for the Lord’s move in China. While he was praying, the Lord pointed out to him that he had to write me that note. Then I told him that the date on which he wrote this note
was in the middle of my three-week struggle with the Lord. This report confirmed for Brother Nee that what he had written was absolutely right. Through this note
he and I were builded together even more than before. We were deeply assured that the Lord had put us together. From this time, he treated me as a new learner, and I honored and respected him, my senior co-worker, as one who could perfect me. </p>
<p data-content-id="h08U91ltZnqTUI0aV0g56lyCiI8qCw-cZTKHrVo12qTwS3OgmpjHqkUk9BKO83GId"> Because there was not that much work for Brother Nee and me to do in the early days, I often went to him in his home for long periods of time. At these times he perfected me in many different ways. Before the Lord I can testify that we <span class="pg" data-page-id="1135" id="1135">[1135]</span> never spent any time in gossip. Brother Nee, an outstanding gift given by the Lord to perfect others, always used the time to perfect me. He certainly knew what I needed. He gave me the proper understanding of church history from the first century until the present; he shared with me the biographies of nearly all the founders of the different denominations; and he perfected me with respect to the inner life, the church life, and the Lord’s move. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWKxfBEoatXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS">ONE FLOW</h2><p data-content-id="MtCll2XOY8R8dFgTUXdR4Yds7Xob8JwNRjNJM9TIVoQfsRCA1WYTsZI35lh9oQ1PX"> One day Brother Nee told me that he and the other co-workers were burdened that I move to Shanghai with my family to stay with them and work with them. He asked me to bring this matter to the Lord. As I took the matter to the Lord and prayed about it, the Lord showed me from the book of Acts that in His move on earth there is only one flow. This flow started from Jerusalem and spread to Antioch, and from Antioch it turned to Europe. The Lord told me that for His move in China there should not be two flows or two origins. I had been burdened for north China. Before I had gone to see Brother Nee, I had conducted a thorough study on the Song of Songs in the summer of 1933. But although I was definitely burdened for north China, Brother Nee and the co-workers felt that I should move to Shanghai, stay there, and work with them. At this time the Lord showed me that I had to get into the one flow that had started from Shanghai. I saw that from Shanghai the flow would proceed to the north and to other parts of the country. Therefore, I decided to move to Shanghai and to stay there. From that time onward, I have been in the flow. I have been absolutely clear that this is the Lord’s flow and His move on earth in His recovery. Using today’s word, I knew that I had found Bethel. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Vyv6cezndY8yrw_ApV0zPcEK7F7SJbjcYWxSSt0SaXZR8SPfWLyu4As---ucS3eoN">THE MINISTRY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FLOW</h2><p data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8AfonztgenquNKoc1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq"> Because I knew I was in the Lord’s flow and that this flow had already started, I also realized that there was a ministry responsible for that flow. As the result of seeing this, I strongly decided to forget all my past learning and experience. The fact that I had been able to conduct a detailed study <span class="pg" data-page-id="1136" id="1136">[1136]</span> on Song of Songs indicates that I had some knowledge and that I could do something. I had learned a good deal about the Bible in my seven and a half years with the Brethren. I knew the types, the prophecies, and various other things. Moreover, a church had been established through me. Nevertheless, I realized that the Lord’s flow on the earth must be one, that the flow had already begun, and that there was a ministry carrying on this flow. I knew that I had to be in the flow and to be under the ministry responsible for the flow. </p>
<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6tWv5kN1WapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> Those who were with us in the early years can testify that, apart from the messages I gave in the meetings, I never said anything. In view of the fact that Brother Nee was present, I dropped all my concepts, all my learnings, and all my experiences. He was the one used by the Lord to start the flow, and he had the ministry to carry on the flow. There was no need for my opinion. However, this does not mean that I did nothing. During the next eighteen or twenty years, I did a great deal. But everything was according to Brother Nee’s leading, not according to my opinion. I never ministered anything according to myself; I only ministered the messages delivered by Brother Nee. In those years I never expressed my opinion or concept; instead, I wholly followed Brother Nee. </p>
<p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWjw9C4trQfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> The Lord is flowing in His move on earth. This flow was not started by you, but by others. Furthermore, there is a ministry responsible for the flow. It is difficult for me to speak about this because now the matter is very much related to me. If I were still on the mainland and the flow were related to Brother Nee’s ministry, I would have the ground to say much more. </p>

<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6tWr5lJJWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> At Bethel Jacob did some very significant things. He built an altar, set up a pillar, poured a drink offering upon the pillar, and then poured oil upon the pillar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30556" data-verses="Genesis 35:7">35:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30557" data-verses="Genesis 35:14-15">14-15</span>).

<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWjw9G4sfgfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK">(2) Pouring a Drink Offering upon the Pillar</h2><p data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXkWvdgMy0wrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip"> Remember that nearly every item mentioned in the book of Genesis is the seed of a truth developed in the following books of the Bible. Because <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30558" data-verses="Genesis 35:14">35:14</span> is the first mention of the drink offering, this verse is the seed of the drink offering. If we had only this verse, it would be difficult to know the meaning of the drink offering. In order to understand the significance of the drink offering, we must trace its development in both the Old Testament and in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LmaUKaCDKrZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> We have pointed out that Jacob twice set up a pillar in Bethel. The first time he did not pour a drink offering upon the pillar; he simply poured oil upon it. The reason Jacob poured oil but not wine upon the pillar the first time was that in the Bible oil does not require very much experience on our part, but wine depends upon our experience. At the time of Jacob’s first visit to Bethel, he did not have any experience of the Lord. Rather, he was a young supplanter and had no wine to pour out to the Lord. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30559" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span> he could not pour out the drink offering. But twenty years later, after he had been touched by the Lord and had been somewhat transformed, he returned to Bethel. Because he had had some experience, he had wine to pour out upon the pillar as a <span class="pg" data-page-id="1142" id="1142">[1142]</span> drink offering to the Lord. Please keep in mind that the drink offering is absolutely related to our experience. </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtqKGAiJvD_u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m">(a) In Addition to the Basic Offerings<br/>after the Experience of the Riches of Christ</h2><p data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIIQ_iGwDfD0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs"> Although all the offerings are types of Christ and are for our experience, there is a difference between the basic offerings and the drink offering. The sin offering, one of the basic offerings, was a type of Christ for the experience of sinners. Before sinners come to offer the sin offering, they do not have any experience. They gain experience by presenting the sin offering to God. No experience is required beforehand. Before you can pour out a drink offering, however, you must have a measure of experience. Without experience, you will not be able to have this offering because the drink offering is composed of our experience of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="yObOo7LOjjFarxWXeCIo4OQM-W6LfP03Kiwq9oNdUXzgDgrb2yrYAyxlelIIkT9lp"> In the first seven chapters of Leviticus we have the five basic offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. There is no need to experience Christ before you offer Him as these basic offerings. But the drink offering is absolutely dependent upon our experience. This is quite important. Many believers have no understanding of the basic offerings, much less an understanding of the drink offering. The reason for this is that they are short of the real experiences of Christ. By the Lord’s mercy we in His recovery must experience Christ in a practical, daily way. Daily we should experience Him as our burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, sin offering, and trespass offering. In the beginning we offer Christ only in this way. But as we progress in our experience of Christ, we eventually discover an offering that is in addition to these basic offerings—the drink offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="8UouUokiSDmfQ5btvmO_u_ChcwG0LW5y_xM7y0Cjh31lO6uhzd5IR1LXaUCBwG1Zr"> Suppose a certain man has been saved for just one day. He certainly has had no time to have the experience of Christ. But if he remains in the proper church life, the saints will help him to realize that he needs to live by Christ, taking Christ as his life in a practical way. As he learns to live by Christ, he will gradually realize that Christ is so much to him. The saints will no doubt help him to see that Christ is <span class="pg" data-page-id="1143" id="1143">[1143]</span> his burnt offering. He will realize that he should be absolutely for God; however, he will find that he is not able to be absolute. Nevertheless, Christ is his absoluteness. Through this experience, Christ will become his burnt offering for God’s satisfaction. Furthermore, he will enjoy Christ as his meal offering, as the One who not only satisfies God, but who also feeds and supplies him. Then he will daily take Christ as his food, and Christ will nourish him and support him to live in the presence of God that God might be satisfied. In this way he will experience Christ as the meal offering. In like manner, he will experience the other basic offerings. By experiencing Christ in this way, he will eventually become a person filled and saturated with Christ. The very Christ who saturates him will be his wine, and the brother himself will be saturated with this wine and actually become one with the wine. </p>
<p data-content-id="0JV8hDILxxkbeRl9MfljI69fqx7hVL0iYCHdxKUekJ14F8oFrW_U5yl_qzhcrk_AB"> Some may wonder what ground we have for saying that Christ is wine. This is not my word; it is the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30560" data-verses="Matthew 9:17">Matthew 9:17</span>. In this verse the Lord said, “Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.” The Lord spoke this word in His answer to some disciples of John the Baptist who asked Him why His disciples did not fast (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30561" data-verses="Matthew 9:14">Matt. 9:14</span>). The Lord wisely answered their question in a marvelous way with two parables. Firstly, He said, “No one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30562" data-verses="Matthew 9:16">Matt. 9:16</span>). Secondly, He spoke about not putting new wine into old wineskins. What is this new cloth and new wine? Both the new cloth and the new wine are Christ. The new cloth is Christ as our new, unique, complete, and perfect righteousness for us to be justified before God. As the new cloth Christ is our righteousness to cover us. The new wine is Christ as the stirring life, as the life that stirs us up to make us happy and even “crazy.” To be “crazy” is to be drunken. Christ as the new cloth covers us outwardly and Christ as the new wine stirs us and makes us <span class="pg" data-page-id="1144" id="1144">[1144]</span> “crazy” inwardly. In other words, Christ causes us to be drunken. All Christians must be “crazy” like this. </p>
<p data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYQosIVksdMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx"> In the summer of 1935 Brother Nee stayed in my home town. During this time we had a conference in which we were all “crazy.” Brother Nee did not stir us up to be “crazy”; we were “crazy” already. When he saw how “crazy” we were, he gave us a supplementary message telling us that we all need to be “crazy,” beside ourselves (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30563" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:13">2 Cor. 5:13</span>). He said that if any Christian has never been “crazy,” then he is not yet up to standard. He said, “If you are always nice, formal, gentle, and regulated, you are below standard. You must be ‘crazy’ in the Lord like a drunkard.” </p>
<p data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZiwDrVFQp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6"> Most Christians today are cold, quiet, and dead. The dead are formal and never make mistakes. The most regulated place on earth is a cemetery. Everyone there is quiet and orderly and never disturbs others. Most Christians are like this. Although they think this is beautiful, it is actually dreadful; it is a stench. Christians should be living. The reason many are not living is that they are short of the experiences of Christ. If we experience Christ day after day, eventually the Christ we experience will become wine in us. The more we experience Christ, the “crazier” we shall become. Since the time you were saved, how often have you been “crazy” in your fellowship with the Lord? Have you ever been in a state where you were so happy that you were not able to control yourself, even beside yourself with joy? Have you ever been so joyful that you did not know whether to jump, to dance, or to shout? The more we are “crazy” like this with the Lord, the better. Not only the young people, but even the older brothers and sisters should be “crazy” in their inner chamber with the Lord. As we are with the Lord, we must say, “Oh, what joy! What wine! I simply cannot stand it!” This is the experience of Christ as wine. </p>

<p data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD0VuZ0DPfiWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP"> After remaining in Bethel for quite a long time, Jacob journeyed on from there (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30591" data-verses="Genesis 35:16">35:16</span>). Apparently, this journey away from Bethel was not a positive move. But Jacob’s leaving Bethel does not mean that he left the house of God; it means that he was going on in his spiritual experience. Although he had come to Bethel, had stayed there, and had done certain things there, he still had to go on. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROmJD1TkX2OlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX"> We have seen that Genesis is a book of seeds and pictures. We need to understand the significance of all these seeds and pictures. The picture of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is a portrait of our spiritual life. The experience of these three men is a picture of the spiritual life of one person following the Lord. </p>

<p data-content-id="CAIiqFyjjgw0LbNxWLi5D_of-yyGcXq_WajUO0fMiI1qsIetqtq6bkTvknnO7bFYb"> As Jacob was journeying on from Bethel, he experienced a very deep and personal dealing: his beloved wife, Rachel, died as she was giving birth to Jacob’s last son, Benjamin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30592" data-verses="Genesis 35:16-20">35:16-20</span>). This experience was a matter related to both death and birth, a matter of both loss and gain. Jacob lost Rachel and gained Benjamin. If you had to make the choice, would you prefer to keep the mother or to gain the son? The popular Christian concept is to have both the mother and the son. But in the divine economy, if you would gain the last son, you must let go of the mother. Without loss there can be no gain, and without death there can be no birth. Birth comes out of death, for apart from death there is no resurrection. If Rachel had not died, Benjamin could never have come forth. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1154" id="1154">[1154]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LmaEuaAXirZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> Rachel represents Jacob’s natural choice. Although Jacob had four wives, only Rachel was the natural and original choice according to the desire of Jacob’s heart. He was forced to accept Leah and also constrained to take the two maids, Bilhah and Zilpah. But Leah and the two maids were not the choice of Jacob’s heart. If you read Genesis carefully, you will see that Jacob’s heart was absolutely set on Rachel; he had no heart for the other three. Recall what Jacob did when he feared an attack of Esau and his men. He put the two handmaids and their children at the front, followed by Leah and her children in the middle, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30593" data-verses="Genesis 33:1-2">33:1-2</span>). The fact that Jacob placed Rachel and Joseph at the rear to protect them in case of attack reveals that Jacob’s heart was set on Rachel. </p>
<p data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtqKWkiLrv_u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m"> Everything in the Bible is purposeful. The death of Rachel is recorded here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30594" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span> with a definite purpose. As Jacob was taking his journey, he must have been joyful knowing that Rachel was pregnant again. Perhaps he expected his beloved wife to give him another boy. But as Rachel was giving birth to her second child, she died, and Jacob’s natural choice, the desire of his heart, was taken away from him. </p>
<p data-content-id="6CXs4WE0BL6-B1B4FDiAFpZMue3XzGKjTYJeRnGmeXBe72gXmUfpgBoC9qhDjO81n"> Before the experience at Bethel, God tolerated Jacob’s natural choice, allowing him to have his heart’s desire. But after the experience at Bethel, his natural choice was taken from him. Many of us can testify that before we experienced the church life, we still had our natural concept, natural choice, and natural desire. God even bestowed His blessing upon them. Consider, for example, the birth of Rachel’s first child, Joseph. When Joseph was born, Jacob was very happy and might have said, “This is God’s blessing upon the desire of my heart. God has blessed my choice.” However, after his experience at Bethel, Jacob lost his natural choice. </p>
<p data-content-id="R_GfdTPWaEiXNNW82-yDaVV7DhuiLG6UWYb4K416h7Rart6vExDqqOyU38XwPBejO"> After you experience the church life, your natural choice must be left behind. Before you came into the church, you still had your natural choice, and God tolerated it. But after experiencing the church life to a certain extent, God will tolerate it no longer. I hope that this will not frighten the young people and cause them to draw back from the experience at <span class="pg" data-page-id="1155" id="1155">[1155]</span> Bethel. When they hear about this, some may say, “If this will happen, I will never come to Bethel. Rather, I will stay on the other side of Bethel and go no further. Then I will not lose my natural choice.” Yes, after you have had some experience at Bethel, you will lose your natural choice, but you will gain Benjamin, who is a type of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="sHB9QAVlSM3v0XjManno-kQ8rmHHfHA5fTkqfQSTHo75EQs1z1Iu7LXCJgPqSPnNs">(1) Bringing In Christ as the Son of Sorrow (Benoni)<br/>and as the Son of the Right Hand (Benjamin)</h2><p data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XQ55PdprYw1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30595" data-verses="Genesis 35:18">Verse 18</span> says, “And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died,) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.” This child was given two names, one from his mother and one from his father. Benoni means “the son of sorrow.” Rachel gave him this name because she was suffering and in sorrow. But Jacob immediately changed his name to Benjamin, which means “the son of the right hand.” In this whole universe there is only One who is both the Son of sorrow and the Son of the right hand—and that One is Christ. On the one hand Christ is Benoni, and on the other hand He is Benjamin. Christ is a wonderful Person with these two aspects. No one has suffered as much sorrow as Christ, and no one has been exalted as high as Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30596" data-verses="Isaiah 53:3">Isaiah 53:3</span> describes Him as “a man of sorrows,” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30597" data-verses="Acts 2:33">Acts 2:33</span> says that He has been “exalted to the right hand of God,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30598" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span> says that He is seated “on the right hand of the Majesty on high.” Firstly, Jesus was the Son of sorrow, the Son of suffering. Rachel was not the only one to experience this sorrow; Mary, the mother of Christ, also experienced it. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30599" data-verses="Luke 2:35">Luke 2:35</span>, her soul was pierced by the sufferings of her son. But after thirty-three and a half years, in resurrection and ascension Christ became the Son of the right hand of God. Hence, no one can deny that Benjamin was a type of the suffering and exalted Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="LD01-v3um3NuLShGttlViomSnW7cRg9jsTHcyuTXlEDKbBHncuqREEkOSwGaFv9xn"> Suppose you had been Jacob. Would you have been willing to gain this Christ at the cost of losing the desire of your heart? As long as you stay in the church, experience Bethel, set up a pillar, and pour yourself out upon it as a drink offering, you will have no choice. Rachel must die that Benjamin <span class="pg" data-page-id="1156" id="1156">[1156]</span> might be born. Hallelujah, Rachel has gone and Benjamin has come! </p>
<p data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD0VuZ0CLriWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP"> More than fifty years ago, I heard messages and read books about expressing Christ and manifesting Him. But I was bothered by the fact that I did not know how to lift up Christ or to express Him. For many years I was not able to find the way. Some said that in order to express Christ we must be crucified. But how can a person crucify himself? It is impossible for anyone to nail himself to the cross. Eventually I learned that the way to lift up Christ and to express Him is in the church life. Through the church life “Rachel” will have a marvelous and encouraging delivery, dying that the wonderful Christ may come forth. I have tried every way to uplift and express Christ, and I can testify strongly that none of these ways has been effective. However, after I came to the church and stayed here for a period of time, my “Rachel,” my natural choice, was taken away, and Benjamin was brought forth. </p>

Although Jacob set up pillars four times, he erected them in just three places—at Gilead, at Bethel, and on the way to Bethlehem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30631" data-verses="Genesis 31:45">31:45</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30632" data-verses="Genesis 28:18">28:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30633" data-verses="Genesis 28:22">22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30634" data-verses="Genesis 35:14">35:14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30635" data-verses="Genesis 35:20">20</span>). Because Jacob set up pillars in three places, twice setting up a pillar at Bethel, there were actually three pillars in his life as landmarks of his experience. In addition to these three pillars, Jacob also experienced a tower, the tower of Eder (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30636" data-verses="Genesis 35:21">35:21</span>). We must believe that everything recorded in the Bible has a special significance. In this message we must consider, as a parenthesis, the significance of the three pillars and the one tower in Jacob’s life. </p>

<p data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnmUdkK7MvQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM"> The three pillars set up by Jacob were landmarks in his life. They divided his life into three sections. In the first section Jacob experienced God’s care. From the day of his birth, he was under God’s care. However, Jacob, a supplanter, a heel-holder, thought he was under his own care. Eventually he realized that he was not under his own care, but under God’s care. If Jacob had been under his own care, he would not have been able to deal with his cunning uncle, Laban, or to confront his strong brother, Esau. Rather, he would have been totally defeated by Laban or absolutely destroyed by Esau. But because Jacob was under God’s care, neither Laban nor Esau could harm him. Although Jacob did everything possible to take care of himself, he gradually learned that he was under God’s care. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1166" id="1166">[1166]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-ytt2PiAIVtlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo"> Recall how Jacob left Laban. He did not leave in a glorious way; rather he was afraid of Laban and stole away from him in a somewhat shameful manner (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30637" data-verses="Genesis 31:20-21">31:20-21</span>). In doing so “Jacob stole the heart of Laban the Syrian” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30638" data-verses="Genesis 31:20">31:20</span>, Heb.). Thinking that he had to flee for his own protection, Jacob secretly stole away from Laban. Later Jacob realized that he was not protected by his skill, but by God’s care. Although Laban did not know of Jacob’s flight until three days later, he still pursued him until he caught up with him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30639" data-verses="Genesis 31:23">31:23</span>). The night before Laban overtook Jacob, God said to him, “Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob from good to bad” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30640" data-verses="Genesis 31:24">31:24</span>, Heb.). God seemed to be telling Laban, “Don’t do anything to Jacob. You must leave him in My hands.” Laban was unwise in relating to Jacob what God had told him the previous night (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30641" data-verses="Genesis 31:29">31:29</span>). If Laban had not divulged this, he could have made a deal with Jacob. Jacob used what God had told Laban as the ground to rebuke him, saying, “Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30642" data-verses="Genesis 31:42">31:42</span>). As Jacob was rebuking Laban, deep in his heart he might have felt grateful to God for protecting him. God was sovereign over all his circumstances for his existence. </p>
<p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXQ2zdfqYi443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> Laban then said to Jacob, “Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30643" data-verses="Genesis 31:44">31:44</span>). Jacob responded to Laban’s proposal by taking a stone and setting it up for a pillar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30644" data-verses="Genesis 31:45">31:45</span>). Although Laban intended to pile up a heap of stones, Jacob set up a pillar. This pillar was a testimony of God’s care of Jacob. Jacob had come to see that his living was altogether under the care of God. Hence, he set up this pillar as a strong testimony of God’s care for him. </p>
<p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2OxaInS9iDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> Jacob was under God’s care for more than twenty years. Although he was in Laban’s squeezing hand for such a long time (Laban changed his wages ten times—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30645" data-verses="Genesis 31:41">31:41</span>), God was with him all the while, and His hand was upon him. Therefore, as Jacob was making a deal with Laban, he set up a pillar to testify that he was under God’s care. This pillar was <span class="pg" data-page-id="1167" id="1167">[1167]</span> for Jacob’s existence. Many of us have also set up such a pillar. If you consider your own Christian experience, you will see that the first stage of your Christian life was the stage of experiencing God’s care. Even before we were saved, our intention was to have God’s care. When we heard the good news of the gospel, our intention in believing in the Lord Jesus was to have His care. For many years we, like Jacob, have been under the care of our heavenly Father. At the end of the first stage of our Christian life, we need to set up a pillar testifying of God’s care. However, if you have been with the Lord for quite a long time, it may be too late for you to set up this pillar. Rather, you need to set up the second pillar, the pillar at Bethel. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQeyZHrozFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B">B. The Pillar at Bethel</h2><p data-content-id="QMSNPOcCBLw6v-EOydvwYHFxIvozduX4YH5_O01lRUzkJdbjHu_x8PZ2HwO74uIjb"> Years before Jacob set up this pillar at Gilead, he had set up a pillar at Bethel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30646" data-verses="Genesis 28:18">28:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30647" data-verses="Genesis 28:22">22</span>). However, Jacob set up that pillar immediately after having a dream. Once again we see that Jacob’s biography is also our biography. Not long after we were saved, we heard something about the house of God and we responded to what we heard. But everything we heard and did was like a dream. We did not actually experience the house of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30648" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">Genesis 28</span> Jacob had a dream. After that dream, he had a real experience, not of the house of God, but of the care of God. At the end of this stage of his experience he set up a pillar at Gilead as a landmark to testify of God’s care. As we shall see, in our Christian life we need three pillars, three landmarks, the first of which is the pillar testifying of God’s care for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7Wk7Sel3Z3ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo"> After Jacob had left Padan-aram and had returned to the good land, he did not go directly to Bethel. God had to intervene and call him to Bethel, saying, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30649" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">35:1</span>). This indicates that Jacob had no intention of fulfilling the vow he had made to God at Bethel twenty years earlier. He had probably forgotten it. Instead of journeying directly to Bethel to fulfill his vow, Jacob journeyed to Succoth, where he built a house for himself and made booths <span class="pg" data-page-id="1168" id="1168">[1168]</span> for his cattle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30650" data-verses="Genesis 33:17">33:17</span>). Later he traveled to Shechem, where he bought a parcel of land and spread his tent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30651" data-verses="Genesis 33:18-19">33:18-19</span>). After the serious trouble following the defilement of Jacob’s daughter, Dinah, God came in and told Jacob to arise and to go up to Bethel. When Jacob came to Bethel the second time, he did not have a dream. He had been ordered by God to go there, to dwell there, and to build an altar there to the God who had appeared to him when he was fleeing from Esau. At Bethel Jacob consecrated himself to God so that He might fulfill His purpose of having Bethel, the house of God. Here at Bethel Jacob set up the second pillar, the second landmark in his life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30652" data-verses="Genesis 35:14">35:14</span>). As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30653" data-verses="Genesis 28:22">28:22</span> indicates, the pillar in Bethel was called the house of God. Therefore, the first pillar was a testimony of God’s care, and the second was a testimony of God’s house. </p>

The record of the first thirty-six chapters is brief and emphatic, but the record of the last fourteen chapters is very detailed. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30683" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">Chapter thirty-seven</span>, for example, contains many details. This section is so detailed because it is very practical for our human life. No section in the book of Genesis is more practical than this last section of fourteen chapters. </p>
<p data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIIQvOGx33D0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs"> Before we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30684" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span>, I would like to call your attention back to the beginning of this book. In the reading of any book we must understand the subject, the purpose, of that book. After reading through the book of Genesis, a book of fifty chapters, you still may not know the subject. What is the subject of this book? When I was young, I was told that Genesis covers two main things—God’s creation and man’s fall. Genesis begins with the words, “In the beginning God created,” and it ends with the words, “He was put in a coffin in Egypt.” I was told that because the first verse speaks of God’s creation and the last verse speaks about Joseph’s being put in a coffin in Egypt, Genesis is a book about God’s creation and man’s fall. Although this view is not wrong, it is a very inadequate understanding of this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="yObOo7LOjjFarxWXeCIo4OAg-XenfP03Kiwq9oNdUXzgDgrb2yrYAyxlelIIkT9lp"> It is not easy to understand the Bible. In fact, it is even difficult to understand ourselves. Although we have hair on our heads and ten toes on our feet, do hair and toes make a whole man? Is this a complete person? Certainly not. All the crucial <span class="pg" data-page-id="1180" id="1180">[1180]</span> parts and organs, such as the heart and the lungs, are between the hair and the toes. Likewise, the most important parts of Genesis are between the first verse and the last verse of the book. </p>
<p data-content-id="8UouUokiSDmfQ5btvmO_u_SNcySULW5y_xM7y0Cjh31lO6uhzd5IR1LXaUCBwG1Zr"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30685" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> is a very crucial verse. “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion....” Notice two significant words here—image and dominion. Yes, man was created by God, and he fell. But we must consider in what way and for what purpose man was created. The Bible says that man was made in the image of God. Nothing is higher than God. Thus, man was made in the image of the highest One. Perhaps you have never regarded yourself this highly before. Because we bear the divine image, we should have a high regard for ourselves. We are not low creatures; we were made for the purpose of expressing God and exercising His dominion. The subject of Genesis is man bearing the image of God and exercising God’s dominion over all things. We bear God’s image that we might express Him, and we have God’s dominion that we might represent Him. Therefore, we are God’s expression and representation. This is the heart of Genesis. </p>
<p data-content-id="0JV8hDILxxkbeRl9MfljI6tzqz_FVL0iYCHdxKUekJ14F8oFrW_U5yl_qzhcrk_AB"> In order to know this in a progressive way, we need all fifty chapters of this book. All the generations recorded in it—Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph—are for one purpose: to show that God’s economy in the universe is to express Himself through man. This is God’s purpose, God’s goal, and the desire of God’s heart. God’s purpose and economy are related to man. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROmJD9TljeOlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX"> The record of all the generations included in this book is a portrait of God’s divine economy. In Adam we do not see much of God’s expression and dominion. Although Abel believed in God, we do not clearly see in him God’s expression and dominion. Enosh realized that he was fragile and weak, and he began to call on the name of the Lord. But in him we scarcely see God’s expression or dominion. Enoch walked with God. Therefore, we see in him a little of God’s expression; however, we see nothing of God’s dominion. Although with Noah we do see a little of God’s expression and dominion, it is rather vague; it is not definite, impressive, or clear. In Abraham we <span class="pg" data-page-id="1181" id="1181">[1181]</span> see less of God’s expression and dominion than we do in Noah. Although many Christians have overly exalted Abraham, he was only on the first level of the doctrine of Christ. Abraham was the father of faith for justification, which is merely the beginning of the doctrine of Christ. Furthermore, we can hardly see God’s expression and dominion in Isaac. Isaac, the one who inherited everything from his father, only cared for eating. As long as he was given something good to eat, he would grant his blessing blindly. </p>
<p data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9BlbFhLAG6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr"> It is in Jacob that we see the expression of God. However, prior to the last fourteen chapters of this book, we do not see much of God’s expression in Jacob. But in these last chapters we do see in him very much of the expression of God and the dominion of God. Although in this section Jacob was old in years, his spiritual eyes were very keen. Wherever he went, he perceived the real situation and blessed people accordingly. Moreover, his blessing became God’s prophecy. Jacob truly bore the image of God and expressed Him. Even Pharaoh, the highest ruler at that time, was under Jacob’s blessing. When Jacob was brought into the presence of Pharaoh, Jacob did not say, “Hello, how are you? How old are you?” Rather, he stretched forth his hand and blessed him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30686" data-verses="Genesis 47:7">47:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30687" data-verses="Genesis 47:10">10</span>). This indicates that Pharaoh was under Jacob, the one who was God’s expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="FyrUURSenH7AUUlr0ndgcscIHmHevlth22OadvBKOnc_QUvWSaFJlMIPAfMT2Bdu2"> Jacob’s blessing upon the two sons of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasseh, was also a prophecy. Isaac, cheated by Jacob, blessed him blindly. However, Jacob’s blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh was much different. Joseph brought his two sons to Jacob, expecting that Manasseh, the firstborn, would receive the birthright. But Jacob placed his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, the younger, “guiding his hands wittingly” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30688" data-verses="Genesis 48:14">48:14</span>). When Joseph attempted to move Jacob’s hand from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s, Jacob refused and said, “I know it, my son, I know it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30689" data-verses="Genesis 48:19">48:19</span>). Jacob seemed to be saying, “My son, you don’t know what I am doing, but I know. I know God’s heart. My blessing is God’s expression and God’s speaking. The word of my blessing is God’s prophecy.” </p>
<p data-content-id="CAIiqFyjjgw0LbNxWLi5D_oX-w2icXq_WajUO0fMiI1qsIetqtq6bkTvknnO7bFYb"> Here in Jacob we see a man who was one with God and who expressed God. Jacob’s speaking was God’s speaking. Do not think that speaking is an insignificant matter. According <span class="pg" data-page-id="1182" id="1182">[1182]</span> to the New Testament, the Son expressed the Father mainly by His speaking. The Lord Jesus said, “Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works”; and, “The word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father’s who sent Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30690" data-verses="John 14:10">John 14:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30691" data-verses="John 14:24">24</span>). Thus, to express God is mainly to speak for God and to speak Him forth to others. </p>
<p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KabjpnRfDe1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> We have seen that Jacob, God’s expression, bore the image of God. But what about God’s dominion? The book of Genesis ends with Joseph exercising dominion over the whole earth. Although Pharaoh was the king, he was merely a figurehead. The acting king was Joseph, who is a part of Jacob in the experience of life. In Jacob with Joseph we see the expression of God with the dominion of God. Never separate Joseph from Jacob. The record of the last fourteen chapters of Genesis mixes the two together. This indicates that Joseph is the reigning part of Jacob and that Jacob and Joseph should not be considered as separate persons. </p>
<p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q_QAc1Da1gjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> In this section Jacob was suffering, and Joseph was reigning. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30692" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span> Joseph gave no impression that he was suffering. This chapter reveals that Jacob, not Joseph, was suffering. Some may argue and say, “When Joseph was cast into the pit, was he not suffering?” This is your interpretation, but this chapter does not tell us this. Jacob, on the contrary, suffered greatly. Although he did not weep at the death of Rachel, he wept sorrowfully when he concluded that Joseph had been devoured by a wild beast (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30693" data-verses="Genesis 37:33-35">vv. 33-35</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQeyRHqsfFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B"> Before we consider further Jacob’s dealings at Hebron, we need to point out the difference between transformation and maturity. The last stage of transformation is maturity. Maturity means the fullness of life. When one is mature, he has no shortage of life. The more life we have, the more mature we are. An infant is obviously not mature, but a grown man is mature. For a human being to be mature means that his life has come into fullness. </p>
<p data-content-id="QMSNPOcCBLw6v-EOydvwYHF5IucTduX4YH5_O01lRUzkJdbjHu_x8PZ2HwO74uIjb"> Transformation is a metabolic change in life. Thus, transformation is not a matter of fullness; it is a matter of change. Plants do not require transformation, because they are simply plants. But we, the children of God, need transformation. Only through transformation can we reach maturity. We have a natural life, but this life is not good for God’s economy. Although our natural life does not need to be replaced, it does need to be metabolically changed. We must not only have an outward change in appearance, but also an inward change in nature. Although our human life is necessary for God’s economy, it should not remain a natural human life; it should be a human life that has been transformed in nature so that the divine life may be mingled with the transformed human life to become one. This is a deep matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7Wk7aekT93ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo"> At least two verses in the New Testament unveil the matter of transformation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30728" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Romans 12:2</span> says, “Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.” The Greek word translated “transformed” in this verse also appears in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30729" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>. According to the Greek, this verse should be rendered, “And we all with unveiled face, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1192" id="1192">[1192]</span> beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.” The word “transformed” in these verses indicates that in our Christian life we need a metabolic change. We do not need outward correction and alteration; rather, we need an inward change in nature and in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKQjyYn10XCaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI"> This metabolic change begins with regeneration. When we were saved, we were not only justified and our sins forgiven; we were also regenerated. At regeneration a new life, the divine life, was put into our spirit. From the time of our regeneration, this life has been transforming our natural life. As the divine life changes our natural life, it imparts more and more of the divine life into our being. Therefore, transformation is the change of our natural life. When this change reaches the point of fullness, the time of maturity has come. To repeat, the last stage of transformation is maturity. Maturity is not a matter of our being changed; it is a matter of having the divine life imparted to us again and again until we have the fullness of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCnA3483WjEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB"> Let us now apply this matter to Jacob. Although Jacob underwent many changes between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30730" data-verses="Genesis 25:1">chapters twenty-five</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30731" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">thirty-seven</span>, we do not see any further change in him after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30732" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30733" data-verses="Genesis 25:1">chapter twenty-five</span> Jacob was a supplanter, a heel-holder. As we read from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30734" data-verses="Genesis 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30735" data-verses="Genesis 36:1">chapter thirty-six</span>, which covers a period of approximately twenty-five years, we see how Jacob changed. Everything that happened to him during these years was for his transformation. When in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30736" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span> Jacob lost his beloved son, Joseph, he was absolutely different from the person he was in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30737" data-verses="Genesis 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span>. In a spiritual sense, the Jacob in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30738" data-verses="Genesis 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> had several hands to use in grasping whatever he wanted. He grasped what belonged to his father, to Esau, and, later on, to Laban. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30739" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span> Jacob did not even use his own two hands. The Jacob in this chapter seems to have no skill or ability; instead, it seems that he is not able to do anything. This indicates that he has absolutely changed. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30740" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span> until the end of this book, we do not see any further change in this man. In <span class="pg" data-page-id="1193" id="1193">[1193]</span> these chapters we see a person who has not only been changed; we see a person who is full of life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30741" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span> we see neither change nor the fullness of life. The change took place before this chapter, and the fullness of life was reached after it. </p>
<p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQbrE9rmRUHTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> I would ask you to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30742" data-verses="Genesis 27:1">chapters twenty-seven</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30743" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">thirty-seven</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30744" data-verses="Genesis 47:1">chapter forty-seven</span> once again. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30745" data-verses="Genesis 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> we see a supplanter. He had many hands, he was able to do everything, and no one could defeat him. Whoever came in contact with Jacob—his father, his brother, or his uncle—was the loser. Jacob, on the contrary, always came out ahead. He made a gain from his brother, from his father, and from his uncle. He even made a gain from Rachel, Leah, and their two maids. However, at the time of Rachel’s death, Jacob began to suffer loss. But even this loss produced a gain, and that gain was Benjamin. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30746" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span> Jacob underwent another loss, the loss of Joseph. In this chapter Jacob did not gain anything. From this point onward, Jacob lost one thing after another. Eventually, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30747" data-verses="Genesis 47:1">chapter forty-seven</span>, he gained the fullness of life. The fullness of life is blessing, which is the overflow of life. When you are filled past the brim with life, this life will overflow into others. This overflow is the blessing. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30748" data-verses="Genesis 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> we see a supplanter; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30749" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span>, a transformed man; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30750" data-verses="Genesis 47:1">chapter forty-seven</span>, a mature person. Jacob’s transformation began at the time God came in to touch him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30751" data-verses="Genesis 32:25">32:25</span>), and it continued until <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30752" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span>, when the process of transformation was relatively complete. However, in this chapter Jacob did not yet have maturity, the fullness of life. In order to gain this, he had to experience the dealings in the last stage, the dealings at Hebron. </p>
<p data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYgy5UseQW5oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa"> Now we must consider how Jacob, a transformed person, could be filled with life. Human beings are vessels. However, unlike jars and bottles, we are not vessels without feeling, sense, or will. If you want to fill a bottle with a certain liquid, the bottle has no opinion or feeling about it. There is no need to have the consent of the bottle before we fill it. But it is difficult to put something in us living vessels because we are filled with opinions, desires, and intentions. Parents know <span class="pg" data-page-id="1194" id="1194">[1194]</span> how difficult it is to put medicine into their children. Likewise, it is not an easy matter for God to put His life into us. </p>
<p data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0ZJDZYoSconn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF"> Now I want to point out a hidden matter in this book. Jacob’s first dealing in the last stage was the loss of Joseph. Joseph was seventeen years old when he was sold (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30753" data-verses="Genesis 37:2">37:2</span>), and he was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30754" data-verses="Genesis 41:46">41:46</span>). Following this, there were the seven plenteous years. It was probably one or two years later that Jacob sent his sons to Egypt to buy grain. Therefore, from the selling of Joseph to the sending of Jacob’s sons to Egypt was a period of at least twenty years. The Bible does not afford us any record of what Jacob did during these years. It only gives us an account of what Joseph experienced. As far as the record of Jacob is concerned, this period of twenty years was a time of silence. </p>
<p data-content-id="YWQf39oOaKT-w18LKhlsjr9Mn8kIDjHh52RJBmzJk0PH2LSkAzFUEZelzC01-ioTH"> What do you think Jacob was doing during this time? If you had been Jacob, what would you have done? I have considered this matter very much, and I think I have discovered something. During these years Jacob had nothing to do. He had no lack and he had no ambition. Jacob had cared only for Rachel, not for Leah and the two maids. After Rachel died, Jacob’s heart was set on Joseph, who was taken away from him about a year later. After Joseph was taken away, Jacob had virtually nothing left. Therefore, during these silent years he was a person without any ambitions, interests, or things to do. This must have been the time God imparted Himself into Jacob more and more. How different were these twenty years from the twenty years with Laban! During the twenty years with Laban (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30755" data-verses="Genesis 31:41">31:41</span>), Jacob had struggled against Laban and had been concerned about dealing with Rachel, Leah, the maids, and all his children. But in these twenty years at Hebron Jacob was released from any bondage or occupation. He was not only retired—he was free. </p>

Transformation is the metabolic change in life, and maturity is the fullness in life. Maturity is the last stage of transformation. As we are being transformed, we are also being filled with life. The more we are transformed, the more we are filled with life. No one can be filled with life without being transformed. The degree of the filling is in proportion to the degree of transformation.

According to the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30783" data-verses="Genesis 25:1">chapter twenty-five</span>, Jacob began supplanting even before he was born. Jacob’s transformation began from the time God touched him. This took place in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30784" data-verses="Genesis 32:1">chapter thirty-two</span>. Although in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30785" data-verses="Genesis 25:1">chapters twenty-five</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30786" data-verses="Genesis 32:1">thirty-two</span> there is no transformation, no change in life, these chapters are full of dealings. Remember, Jacob spent twenty years under the hand of Laban. During those years he suffered one dealing after another. After those twenty years of dealings, one night, at Peniel, the Lord came and touched Jacob’s strongest part, his thigh, and Jacob became lame. That marked the beginning of Jacob’s transformation, and the process of transformation continued from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30787" data-verses="Genesis 32:1">chapter thirty-two</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30788" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span>. In these chapters we see a picture of how Jacob was being transformed. However, after the time Jacob lost Joseph in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30789" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span>, we see no further change in Jacob’s life. The reason for this is that at that time his transformation was <span class="pg" data-page-id="1204" id="1204">[1204]</span> nearly completed. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30790" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span> Jacob’s maturity began. </p>
<p data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv2wyeOZUhY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df"> There are three distinct periods in Jacob’s life: the period of dealings, the period of transformation, and the period of maturity.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30794" data-verses="Genesis 47:1">chapter forty-seven</span> Jacob’s maturity reaches its peak and it is fully manifested.

<p data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3OhmfX2ZIDDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12"> The first sign of Jacob’s maturity is the fact that he did not blame his sons when he heard the news about Joseph’s being alive in Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30795" data-verses="Genesis 45:21-28">45:21-28</span>). Although they had conspired to kill Joseph, eventually sold him into slavery, and lied to their father about him, Jacob did not blame them. If he had not been mature, he would have said, “What have you done to me? Don’t you know that you nearly killed me?” But, according to the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30796" data-verses="Genesis 45:1">chapter forty-five</span>, Jacob did not blame anyone. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQK1r6fWFG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30797" data-verses="Genesis 45:26-27">Genesis 45:26 and 27</span> mention Jacob’s heart and his spirit. Although some so-called Christians think that the spirit and the heart are the same, we know by the true light of the Bible that the heart is the heart and that the spirit is the spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30798" data-verses="Genesis 45:26">Verse 26</span> says that “Jacob’s heart became numb” (Heb.), and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30799" data-verses="Genesis 45:27">verse 27</span> says that “the spirit of Jacob their father revived.” When Jacob heard the good news concerning Joseph, his heart became numb. Some versions say that his heart became cold. The Hebrew word means numb, having no feeling or sense. Although Jacob’s heart was numb, his spirit revived. </p>
<p data-content-id="uMdoZ7sIrphDxIxrKnqKndOdCN9KZxYYQWIgd4x9rSnaU9KtTeicgVo8QagD4QHNt"> We need to be like Jacob. In certain situations, our heart should be numb, and our spirit should be revived. Recently, many of the young people have been getting “drunk” with Christ. But I would ask them these questions: Is your heart numb? Have you been revived in your spirit or in your heart? I am not certain that they have been revived in the spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1205" id="1205">[1205]</span> Perhaps their excitement is a mixture of the spirit and the heart. This mixture indicates that there has been no division between soul and spirit. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30800" data-verses="Hebrews 4:12">Hebrews 4:12</span>, the spirit must be divided from the soul. A mature saint is one who is revived, living, and excited in spirit, but numb in heart. Although we should be hot in spirit, we should be cold in heart. Our spirit must be a stove full of blazing fire, but our heart must be a refrigerator. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnmUdwK6oLQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM"> When we are young in our spiritual life, we are revived mainly in heart, and we are numb in spirit. The younger you are, the more you are revived in heart and numb in spirit. But as you grow, you become somewhat numb in heart and revived in spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30801" data-verses="Genesis 45:1">chapter forty-five</span> we see that Jacob was a mature saint. Hence, the Bible says that his heart was numb, but that his spirit revived. This was a manifestation of his maturity. Such a saying about the heart and the spirit can be found only in the Bible, not in any secular writings. </p>
<p data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-ytt2P2AKBVlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo"> Because Jacob’s heart became numb and because his spirit was revived, he did not blame anyone or anything. In his heart there was no feeling, sense, or reaction. His soul life was completely deadened, and his heart was like wood. Because Jacob’s soul and spirit had been divided, the good news concerning Joseph issued in the reviving of his spirit, not in the stirring up of his heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXQ2zJfoce443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> Do not think that I intend to cool down the excitement of the young people. No, the young people must be excited. Children are children, fathers are fathers, and grandfathers are grandfathers. How childish for a grandfather to be easily excited! It is the children who should be excited. If they are not, they may be physically or mentally ill. Healthy children are always easily excited. </p>
<p data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkw9RCeNT-oPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU"> When I returned from a recent trip to Europe, I brought back some souvenirs for two of my grandchildren. To the one, a boy of seven years of age, I gave a nutcracker, and to the other, a boy less than four years of age, I gave a little toy car. These boys were so excited that they could hardly eat, sleep, or stand still. The older boy even brought his nutcracker to school to show his teacher and classmates. We were very happy to see the excitement of our grandsons, for it was an <span class="pg" data-page-id="1206" id="1206">[1206]</span> indication that they are living and healthy. However, suppose I gave such a gift to one of the elders and, in his excitement, he showed it to the other elders. If he did this, I would doubt that he was the proper brother to be an elder. It is wrong for an older person to be excited like this. The young people, on the contrary, are young people, and they need to be excited. </p>
<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6NqBabif9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> Because Jacob was not excited, he did not blame others regarding the loss of Joseph. No one can learn this merely by being taught. Teaching about it simply does not work. If I teach my seven-year-old grandson not to blame his brother, it will be of no avail. As soon as I turn my back, he will blame his younger brother. Because he is at the blaming age and has a blaming life, he cannot keep from blaming others. Of course, this does not mean that we should not train our children. We must discipline them. But learning not to blame others depends on the growth of life, not upon outward teachings. </p>
<p data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjKtcH8TJcGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30802" data-verses="Genesis 45:1">Genesis chapter forty-five</span> we see a saint who did not pretend, perform, or act. Because he had come into maturity, his heart was numb, and he did not blame others. Some may think that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30803" data-verses="Genesis 25:26">verse 26</span> indicates that Jacob’s heart was shocked at the good news and that it became numb because of the shock. I do not believe this. When a young person receives some shocking news, his mind, emotion, and will continue to be active. They are not numb in the least. I have seen some who were severely shocked, yet their soul was very active. But when Jacob, an old man, received the good news about Joseph, he had no reaction: his heart was numb. This is a sign of Jacob’s maturity in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qfWJIx_FdzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> Young people, do not try to imitate this maturity. There is no need to perform. You are young people, not fathers or grandfathers. Therefore, do not try to behave like a grandfather. Do not act as if you were numb in heart and revived in spirit. I appreciate it when my grandchildren are excited, for that behavior is genuine, natural, and spontaneous. It is not a performance. The young people should not be troubled by this message on the manifestation of maturity. I say again, the young need to be excited. If a young person is not excited, he is not normal. Do not pretend to be more mature than you are. Pretending only kills. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1207" id="1207">[1207]</span> </p>

Nearly every item in this book is a seed developed in the following books of the Bible. This is true also with the matter of blessing. In this message, another parenthesis in our life-study, we shall consider the seed of blessing sown in Genesis and its development in the Old Testament and the New Testament. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWKhrBFs2tXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS">I. THE PRINCIPLE OF BLESSING</h2><p data-content-id="MtCll2XOY8R8dFgTUXdR4YNY7Wc78JwNRjNJM9TIVoQfsRCA1WYTsZI35lh9oQ1PX"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30817" data-verses="Hebrews 7:7">Hebrews 7:7</span> says, “But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.” In this verse we see the principle of blessing: that the greater blesses the lesser. To be greater or lesser is not mainly a matter of age. It is a matter of the measure of Christ. We are greater or lesser according to our measure of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30818" data-verses="Matthew 11:11">Matthew 11:11</span> the Lord Jesus said, “Truly I say to you, Among those born of women, there has not arisen a greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is smallest in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.” Here the Lord Jesus says that John the Baptist was greater than all who had preceded him. However, the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John. The reason John was greater than his predecessors was that he was very close to Christ. Although Abraham was great, he did not see Christ. However, John the Baptist saw Him. But, although John was so close to Christ, he did not have Christ in him. Those in the kingdom of heaven are not only close to Christ; they have Christ within them. For this reason the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John. The great ones in the Old Testament could say that Christ was coming, and John the Baptist could say that Christ was in front of him. But all of us <span class="pg" data-page-id="1214" id="1214">[1214]</span> in the kingdom of heaven can say that Christ is within us. We can even say, “For to me to live is Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30819" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Phil. 1:21</span>). Hence, we are closer to Christ than John the Baptist and all who went before him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Vyv6cezndY8yrw_ApV0zPcU-7Ef2JbjcYWxSSt0SaXZR8SPfWLyu4As---ucS3eoN"> Whether we are greater or lesser depends upon our measure of Christ. If you have more of Christ, you are greater. If you have less of Christ, you are lesser. If by having more of Christ we are greater than others, then we are qualified to bless them; for the greater always blesses the lesser. The reason for this is that the greater one has a larger measure of Christ to give to others. If you are greater than I, it means that you have a greater portion of Christ than I. If so, then you have something more of Christ to minister to me. To bless others means to minister Christ to them. Those who have just a small measure of Christ need the blessing of those who have a greater measure. We bless them with the very Christ in whom we participate and whom we enjoy. If we enjoy Christ more, then we have more of Christ to minister to others. This ministering of Christ is blessing. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8Afonztge3euPeQc1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq">II. THE MEANING OF BLESSING</h2><p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6tGb5mJJWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> It is rather difficult to give a proper definition of blessing. Years ago I could only say the blessing was asking or wishing something good for others. But after years of experience I can say that blessing is the overflow of God through someone’s maturity in life. God cannot flow Himself into others without a human channel. If Christ had never been incarnated, God would not have been able to flow to man, because there would not have been a channel. God’s flowing needs humanity as a channel. The only humanity God can use as the channel is one saturated and permeated with God. For this reason Jacob did not bless anyone until he had become mature. Jacob did not bless Laban or Esau. Even when he saw his brother Esau after the twenty years with Laban, he did not bless him. It was not until he went down into Egypt that he blessed Pharaoh, the highest ruler on earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30820" data-verses="Genesis 47:7">47:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30821" data-verses="Genesis 47:10">10</span>). At that time Jacob was filled with God. Through Jacob’s blessing of Pharaoh God’s blessing overflowed to Pharaoh. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1215" id="1215">[1215]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="e4Tu7RSEEn956Bu43KIdFu9FenExLhbqE99G8qhMhliWdoAMPEcx2IgxrawDytCgr"> A child two years of age cannot bless anyone; however, a child of seven or eight may perform some kind of blessing. This illustrates the fact that blessing others depends upon maturity in life. Maturity in life is a matter of being filled with God. When you are full of God, you have the overflow of God, and thus you are able to bless everyone you meet. Years ago I could not say such a word about blessing. This understanding of blessing does not come from reading books; it comes only from experience. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_LXfeUOBYw3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj">III. THE FIRST CASE OF BLESSING</h2><p data-content-id="NgrUOPst9ndCGqPDKS1sPE8m5DPRKLEkyN_8bfWBSPyO-5g1-dnym0-8I86wUsKBc"> The first case of blessing in the Bible is Melchisedec’s blessing of Abraham (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30822" data-verses="Genesis 14:18-20">14:18-20</span>). Melchisedec was a type of Christ. Therefore, Melchisedec’s coming to Abraham was Christ’s coming to him. Melchisedec came to Abraham with bread and wine, just as the Lord also comes to us with bread and wine. Furthermore, Melchisedec came as the eternal priest, and Christ became a priest according to the eternal order of Melchisedec (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30823" data-verses="Hebrews 5:6">Heb. 5:6</span>). A priest brings people to God. If you would bless others, you must be God’s priest. Later we shall see that in the Old Testament God commanded the priests to bless His people. Blessing is the overflow of God, and this overflow is brought to people through the priests. The first blessing was bestowed by a priest. We all need to be priests, those who bring people to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="topU0NZPOs7b25ters3Gd7WJK2iJhSqSpV5hz_XoXr_MU93J_kJdBBom0evJv9lGi"> If we would bless others, we must be close to God ourselves. We must be priests who bring others to God. People need God’s blessing because they are far away from Him. A priest eliminates the distance between God and the people; he brings those who are far off into the presence of God. On the shoulders of the high priest were two onyx stones engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and on his breastplate there were twelve stones, also engraved with the names of the twelve tribes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30824" data-verses="Exodus 28:9-12">Exo. 28:9-12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30825" data-verses="Exodus 28:15-21">15-21</span>). Whenever the high priest entered into the Holy of Holies, he wore the breastplate and the shoulder plates. This indicated that he brought the people of Israel into the presence of God. We all realize that a priest serves God, but we may never have seen that he also eliminates the distance between the people <span class="pg" data-page-id="1216" id="1216">[1216]</span> and God. Before you are blessed by a priest, there may be a distance between you and God. But after he blesses you, this distance is taken away, and you are brought into the presence of God to share in the enjoyment of God. When Melchisedec blessed Abraham, that blessing brought him into the presence of God. Melchisedec even said, “Blessed be Abram of the most high God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30826" data-verses="Genesis 14:19">14:19</span>). If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30827" data-verses="Genesis 14:1">Genesis 14</span> carefully, you will see that Melchisedec blessed Abraham with nothing other than God. He did not say, “Be blessed with a good house”; neither did he say, “Be blessed with two sons.” Instead, he said, “Be blessed of the most high God.” In this way, Melchisedec brought Abraham much closer to God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="h08U91ltZnqTUI0aV0g56li2iI86Cw-cZTKHrVo12qTwS3OgmpjHqkUk9BKO83GId">IV. THE BLESSING OF THE PRIESTS</h2><p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UWKhrBEoKtXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30828" data-verses="Numbers 6:23-27">Numbers 6:23-27</span> we see a pattern of blessing. Here God commanded the priests to bless the people by saying to them, “The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.” The blessing here is not onefold or twofold; it is threefold. The blessing is threefold because it is a matter of the dispensing of God into man. This involves the Trinity: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Trinity is not a matter of doctrine; it is a matter of God’s dispensing Himself into His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="MtCll2XOY8R8dFgTUXdR4YNY7XoL8JwNRjNJM9TIVoQfsRCA1WYTsZI35lh9oQ1PX"> The first aspect of the blessing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30829" data-verses="Numbers 6:1">Numbers 6</span> is related to God the Father’s blessing and keeping power. The second aspect is related to the shining face of God the Son and His grace. The word “gracious” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30830" data-verses="Numbers 6:25">Numbers 6:25</span> means more in Hebrew than the English word gracious conveys. The Hebrew meaning is to stoop in kindness to those who are inferior. This indicates that by becoming a man the second of the Trinity stooped in kindness to us, the inferior ones. When He became man, He surely stooped down from the heavens. This is grace. </p>

In this message, a parenthesis in our life-study, we shall consider another one of these seeds—the seed of the shifting of the birthright. </p>
<p data-content-id="R_GfdTPWaEiXNNW82-yDaVVjDgqGLG6UWYb4K416h7Rart6vExDqqOyU38XwPBejO"> Perhaps you have never imagined that the birthright could be shifted. The birthright is the special portion of the firstborn. In nearly every race of people, especially in ancient times, the firstborn in a family inherited a special portion. Among the ancient Jews, this portion was usually a double portion of the land. According to the Bible as a whole, the birthright includes the double portion of the land, the kingship, and the priesthood. The priesthood brings people to God, and the kingship brings God to the people. The book of Genesis reveals that this birthright can be shifted from the firstborn son to the second son. In this book there are at least four cases of the shifting of the birthright: from Esau to Jacob (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30852" data-verses="Genesis 25:22-26">25:22-26</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30853" data-verses="Genesis 25:29-34">29-34</span>); from Zarah to Pharez (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30854" data-verses="Genesis 38:27-30">38:27-30</span>); from Reuben to Joseph (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30855" data-verses="Genesis 49:3-4">49:3-4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30856" data-verses="1Chronicles 5:1">1 Chron. 5:1</span>); and from Manasseh to Ephraim (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30857" data-verses="Genesis 48:12-20">48:12-20</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="sHB9QAVlSM3v0XjManno-kQkrnz_fHA5fTkqfQSTHo75EQs1z1Iu7LXCJgPqSPnNs"> Furthermore, in the New Testament the birthright is shifted from Israel to the church. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30858" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke chapter fifteen</span> the Lord Jesus indicates by means of the parable of the prodigal son that the publicans and sinners are like the second son, and that the self-righteous Pharisees are like the first son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30859" data-verses="Luke 15:1-2">Luke 15:1-2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30860" data-verses="Luke 15:11">11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30861" data-verses="Luke 15:25-28">25-28</span>). However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30862" data-verses="Matthew 21:28-32">Matthew 21:28-32</span> the Lord shifts the birthright from the Jews to the publicans and harlots. Here the Lord reveals that the publicans and harlots are like the firstborn son who at first did not obey his father’s word but later repented and obeyed it. Then the Lord likened the Pharisees to the second son who said that he would fulfill <span class="pg" data-page-id="1224" id="1224">[1224]</span> his father’s word, but who actually did not obey it. Originally, the Jews were the first son. At the beginning of the Lord’s ministry, they were still first. But at the end of His ministry, the Lord Jesus shifted the birthright from the Jews to the church. His word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30863" data-verses="Matthew 21:28-32">Matthew 21:28-32</span> was spoken at the end of His ministry. In these verses the Lord likened the publicans and the harlots to the firstborn. The church is composed of redeemed and regenerated sinners. In God’s economy they are the ones who have received the birthright. Hence, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30864" data-verses="Hebrews 12:23">Hebrews 12:23</span> speaks of the church of the firstborn. </p>

FROM ESAU TO JACOB</h2><p data-content-id="LD01-v3um3NuLShGttlViomKnUvsRg9jsTHcyuTXlEDKbBHncuqREEkOSwGaFv9xn"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30865" data-verses="Genesis 25:22-26">25:22-26</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30866" data-verses="Genesis 25:29-34">29-34</span> we see the shifting of the birthright from Esau to Jacob. Although Esau was the firstborn (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30867" data-verses="Genesis 25:25">v. 25</span>), Jacob was predestinated to have the birthright (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30868" data-verses="Genesis 25:23">v. 23</span>). The shifting of the birthright from Esau to Jacob reveals that receiving the birthright is a matter of predestination. It does not depend on our natural birth. Although you may be an Esau by birth, this does not mean that you are predestinated to have the birthright. This is absolutely a matter of God’s sovereignty; it does not depend on us. As we consider the five cases of the shifting of the birthright, we must worship God for His sovereignty and say, “O Lord, we thank You for Your sovereignty. Everything depends on Your sovereign predestination.” </p>
<p data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD0VuB0APfiWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP"> Jacob, the one predestinated to have the birthright, was very covetous and did everything possible to get the birthright himself. When Jacob and Esau were still in their mother’s womb, they were fighting over the birthright. I believe that this fight was initiated by Jacob. But, according to God’s arrangement, Esau was stronger. If you read the Bible carefully, you will see that Esau, as a hunter, was strong and rather large in physical stature. Jacob, on the contrary, as one who stayed home with his mother, must have been rather small. I do not believe that a husky young man would always stay home with his mother. Because Jacob was smaller and weaker than Esau, he could not obtain the birthright by fighting for it with his physical strength. Although Jacob fought for the birthright in the womb, Esau defeated him, was <span class="pg" data-page-id="1225" id="1225">[1225]</span> born first, and gained the birthright. Jacob’s struggle had been in vain. </p>
<p data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjKtUH8TpcGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD"> Jacob, however, refused to give up the fight. I believe he stayed with his mother mainly for the purpose of conspiring with her to gain the birthright. Perhaps Jacob’s mother eventually agreed to help him gain the birthright. In order to supplant his brother and gain the birthright, Jacob did two things. The first was to maneuver Esau into a situation where he was willing to sell the birthright to him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30869" data-verses="Genesis 25:29-34">vv. 29-34</span>). Jacob was exceedingly subtle and clever. He was very skillful. Through his cleverness he gained his mother’s cooperation, and Rebekah, who was more clever than Isaac, stood with Jacob. This clever Jacob tempted Esau to sell his birthright. </p>
<p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qfWBIx_ldzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> Jacob probably observed Esau’s activities over a period of time. He might have noticed that after hunting Esau was always hungry. Because hunting arouses one’s appetite, a hunter enjoys a good meal after a hunt. Anyone who engages in exhausting activity, such as hard work or play, afterwards desires some hearty and nourishing food. Jacob analyzed the entire situation—the environment, Esau’s psychology, and Esau’s appetite after hunting. Jacob might have said to himself, “Aha! I have a way to get the birthright. While Esau is hunting, I shall prepare soup for him.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30870" data-verses="Genesis 25:29">Genesis 25:29</span> says, “And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint.” Esau was hungry, and the soup had been prepared. Esau said to Jacob, “Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30871" data-verses="Genesis 25:30">v. 30</span>). To this, Jacob replied, “Sell me this day thy birthright” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30872" data-verses="Genesis 25:31">v. 31</span>). When a person is hungry, he will eat anything and pay any price for it. Thus, Esau said, “Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30873" data-verses="Genesis 25:32">v. 32</span>). Esau seemed to be saying, “The birthright is something for the future. What good does it do me now? But here is a bowl of soup in front of me. It is actual, present, and practical. Who knows when I shall have the birthright? I don’t know when it will come. For now, I need something real and practical.” Hence, Esau agreed to Jacob’s proposal and sold his birthright. On the one hand, the birthright depends on God’s sovereign predestination. But on the other hand, whether or not we shall have the birthright <span class="pg" data-page-id="1226" id="1226">[1226]</span> depends on our attitude and our deeds. Esau’s attitude was poor, and his act was foolish. He was absolutely wrong to accept Jacob’s offer. Nevertheless, using today’s terms, he signed the contract and gave up his birthright. </p>
<p data-content-id="aGZQhn44RfDLbiYsGGvVEQYwVrunKCGvuVmdAiPygWOGRgcCG0VL2WETay77K2O7o"> Although Esau had sold the birthright, he did not have the standing to give the blessing of the birthright. This blessing was not in his hand; it was in the hand of Isaac, his father, the representative of God. Therefore, the second thing Jacob did to gain the birthright was to deceive his father into giving him the blessing of the birthright (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30874" data-verses="Genesis 27:18-29">27:18-29</span>). Probably Jacob’s maneuvering of Esau was initiated by Rebekah who, in all likelihood, had been maneuvering the whole situation. Jacob was the learner, and his mother was the tutor. After Esau had been maneuvered into selling the birthright to Jacob, Rebekah waited for the opportune time to help Jacob receive the blessing of the birthright from Isaac. Although this had to take place before Isaac died, it could not be too early. If it had been too early, Isaac’s eyesight would still have been keen. Hence, Rebekah waited until Isaac’s eyes were dim. When she heard that Isaac was about to bless Esau, Rebekah said to Jacob, “Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30875" data-verses="Genesis 27:8">27:8</span>). Rebekah seemed to be saying, “Now is the time to deceive your father.” Jacob obeyed his mother and deceived Isaac into blessing him blindly. As a result, Jacob obtained not only the birthright, but also the blessing of the birthright. </p>
<p data-content-id="bdPZiOYGTI0GDMWc0r7m5T_8NGe9CY4FzwTm0_1hM378LkILri-YBA6MHtvxUHmDQ"> Jacob’s maneuvering, however, was unnecessary. If he had done no maneuvering or deceiving, God would have had a way to give him the birthright. Apparently, Jacob’s maneuvering and deceiving helped him to acquire the birthright. Actually, it caused him to suffer. From the time Jacob deceived his father, he never saw his mother again. Although Rebekah loved Jacob, due to her cleverness she lost him and never saw him again. Jacob had to flee to Laban’s home and suffer there under his hand for twenty years. Do not learn of Rebekah. If you do, you will suffer. </p>

Although we are familiar with what it means to prophesy, we may not be familiar with prophesying with blessing. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30901" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> is the only chapter that reveals this matter. Although Moses’ blessing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30902" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:1">Deuteronomy 33</span> is close to what is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30903" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span>, the blessing there is not as rich as the blessing here. Both portions of the Word are prophecies concerning Israel, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30904" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> there is a richer blessing than in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30905" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:1">Deuteronomy 33</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="vGPkFtfe7Aen3iGIVhF4Dem7r5hhJoSKHjShQRi-Q6TFheMiOa11sXw6WrcmFYS61"> The prophesying in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30906" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span> is a manifestation of maturity, for our speaking always reveals where we are and how mature we are. A baby cannot speak at all, but a child over a year old may begin to say a few words. His speaking reveals that he is a small child. It is the same with other age groups: a young man speaks like a young man, a middle-aged person like a middle-aged person, and a grandfather like a grandfather. Hence, our speaking not only represents our age, but also the kind of person we are. If you are quick, you will not speak slowly. If you are slow, you will not speak quickly. If you are a high person, you will not speak in a low way, and if you are a low person, you will not speak on a high level. Thus, our speaking reveals what we are and where we are. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1232" id="1232">[1232]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3Ohmfb2bcrDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12"> It has been said that the wisest thing to do is not to speak at all. If I stood before a group of people without saying anything, they would not know whether I was deep or shallow, quick or slow. I would be a mystery. However, during the past fourteen years, every fiber of my being has been revealed to you all through my speaking. Even children seven or eight years old know me rather well because they have listened to my speaking. Because I speak so much, I am not able to conceal myself. The best way to conceal yourself is not to speak. During my early years in the ministry, I was quite wise, for I never said anything in the conferences of the co-workers. Because that was my policy, I was a mystery to the other co-workers, and no one could understand me. Although it is difficult to speak, it is more difficult not to speak. When the opportunity presents itself, you simply will not be able to refrain from speaking. I doubt if you could stay with me for sixty minutes and not say a word. I am certain that after a few minutes you would be speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PQK1n6dSpG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> Now let us briefly trace the matter of Jacob’s speaking as it is revealed in Genesis. The first record of his speaking is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30907" data-verses="Genesis 25:31">25:31</span>, where Jacob said to Esau, “Sell me this day thy birthright.” Gaining the birthright was the desire of Jacob’s heart; it was his dream and aspiration. For a long time he had been waiting for the opportunity to get it away from Esau. When the opportunity finally came, the first word out of Jacob’s mouth recorded in Scripture was the word about selling the birthright. </p>
<p data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8Afonztge3WuNK4c1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30908" data-verses="Genesis 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> Jacob spoke in a deceitful way to Isaac, his father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30909" data-verses="Genesis 27:19-20">vv. 19-20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30910" data-verses="Genesis 27:23">23</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30911" data-verses="Genesis 27:19">27:19</span> Jacob lied to his father, saying, “I am Esau thy firstborn.” When Isaac asked how he had found the venison so quickly, Jacob said, “Because the Lord thy God brought it to me.” Then Isaac said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30912" data-verses="Genesis 27:22">v. 22</span>), and he asked, “Art thou my very son Esau?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30913" data-verses="Genesis 27:24">v. 24</span>). To this, Jacob replied, “I am.” Thus, Jacob’s speaking in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30914" data-verses="Genesis 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> was absolute falsehood. </p>
<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi6tGT5kNlWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> Jacob’s speaking in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30915" data-verses="Genesis 29:1">chapters twenty-nine through thirty-two</span> is full of self-interest, self-ambition, and self-gain. Through his speaking recorded in these chapters many <span class="pg" data-page-id="1233" id="1233">[1233]</span> aspects of the self are exposed. Jacob’s speaking was so selfish that it almost seemed that he did not have a spirit. If we had a brother like that among us, we would doubt that he had been truly regenerated. </p>
<p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWjwt-4trAfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> Jacob’s speaking to his brother Esau in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30916" data-verses="Genesis 33:1">chapter thirty-three</span> was a performance. In this chapter Jacob several times addressed Esau as, “My lord” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30917" data-verses="Genesis 33:13-14">33:13-14</span>). Deep within, Jacob never recognized Esau as his lord. The reason he addressed his brother in this way was that he was afraid Esau would kill him. Jacob was an actor, a politician, and his display of humility before Esau was a performance. </p>
<p data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXkW_lgNWQwrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip"> By the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30918" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span>, however, Jacob’s speaking had undergone a change. His speaking in this chapter begins to resemble that of a regenerated person, a child of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LmaEyaAXyrZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> In the chapters that follow Jacob’s loss of Joseph, Jacob spoke very little. This indicates that, as we grow in life, our speaking will firstly change in nature. The characteristic of our speaking will change. Eventually, the amount of our speaking will be greatly reduced. The more we grow, the less we shall speak. At present you may not be able to withstand the temptation to speak. But after some years have gone by and you have had much more growth in life, you will not speak no matter how great the temptation is. </p>
<p data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtqKW4iLr__u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m"> We can trace Jacob’s progress in life by following his progress in speaking. The change in his speaking reveals his growth. Eventually, Jacob grew to the point that, even when he lost Joseph, he had very little to say. However, many of us have a great deal to say over such insignificant matters as losing a pair of socks. If a young brother in the brothers’ house loses a pair of socks, he may shout, “Where are my socks? What has happened to them?” But when Jacob lost Joseph, the treasure of his heart, he did not say very much. This was a healthy sign. But talking a great deal over a pair of socks is a sign of immaturity, a sign of childishness. Too much talking reveals that you are childish. In this we see that our speaking is a sign of how much we have grown. There are some among us who used to be quite talkative several years ago. But now they talk very little. I hope that after another <span class="pg" data-page-id="1234" id="1234">[1234]</span> period of time, they will hardly talk at all. The reason for their not talking will not be that they are unhappy; it will be the fact that they have grown in life. The more we grow, the less we talk. </p>
<p data-content-id="6CXs4WE0BL6-B1B4FDiAFpZQue3HzGKjTYJeRnGmeXBe72gXmUfpgBoC9qhDjO81n"> Consider Jacob’s reaction at hearing the news that Joseph was alive and in Egypt. He said very little; in fact, he said hardly anything at all. If we had been Jacob, we would either have been furious with the other sons, ready to beat them, or we would have been extremely excited, running from one son to another and saying, “Joseph is still living!” In either case, there would have been a great deal of talk. But Jacob said very little. Furthermore, he had little to say after he had gone down to Egypt. When Jacob was ushered into the presence of Pharaoh, he did not say anything. Rather, he simply blessed Pharaoh. There was nearly no talk, but there were strong blessings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30919" data-verses="Genesis 47:7">47:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30920" data-verses="Genesis 47:10">10</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="R_GfdTPWaEiXNNW82-yDaVVnDhuyLG6UWYb4K416h7Rart6vExDqqOyU38XwPBejO"> Because of his maturity, Jacob’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30921" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span> was very weighty. Every word he uttered here became a prophecy. Because this chapter is so deep, it is closed to many Christians. They have neither probed the depths of this chapter, nor do they know what it is talking about. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30922" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> we see a person who has fully matured. This man does not speak in a shallow, light, idle manner; he speaks in a way that is full of life and maturity. This indicates that our growth in life will be manifested in our speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="sHB9QAVlSM3v0XjManno-kQgrmH3fHA5fTkqfQSTHo75EQs1z1Iu7LXCJgPqSPnNs"> This message on prophesying with blessing is quite deep. It is not deep in doctrine; it is deep in experience. Although few among us have come to the level of this experience of life, this message is still needed as part of our life-study of Genesis. It will help us both in the growth of life and in the matter of speaking. Be impressed with the fact that your speaking reveals where you are. Whenever you are about to speak, you should say to yourself, “My speaking reveals me.” Realizing this will help us a great deal. </p>

<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j6Nqxaamr9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> In this message we shall continue with the subject of Jacob’s prophesying with blessing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30954" data-verses="Genesis 49:1-28">49:1-28</span>). In the previous message we pointed out that although this word of prophecy was spoken by a man, it was nonetheless the word of God. Because, in his maturity, Jacob was one with God, whatever he said was God’s word. Most Christians have a difficult time understanding <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30955" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span>. When I first began to study this chapter about fifty years ago, I found that it was not easy to learn the meaning of the prophecies recorded here. This is a very significant chapter, for it is virtually the conclusion of the book of Genesis. </p>
<p data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hjKtsH9nBcGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD"> According to the record of Genesis, the human race began with Adam and continued with Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Eventually, Jacob was no longer an individual, because he became the father of a house that was chosen by God. This house, the house of Jacob (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30956" data-verses="Genesis 46:27">46:27</span>), was composed mainly of Jacob’s twelve sons. Later, these twelve sons became the twelve tribes of the nation of Israel. This indicates that God’s intention is to have a house, not individuals. The house of Israel was a type of the church, which is God’s house today. In the Old Testament we have a house, the house of Israel, and in the New Testament we also have a house, the church of the living God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30957" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">1 Tim. 3:15</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1qfW5IwbJdzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> Whatever is spoken regarding the house of Israel is a type, a picture, and a shadow of the church. When I was with the Brethren teachers, they told us to differentiate those parts of the Bible that were for the children of Israel from those that were for the church. In a sense, this is correct, for we should <span class="pg" data-page-id="1244" id="1244">[1244]</span> not mix God’s word concerning the house of Israel with His word concerning the church. However, because the church is a spiritual entity, it is difficult for us to understand it. Thus, we need the picture of the house of Israel in the Old Testament. The principle is that the Bible uses types and figures to portray spiritual things. Anything that is spiritual is mysterious. For example, because New Jerusalem is spiritual and mysterious, the Bible uses a city to illustrate it. Likewise, without the picture of the house of Israel, we would find it difficult to adequately comprehend the church. However, when we examine the picture in the Old Testament, we are able to understand many aspects of the church revealed in the New Testament. Therefore, what is spoken concerning the children of Israel is not only for them; it is also for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="aGZQhn44RfDLbiYsGGvVEQYIVp6HKCGvuVmdAiPygWOGRgcCG0VL2WETay77K2O7o"> Based upon the principle of using types and pictures to portray spiritual realities, we must apply to ourselves all that is said about the twelve tribes of Israel. Physically speaking, of course, we are not the twelve tribes of Israel; however, spiritually speaking, we are the twelve tribes because they are pictures of us. If we want to know ourselves, we should look at the photograph of ourselves in these twelve tribes. Do not think that the prophecies in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30958" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> are only concerned with the sons of Jacob. These prophecies probably concern us more than they do Jacob’s twelve sons. </p>
<p data-content-id="bdPZiOYGTI0GDMWc0r7m5T_ENEaZCY4FzwTm0_1hM378LkILri-YBA6MHtvxUHmDQ"> The number twelve is composed of three times four. Firstly, Jacob prophesied concerning his first three sons, Reuben, Simeon, and Levi (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="30959" data-verses="Genesis 49:3-7">vv. 3-7</span>). These three brothers are subdivided. Reuben stands alone, and Simeon and Levi are grouped together. According to their activities, Simeon and Levi were one. </p>
<p data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYQo8MVksNMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx"> Before we examine the significant aspects of Jacob’s prophecy regarding Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, I wish to point out that according to Jacob’s prophecy with blessing, it is possible for our natural status and disposition to be changed. Perhaps you were born good. But do not be proud of your goodness, for you may become bad. If you were born bad, you should not be disappointed. Rather, you should have the faith that you will become good. This is both a warning and an encouragement. As the firstborn, Reuben had the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1245" id="1245">[1245]</span> preeminence. However, he lost his preeminence, and his natural status, his status by birth, was changed. Therefore, we should neither be disappointed nor complacent. Instead, we should be careful lest we lose our birthright. </p>
<p data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PZigHrVFAp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6"> Moreover, although you were not actually born first, you may become the firstborn. Joseph was born eleventh, but he eventually became the first. In most cases of the shifting of the birthright in the Bible, the birthright is shifted from the first to the second. Upon hearing this word, a thoughtful person may say, “I was born neither number one nor number two. I was born number eleven. No matter how many times the birthright is shifted, it will never be shifted to me.” But be confident and be encouraged. Although you may be number eleven, God still has a way to make you number one. He did it with Joseph. Be impressed with the fact that it is possible for your natural status to be changed either for the better or for the worse. Do not blame God for making you number eleven instead of number one. If we try to blame God in this way, He may say, “Dear child, read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30960" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> again. Although you were born number eleven, your status can be changed to number one.” </p>
<p data-content-id="BLE5KA_UJUWmNHemF8RznOyOercB0O1klPDPPz_cM4ETPjCdTs_KDy-6YMjsxBV2U"> Throughout the years, I have been speaking to the elders about their disposition. I admit that my word on this matter has been strong and sharp as a two-edged sword piercing into the brothers. When the elders ask me how they can be more useful, I always tell them that their usefulness depends upon their disposition. I have often told them that their natural disposition is the main reason they are not useful. Many have been disappointed by this word. But here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30961" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> there is some good news for those who have been disappointed about their natural disposition. In this group of three brothers we see not only that our natural status may be changed but also that our natural disposition can be used by God. However, as we shall see later in this message, God can use our disposition only if certain conditions are met. </p>
<p data-content-id="x52sBK0RPP8CO8qDhR2srpf2tnwO0DNKTmsXdJCAVgGjfw6s5s9H5KtPnduIvZkRU"> Jacob put Simeon and Levi together in his prophecy because they were the same in character and disposition. Their disposition was exposed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30962" data-verses="Genesis 34:1">chapter thirty-four</span>, the chapter that records the defilement of their sister, Dinah, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="1246" id="1246">[1246]</span> their revenge on Hamor and Shechem. Simeon, Levi, and Dinah were all born of the same mother. Thus, these brothers dearly loved their sister. When they learned that she had been defiled, their disposition was exposed by the way they killed all the males in the city of Shechem, plundered the city, and even hamstrung the cattle. How cruel they were! The cruelty of Simeon and Levi terrified Jacob. In his entire life Jacob had never been as frightened as he was in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30963" data-verses="Genesis 34:1">chapter thirty-four</span>. Nevertheless, in God’s sovereignty, the events in that chapter were a great help to Jacob’s maturity. These events were the strong sunshine that helped to burn Jacob into maturity. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30964" data-verses="Genesis 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span> we see a real change in Jacob’s life. </p>
<p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2Ox-InStiDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> Jacob, however, could not forget what Simeon and Levi had done. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30965" data-verses="Genesis 49:6">49:6</span> Jacob said of them, “O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their company, my glory, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they hamstrung oxen” (Heb.). The word “glory” (“honor” in KJV) refers to the spirit. What Simeon and Levi had done made such a deep impression on Jacob’s spirit that he could not grant them any blessing. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30966" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:1">Deuteronomy 33</span>, however, Moses did bless Levi. The blessing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30967" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> was by a father who had a loving concern for his sons. But the prophecy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="30968" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:1">Deuteronomy 33</span> was by an old man who represented the law. Whatever he prophesied was the judgment according to the law. Nevertheless, that judgment was filled with mercy, and Levi received a blessing. </p>

In order to understand these verses, we need a strong spirit and a clear mind. </p>
<p data-content-id="BLE5KA_UJUWmNHemF8RznOyKeqoh0O1klPDPPz_cM4ETPjCdTs_KDy-6YMjsxBV2U"> As I pointed out in the last message, the twelve sons of Jacob are divided into four groups of three. This is not according to my opinion; it is absolutely according to the arrangement of the Bible. The books of Moses reveal that the twelve sons of Jacob are arranged in three different orders: the order according to birth, the order according to blessing, and the order according to encampment. Let us first consider the order according to birth. Jacob’s twelve sons were born of four mothers. The first was Leah, Jacob’s proper wife. The first four sons, Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, were born of Leah. The second mother was a maid named Bilhah. Jacob’s fifth son, Dan, and his sixth, Naphtali, were born of her. Jacob’s seventh and eighth sons, Gad and Asher, were born of another maid, Zilpah. The ninth and the tenth, Issachar and Zebulun, were also born of Leah. Finally, Joseph, the eleventh, and Benjamin, the twelfth, were born of Rachel. This is the order according to birth. </p>
<p data-content-id="x52sBK0RPP8CO8qDhR2srpfytmUq0DNKTmsXdJCAVgGjfw6s5s9H5KtPnduIvZkRU"> In the order according to blessing, the first three sons are Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, the same as in the order according to birth. They are followed by Judah, Zebulun, and Issachar. Thus, the first two groups in the order according to blessing include the six sons born of Leah. However, in the order according to birth Issachar precedes Zebulun, but in the order according to blessing Zebulun comes before Issachar. The third group includes Dan, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali. According to <span class="pg" data-page-id="1258" id="1258">[1258]</span> birth, the order was Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher, but according to blessing, it is Dan, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali. Later we shall see that Gad was moved from this group and replaced Levi in the group with Reuben for encamping. The fourth group is composed of the sons of Rachel, Joseph and Benjamin, the same according to blessing as according to birth. (In the encampment, Joseph became two tribes through Ephraim and Manasseh.) </p>
<p data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw2Ox6IlGViDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb"> In the book of Numbers we see the order according to encampment. This book reveals that the twelve tribes of Israel were encamped around the tabernacle. At that time, they were armies, and they camped as armies. The arrangement of the tribes around the tabernacle went from the east, to the south, to the west, and then to the north. According to the encamping order, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun were on the east, toward the sun; Reuben, Simeon, and Gad on the south; Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin on the west; and Dan, Asher, and Naphtali on the north. Gad was placed with Reuben and Simeon because Levi had been uplifted and taken into the tabernacle, the center of the camp. Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin were the equivalent of Joseph and Benjamin. Through Ephraim and Manasseh, Joseph became two tribes to inherit the double portion of the land. </p>
<p data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNQey5HpsfFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B"> In the foregoing message we considered the first group in the order according to blessing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31006" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span>: Reuben, Simeon, and Levi. In that message we saw mainly the changing of the birthright and the transformation of the natural disposition. The outstanding feature of the first group is that it reveals that our natural status and disposition can be changed. In this message we come to the second group, composed of Judah, Zebulun, and Issachar. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31007" data-verses="Genesis 49:8-15">Verses 8 through 15</span> are very difficult to understand. In order to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31008" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span>, we must know the Bible in black and white. Furthermore, we must know the history of the children of Israel, we must have the experience of Christ and the church life, and we must know how to allegorize the Bible. If you do not know how to allegorize the Scriptures and interpret the poetry of the Bible, how could you be able to understand such a portion as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31009" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis chapter forty-nine</span>? In <span class="pg" data-page-id="1259" id="1259">[1259]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31010" data-verses="Genesis 49:9">verse 9</span> Judah is likened first to a young lion and then to a lioness, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31011" data-verses="Genesis 49:11">verse 11</span> speaks of the choice vine and of binding the foal to the vine. When those who oppose the allegorizing of the Bible read this portion of the Word, they will have no way to understand it. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31012" data-verses="Genesis 49:13">Verse 13</span> says that Zebulun will be a haven of ships and dwell at the haven of the sea; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31013" data-verses="Genesis 49:14">verse 14</span>, that Issachar is a strong ass couching between the sheepfolds; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31014" data-verses="Genesis 49:15">verse 15</span>, that Issachar saw that “rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant.” What does all this mean? Because this is so difficult, very few Christians have any understanding of it at all. The only way to understand it is to allegorize it. </p>
<p data-content-id="sHB9QAVlSM3v0XjManno-kQYrmHXfHA5fTkqfQSTHo75EQs1z1Iu7LXCJgPqSPnNs"> However, it is not an easy matter to allegorize the Bible. In order to understand such a portion as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31015" data-verses="Genesis 49:8-15">49:8-15</span>, we need several things: the knowledge of the Bible in black and white; the knowledge of the history of the children of Israel; the experiences of Christ and the church life; the wisdom to allegorize the Bible; and the knowledge of how to apply the types to today’s situation. When we have all this, then we shall be able to see the true significance of this portion of the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XQ55rdprIw1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW"> The Bible is very economical. Not one word is wasted. Jacob’s prophecy with blessing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31016" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span> is poetry. Poetry is the most thoughtful and meaningful form of writing. Jacob’s utterance of prophecy with blessing is stately and filled with grandeur. </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="LD01-v3um3NuLShGttlViom2nW7MRg9jsTHcyuTXlEDKbBHncuqREEkOSwGaFv9xn">(7) Concerning Judah</h2><p data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD0Vu90CL7iWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP"> As we consider these verses, we need to be impressed with the fact that in the first group, composed of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, Christ has not yet come. We do not see Christ in Reuben, in Simeon, or in Levi. What we see in Levi is his absoluteness, his desperation, and his faithfulness. It was due to these characteristics that the Lord gave him the priesthood. Although Levi had the priesthood with the Urim and Thummim, we do not see Christ in him. Only when Judah comes does Christ appear. Judah typifies Christ. In fact, we may even substitute the name of Christ for Judah in this prophecy. Although Jacob had twelve sons, Christ came only out of Judah. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31017" data-verses="Revelation 5:5">Revelation 5:5</span> He is called the Lion of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1260" id="1260">[1260]</span> tribe of Judah. Hence, because Christ came out of Judah, He belongs to Judah. In order to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31018" data-verses="Genesis 49:8-12">verses 8 through 12</span>, we must apply these verses to Christ and substitute the name of Christ for Judah. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROmJDRTljOOlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX"> We can all testify from our experience that once we were Reubens. Were you not a sinful Reuben before you were saved? Were you not, like Reuben, one boiling over with lust? We also were Simeons, those who were natural and filled with the natural disposition. Everything we did was according to our lusts and our disposition. But praise the Lord that we were saved and became a Levi! Now we are qualified to come into the presence of God and, with the Urim and Thummim, to receive God’s vision and God’s revelation. Furthermore, as priests, we can bring others into God’s presence and learn the Lord’s mind regarding them. Is not your experience somewhat like this? Although you may be the least among the saints, day by day you come into the presence of the Lord. As you stand in His presence, you sense that there is something shining and enlightening within you. This is the Urim and the Thummim. At times you bring others to the Lord and pray for them. Perhaps you say, “O Lord, remember my father, my brother-in-law, and my sister-in-law.” This is the priesthood. Neither Reuben nor Simeon had a function like this. Only Levi did. And we also have it today. We are no longer Reuben and Simeon; rather, we are today’s Levi. </p>
<p data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9BlbphLAW6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr"> However, although I had been a Levi for years, I can testify that I had little experience of Christ. Thus, in addition to the experience of Levi, we need the experience of Judah, that is, the experience of Christ. It is good to come into the presence of the Lord to receive enlightenment, revelation, and vision, and it is good to bring others into His presence. Nevertheless, we still need Christ as a young lion, the Lion of the tribe of Judah. Have you ever experienced Him as a strong lion? As the young lion, Christ is for fighting, for putting His hand on the neck of His enemies. To place the hand on the neck of our enemies means to defeat them, to subdue them, and to gain the victory over them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1261" id="1261">[1261]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="oojwSJGvLbmiYj5tIQGorZwUH4L44PdhX0jmIOM9tm0WtyG5HMI5sjMdIyAZ1hq_3"> In this message I am burdened to give a further word on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31056" data-verses="Genesis 49:8-15">49:8-15</span>. The language used to describe the group composed of Judah, Zebulun, and Issachar is strange, new, and foreign to our understanding. In these verses a number of figures are used in relation to Judah: a young lion, a couching lion, a lioness, the scepter, the ruler’s staff, the foal bound to the vine, the ass’s colt bound to the choice vine, the garments washed in wine, and the clothes washed in grape juice. Have you ever heard of someone washing his garments in wine or his clothes in grape juice? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31057" data-verses="Genesis 49:12">Verse 12</span> speaks of eyes that are red with wine and teeth that are white with milk. With respect to Zebulun we have the figure of a “haven of ships” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31058" data-verses="Genesis 49:13">v. 13</span>), and Issachar is likened to a “strong ass couching down between the sheepfolds” who sees that the rest is good and that the land is pleasant and who bows his shoulder to become a servant under taskwork (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31059" data-verses="Genesis 49:14-15">vv. 14-15</span>, Heb.). All these points are rich, and we need to be impressed with them. </p>
<p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQapUxrnl8HTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> None of these points could be covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31060" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, an account of God’s creation. According to the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31061" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, on the sixth day God made man in His own image. At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31062" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> it was impossible to have a word about Judah being a young lion, a couching lion, and a lioness, or a word about tying our donkey to the vine. Neither was it possible to hear of garments washed in wine. Although in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31063" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we have a garden and the two trees, we find none of the points mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31064" data-verses="Genesis 49:8-15">49:8-15</span>. Because these matters are part of the prophecy with blessing uttered by a man who was <span class="pg" data-page-id="1272" id="1272">[1272]</span> both transformed and mature in the divine life, they can only be found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31065" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYhwpYsf065oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31066" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> Adam was wonderful, for he was able to give names to all the animals. This indicates that he was very capable. However, although he could name the animals, he could not utter a prophecy with blessing. Adam was merely a created being. He did not have the divine life wrought into him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31067" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span> he had not yet fallen. In a sense, we need to appreciate the fall of man. The children who fall the most are the strongest. A child who has never fallen is surely very weak. Adam, the man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31068" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, was perfect, but he was not very strong. However, Jacob, the man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31069" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span>, was not only perfect, but also strong. If this transformed Jacob had been surrounded by serpents, he still would not have fallen. Instead, he would have crushed the head of those serpents and cut off their tails. Which do you prefer to be—Adam in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31070" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapter one</span> or Jacob in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31071" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span>? I prefer to be Jacob. </p>
<p data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0YLTVYqG8onn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31072" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span> Jacob uttered a prophetic blessing which Adam could never have spoken. Only Jacob was qualified to utter such a blessing. Adam, however, was altogether unqualified for this because he did not have the divine life wrought into him and he was never transformed or matured in the life of God. But Jacob was not only created and fallen; he was regenerated, and the divine life had been wrought into him. Although there is no record that Adam’s name was changed, we are told that Jacob’s name was changed to Israel. Adam means “red earth,” but Israel means “the prince of God.” Do you prefer to be red earth or the prince of God? Red earth can never prophesy such a word as Jacob spoke in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31073" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="YWQf39oOaKT-w18LKhlsiptAn-gsDjHh52RJBmzJk0PH2LSkAzFUEZelzC01-ioTH"> Jacob passed through the full experience of man’s fall. I doubt that anyone else has ever fallen as low as Jacob. Although Jacob’s story is our biography, we cannot compare with him as far as the fall is concerned. Jacob was the expert in being fallen. No one can surpass him in this matter. Jacob cheated, robbed, and supplanted everyone, including his mother. The fact that he utilized his mother proves that he supplanted her. (To supplant a person is simply to utilize him, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1273" id="1273">[1273]</span> to usurp him.) On one occasion Jacob even did his best to supplant God. That night at Peniel Jacob exercised all his energy to grasp God, to supplant Him, and to compel Him to do something for him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31074" data-verses="Genesis 32:24-31">32:24-31</span>). Jacob, of course, could not defeat God. Eventually, God touched his thigh, and Jacob became lame. Because Jacob supplanted everyone, he fell all the way to the bottom. Nevertheless, eventually he was transformed and matured and reached the peak of the experience of the divine life. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31075" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span> he was able to speak a rich word of prophecy with blessing. </p>
<p data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKRhiUn3g_CaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI"> Prior to this chapter it was impossible for such a word to be spoken, for there was no one transformed and mature enough to do it. Furthermore, before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31076" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span> the proper environment had not been created. The imparting of a heavenly vision always requires a suitable environment. In order for Jacob to speak the word recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31077" data-verses="Genesis 49:8-15">49:8-15</span>, he had to be transformed and matured, and he had to have the sons over whom to prophesy. Let us now consider the spiritual significance of the blessing prophesied in these verses, a portion of the Word that requires the entire Bible for its development. </p>

This proves that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31081" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> needs <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31082" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">Revelation 5</span> for its development. It also proves that these verses of Jacob’s prophetic blessing require the whole Bible for their development. My burden in this message is to impress you with the spiritual interpretation of these verses. </p>
<p data-content-id="oojwSJGvLbmiYj5tIQGorZwUH5Pc4PdhX0jmIOM9tm0WtyG5HMI5sjMdIyAZ1hq_3"> We have seen that Genesis is a book of seeds. Nearly all the truths in the Bible are sown as seeds in Genesis. In the New Testament there are three main truths concerning Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQapUxrmREHTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> The first is the truth of the victory of Christ. The fact that Christ is victorious means that He has accomplished everything God required of Him. In this accomplished work He took care of sin, solved the problem of the world, defeated Satan, abolished death, and eliminated every negative thing. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1274" id="1274">[1274]</span> He has gained the full victory for the accomplishment of God’s purpose. This is the victory of Christ, the first basic truth in the New Testament regarding Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYhwpYseQG5oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa"> The second main truth is the truth of the authority of Christ, the kingdom of Christ. Because Christ has won the victory, He has been made Lord of all. All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31083" data-verses="Matthew 28:18">Matt. 28:18</span>). Furthermore, He has received the universal and eternal kingdom of His Father. Thus, He has the authority, the kingship, and the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0YLTVYoSMonn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF"> The third main truth in the New Testament concerning Christ is the truth of the enjoyment and rest in Christ. Christ has accomplished everything in His victory and He has received the authority and the kingdom so that we may have enjoyment and find rest in Him. What enjoyment and rest we have in Christ! These three truths are a summary of the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="YWQf39oOaKT-w18LKhlsiptAn8kYDjHh52RJBmzJk0PH2LSkAzFUEZelzC01-ioTH"> Because the New Testament is the harvest of the seeds sown in Genesis, we must now locate the seeds of Christ’s victory, of Christ’s kingdom, and of the enjoyment and rest in Christ. They are found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31084" data-verses="Genesis 49:8-12">Genesis 49:8-12</span>. These five verses contain three wonderful seeds: the seed of Christ’s victory, the seed of Christ’s kingdom, and the seed of the enjoyment and rest in Christ. How I thank the Lord and worship Him that, at this end time, He has opened this portion of the Word to us! </p>

<p data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_KVPOUPF0w3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj"> According to the Old Testament, the twelve sons of Jacob are arranged in four groups of three. Jacob’s prophetic word of blessing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31118" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span> is based upon these groups. We have already covered the first group, the group of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi. That group was utterly evil in the eyes of God. Reuben was defiled, and Simeon and Levi were cruel. The record of the first group is the beginning of the record of the twelve sons of Jacob. What a poor beginning it was! However, this should be an encouragement to us because our beginning was also very poor. </p>
<p data-content-id="NgrUOPst9ndCGqPDKS1sOGs25C7xKLEkyN_8bfWBSPyO-5g1-dnym0-8I86wUsKBc"> The second group is composed of Judah, Zebulun, and Issachar. Because Christ comes in with this group, it is the group of victory. In this group we have the gospel, the preaching of the gospel, and the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="topU0NZPOs7b25ters3Gc5GZK3GthSqSpV5hz_XoXr_MU93J_kJdBBom0evJv9lGi"> Some may think that it is too much to say that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31119" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> we find the preaching of the gospel and the church life as the issue of that preaching. Remember, the first tribe in the second group is Judah, and the most significant aspect of the record concerning Judah is the lion. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31120" data-verses="Genesis 49:9">Verse 9</span> says, “Judah is a young lion: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he couches, he lies down as a lion, and as a lioness” (Heb.). This verse is interpreted by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31121" data-verses="Revelation 5:5">Revelation 5:5</span>, where Christ is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah. Without <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31122" data-verses="Revelation 5:5">Revelation 5:5</span>, it would be difficult to interpret <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31123" data-verses="Genesis 49:9">Genesis 49:9</span>. But with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31124" data-verses="Revelation 5:5">Revelation 5:5</span> before us, no one can deny that Judah signifies Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1286" id="1286">[1286]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="h08U91ltZnqTUI0aV0g57nymiKoCCw-cZTKHrVo12qTwS3OgmpjHqkUk9BKO83GId"> Although the New Testament often interprets the signs and symbols in the Old Testament, it does not always give every detail of these interpretations. Regarding Judah as a lion, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31125" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> has three aspects: the young lion, the couching lion, and the lioness. Revelation, however, simply speaks of the Lion of the tribe of Judah in a general way, saying nothing of these detailed aspects. Those who are legal would say, “Now don’t go too far. We can only say what the New Testament says. We must not say any more.” This is legality. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31126" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> reveals that Judah is a lion in three aspects, but the New Testament only gives us an interpretation in a general way. Why then should we not continue on to supply the interpretations of the details? </p>
<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UXIx7BGs2tXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> There are at least two or three places where the New Testament indicates that it did not tell us everything (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31127" data-verses="Hebrews 5:11">Heb. 5:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31128" data-verses="Hebrews 9:5">9:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31129" data-verses="Hebrews 11:32">11:32</span>). Consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31130" data-verses="Hebrews 11:32">Hebrews 11:32</span>: “And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, and both David and Samuel, and the prophets.” Here the writer of Hebrews seems to be saying, “I do not have time to tell you everything. I have only included part of what the Old Testament says. I have left a great deal untouched.” What then should we do about this? We must go to the Lord ourselves and inquire of Him. The writer of Hebrews took the lead to give us a way to interpret the Old Testament. He did not have the time to interpret everything for us. He left something for us to work out by going directly to the Lord ourselves. No one can disagree with this principle. Nevertheless, some Christian teachers argue that if the New Testament does not speak about a certain thing, we should not say anything about it either. </p>
<p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KbZzlnRfTe1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> Although there is a very clear interpretation of Judah in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31131" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">Revelation 5</span>, what is spoken in the New Testament concerning Zebulun and Issachar? There is a partial interpretation of Zebulun in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31132" data-verses="Matthew 4:15">Matthew 4:15</span>, but there is no interpretation whatever of Issachar. According to those who insist that we should be silent when the New Testament is silent, we should not say anything about Issachar. But we do not agree with such a short-sighted concept. The fact that the tribe of Judah has a spiritual significance is fully proved by <span class="pg" data-page-id="1287" id="1287">[1287]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31133" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">Revelation 5</span>. Should not the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar have a spiritual significance as well? Would there be a spiritual significance to Judah, but no spiritual significance to the other tribes in the same group? To say this is not logical; it is absurd. </p>
<p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q-SQQ1DalgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> As we pointed out in the foregoing message, with Judah there are three main points: the victory of Christ, the kingdom of Christ, and the rest in the enjoyment of Christ’s riches in life. We see the victory of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31134" data-verses="Genesis 49:8-9">verses 8 and 9</span>, the kingdom of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31135" data-verses="Genesis 49:10">verse 10</span>, and the rest and enjoyment of Christ’s riches in life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31136" data-verses="Genesis 49:11-12">verses 11 and 12</span>. These three points are not an arbitrary interpretation of these verses. If you think my interpretation is arbitrary, I would ask you why in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31137" data-verses="Genesis 49:9">verse 9</span> the young lion is mentioned before the couching lion and the lioness. Why is there this sequence? Why is the lioness not put first? Following the threefold mention of the lion, we have in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31138" data-verses="Genesis 49:10">verse 10</span> the scepter and the ruler’s staff, denoting the kingship and the kingdom. Why does the kingdom follow the lion? Why is it not mentioned first? After the kingship, we have, as the third item, the rest in the enjoyment of Christ’s riches in life. If you do not follow the interpretation put forth in the previous message regarding binding the donkey to the vine, how do you interpret these words? What do they mean? Furthermore, what does it mean to wash your garments in the wine? Also, what is the meaning of eyes that are red with wine and teeth that are white with milk? As the New Testament only gives us the interpretation for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31139" data-verses="Genesis 49:9">verse 9</span> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31140" data-verses="Revelation 5:5">Revelation 5:5</span>, there should be some interpretations for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31141" data-verses="Genesis 49:11-12">verses 11 and 12</span>. What are these interpretations? Concerning all the points in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31142" data-verses="Genesis 49:9-12">verses 9 through 12</span>, we need to spend much time quietly in the presence of the Lord, saying, “Lord, what would You say about this? What does it mean to bind the donkey to the vine?” The Lord would say, “If you look into the Bible, you would see that a donkey is used for journeying toward a goal. This journeying donkey is always laboring.” Then you would say, “Surely I am such a donkey. I need to bind this donkey to the vine.” The vine spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31143" data-verses="Genesis 49:11">verse 11</span> is Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31144" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15:1</span> Christ said, “I am the true vine.” Thus, to bind the donkey to the vine means to <span class="pg" data-page-id="1288" id="1288">[1288]</span> bind our donkey to Christ. This is just one illustration of the correct way to understand this portion of the Word. </p>

<p data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3OgkPD2ZITDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31145" data-verses="Genesis 49:13">Verse 13</span> says, “Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for a haven of ships.” This verse does not say, “Zebulun shall dwell at the stable full of horses and donkeys.” Furthermore, it does not say that Zebulun would dwell on the mountain. The tribe of Judah dwelt in hilly country, in the region around Mount Zion, where the capital of the nation was located. Zebulun, however, dwelt at the haven of the sea. This is very meaningful. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PRIl_6fWVG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> Judah signifies the victorious Christ, the One who gained the victory for the kingdom so that His people may rest in Him. Surely Judah must dwell on the mountain. But Zebulun dwelt at the haven of the sea, at a seaport. A port is for exporting goods, for sending out ships. Thus far in this portion of the Word, we have seen two methods of transportation: donkeys and ships. Pictures like these are often used in the Bible. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31146" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span> says, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” This simple picture of the Lamb of God depicts a great deal. Likewise, much is portrayed by the pictures of the donkey and the ships in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31147" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span>. A donkey is an animal that transports things by its own labor. But in the ancient times the ships sailed by the power of the heavenly wind. No doubt this refers to the shipping out of the gospel of Christ. Judah was the factory producing the gospel, and Zebulun was the haven exporting the gospel produced by Judah. </p>

<p data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXlUvxgMS0wrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip"> In this message we come to the third group of Jacob’s twelve sons. As we have seen clearly, the prophecy with blessing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31190" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> portrays not only the lives of the twelve tribes of Israel in the Old Testament, but also the spiritual life of Christians in the New Testament. This is based on the principle that the twelve tribes of Israel are a type of the church with all the believers. Thus, everything in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31191" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span> is a type, a shadow, a picture, and our experience today is the reality, the fulfillment, of Jacob’s prophecy with blessing. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LnYUmaBjKrZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> The prophecy with blessing uttered by Jacob is poetry. It is difficult to understand the language of poetry. Poetic language is meaningful and descriptive, but it is not easy to probe the depths of its meaning. If you are able to probe into the depths of the poetic language in this chapter, you will realize how meaningful, rich, and profound it is. </p>
<p data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtrIGsiKPD_u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m"> There is another reason many readers of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31192" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span> have difficulty understanding it, and that reason is the shortage in their Christian experience. Even if we are able to understand the poetic language in this chapter, we may lack the experience necessary to know how to make the application. In order to understand such a prophetic record, we must know the language in black and white, we must know the history of the twelve tribes of Israel, we must know the significance of the poetic figures, and we must have experience. Jacob used many poetic figures in this chapter: a young lion, a couching lion, a lioness, a foal, a young donkey, wine, the vine, garments, the haven, ships, the serpent, and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1300" id="1300">[1300]</span> horned snake. In order to know the significance of these figures and to know how to interpret all these types and apply them to our situation, we need experience. The reason this chapter has been closed for centuries is this lack of experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="6CXs4WE0BL6-B1B4FDiAErJEucj3zGKjTYJeRnGmeXBe72gXmUfpgBoC9qhDjO81n"> More than fifty years ago, I sat at the feet of a great Brethren teacher. He gave a number of messages expounding <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31193" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span>, showing us how these prophecies were fulfilled in the following books of the Bible. However, he had a great shortage in the matter of experience. All he had was the knowledge of the language in black and white. But because he did not know the spiritual significance of the figures, he did not apply any of them to today’s Christian experience. Therefore, I did not receive from him any help in life or spiritual experiences. Nevertheless, I still thank God that I heard from him the interpretation and exposition of this chapter in a historical and scriptural way. Later, by putting this chapter together with my spiritual experience, I was able to get into the depths of the significance of this prophecy with blessing. </p>
<p data-content-id="R_GfdTPWaEiXNNW82-yDbXFzDjqGLG6UWYb4K416h7Rart6vExDqqOyU38XwPBejO"> This record concerning Jacob’s twelve sons begins with Reuben, a sinner. No one has been more sinful than Reuben. Although Paul said that he was the chief of sinners, I would say that Reuben was actually the foremost sinner, more sinful than Saul of Tarsus. What a terrible sin he committed! At the beginning of our Christian experience we also were sinners. How we thank the Lord for His mercy! Although I was once a Reuben, now I have been saved. Although this prophecy with blessing begins with a sinner, it ends with the two beloved sons of Jacob, Joseph and Benjamin. It begins with a sinner and ends with a king, a reigning one, one in power and authority. Between Reuben and Joseph we have Simeon, Levi, Judah, Zebulun, Issachar, Dan, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali. </p>
<p data-content-id="E-xv1nlZl2LrnNkDtbmzPfo6duSStUIFb3C0mvDz1LtjokSWkphwKc-Ng-yoBiibt"> We have seen that this prophetic record begins with a group of sinners, Reuben, Simeon, and Levi. Reuben’s sin was lust, and the sin of Simeon and Levi was the anger that issued from their disposition. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31194" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">Matthew chapter five</span> also speaks of the sins of lust and anger. After this group of sinners, who were filled with lust and anger, Christ came in as the lion. Judah is Christ as our glad tidings. Following him is <span class="pg" data-page-id="1301" id="1301">[1301]</span> Zebulun, the haven for shipping out the gospel, and Issachar, the enjoyment of the church life. How wonderful! Are there still some Reubens among us today? We have to declare that in the church there are no Reubens and no Simeons and that all the Levis have become priests. Thus, there are no more sinners. Christ is here and He is everything. Because Christ is here, we have the glad tidings that are shipped out through the preaching of the gospel, and we have the church life. Hallelujah, we are no longer sinners! We are in the church life. On the one hand, we are the haven to ship out Christ; on the other hand, we are the tents to stay with Christ in the full enjoyment of Him. </p>

<p data-content-id="gUDsBBjBPjRtaf2PAgd0QI2eJne1KXdsQrQ3vEcVWKTvzkKR8PehPPTdnoCg5OrXo"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31195" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:22">Deuteronomy 33:22</span> says, “And of Dan he said, Dan is a young lion: he shall leap from Bashan” (Heb.). The mention of the young lion in this verse links the second and third groups of the twelve sons, showing that the third group is the continuation of the second. The crucial figure in the second group is the lion; and Dan, the first of the third group, is also called a lion. As a young lion, Dan is not fighting for the prey, but for more land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31196" data-verses="Joshua 19:47">Josh. 19:47</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31197" data-verses="Judges 18:27-29">Judg. 18:27-29</span>). By this we see that the young lion has progressed from fighting for the prey to fighting for the land. In typology, to fight for more land means to fight for more Christ. The young lion in Judah was for seizing the prey. But the young lion here is fighting for more land, fighting to gain more Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31198" data-verses="Judges 18:1">Judges 18</span> we see Dan as a young lion, fighting for more land. </p>

At that time God’s tabernacle was in Shiloh. But in the city of Dan there was an idol. Today we have the light to understand the spiritual significance of this. It means that some Christians have been able to gain more of Christ. But after gaining <span class="pg" data-page-id="1302" id="1302">[1302]</span> more of Christ, they set up another center of worship. According to the book of Deuteronomy, in the good land there should have been only one center of worship for God’s people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31202" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:11">Deut. 12:11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31203" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:13-14">13-14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31204" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:21">21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31205" data-verses="Deuteronomy 14:23-26">14:23-26</span>). At that unique center there were God’s name and God’s habitation. During the time of the book of Judges, the center of worship was in Shiloh, where God’s tabernacle and priests were. Although Dan gained the victory, this victory made him independent. All independence comes from pride. Do not think that spiritual gain cannot make you proud. Even the gain of Christ can make us proud. This is what is called spiritual pride. Those who are spiritually proud will not be subject to others. Rather, they say, “Why must we go to Shiloh? We can set up something ourselves.” Immediately after Dan’s victory, another center of worship, with the idol made by Micah, was established in the city of Dan. </p>
<p data-content-id="NgrUOPst9ndCGqPDKS1sOGs65DPBKLEkyN_8bfWBSPyO-5g1-dnym0-8I86wUsKBc"> If you consider the history of Christianity, you will see that this kind of thing has happened again and again. A certain individual or group of believers has been victorious in gaining more of Christ. But this gain of Christ made them proud and independent. Because they were not willing to submit to others, they set up another center of worship. They should have gone to the worship center in Shiloh, for the priests ordained by God were in Shiloh. But they set up something man-made and man-ordained. This is the creeping in of the serpent, the subtle one. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD1X-V0CvfiWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP">THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF DAN,<br/>GAD, ASHER, AND NAPHTALI</h1><p data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROnLT5Tk32OlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX"> In this message I am burdened to give an additional word concerning the spiritual significance of Dan, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali. In a sense, I love this group more than the group that includes Judah. Judah’s group is the second, and this group is the third, which, of course, is more advanced. We have seen that there is a link in this third group connecting it with the second. Judah is a young lion and a lioness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31249" data-verses="Genesis 49:9">49:9</span>, Heb.), Dan is a young lion, and Gad is a lioness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31250" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:22">Deut. 33:22</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31251" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:20">20</span>, Heb.). Thus, these two figures, the young lion and the lioness, link the third group to the second. </p>
<p data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9AnLBhKEq6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr"> When I was young, I often studied <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31252" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span>. Many times I felt that these words were not very meaningful. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31253" data-verses="Genesis 49:21">verse 21</span> says that Naphtali is a hind let loose and that he gives beautiful words (Heb.). I could not understand how a hind could give beautiful words. It seemed to me that the hind and the beautiful words were not related to each other. Furthermore, I wondered how a hind could speak. Consequently, for quite a long period of time, I did not care for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31254" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span>. However, when we probe into the spiritual significance of this chapter, we see how meaningful all of it is. In message one hundred we considered the rest in the enjoyment of Christ’s riches in life (pp. 1279-1284). We saw that we need to bind our donkey to the vine and soak our garments in wine. If we do this, our eyes will be red with wine and our teeth white with milk (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31255" data-verses="Genesis 49:11-12">vv. 11-12</span>). One brother may ask another, “Have you bound your donkey to the vine?” The other may reply, “Brother, have you soaked your garments in wine?” Then the first brother may ask, “Are your eyes red with wine?” The second may respond, “Are your teeth <span class="pg" data-page-id="1316" id="1316">[1316]</span> white with milk?” The outsiders may think that this is the secret, mysterious language of the church people. No matter what others may say, how meaningful these new proverbs are to us! “Bind your donkey to the vine!” “Soak your garments in wine!” I want my eyes to be red with wine and my teeth to be white with milk. In order for this to take place, we must first rest in Christ and then soak our being, our behavior, in the riches of the life of Christ. Then we shall experience transformation, and our appearance will be changed. Our eyes will be red with wine, and our teeth will be white with milk, indicating that they are strong to take in the Word and to utter it to others. </p>
<p data-content-id="FyrUURSenH7AUUlr0ndgduMMHnz-vlth22OadvBKOnc_QUvWSaFJlMIPAfMT2Bdu2"> The sequence in these four groups in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31256" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span> is marvelous. It corresponds both to the history of the church and our spiritual experience. Firstly, we have Reuben, signifying that we all began as sinners. After Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, Judah comes. This means that Christ has come as the victorious lion. Following Judah, Zebulun, and Issachar, we have the fall of Dan. Dan’s fall, however, was not only a failure and a defeat; it was apostasy. After the apostasy of Dan, we have the recovery with Gad, the sufficiency in Asher, and the consummation with Naphtali. In church history we also see the apostasy, the recovery, the sufficiency, and the consummation. If we cannot see the consummation today, we shall surely see it in the next age and especially in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem. Naphtali will be completely fulfilled when New Jerusalem is manifested in the new heaven and new earth. The New Jerusalem will be the eternal Naphtali. These four items—apostasy, recovery, sufficiency, and consummation—also match our Christian experience. After a downfall, the apostasy, we have the recovery. Then come sufficiency and consummation. We have seen these things in the Lord’s recovery. Throughout the years in the recovery we have been with Judah, binding our donkey to the vine and soaking our garments in wine. Our eyes have become red with wine and our teeth white with milk. But suddenly the apostasy of Dan came in. Nevertheless, following Dan there was the recovery with Gad. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1317" id="1317">[1317]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q-SQY1BeJgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> Dan was the continuation of Judah, for Judah was a lion and Dan was a young lion. As the continuation of Judah, Dan was successful in gaining more Christ by his victorious life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31257" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:22">Deut. 33:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31258" data-verses="Joshua 19:47">Josh. 19:47</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31259" data-verses="Judges 18:27-29">Judg. 18:27-29</span>). </p>

He cared only for himself, not for others. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31260" data-verses="Judges 18:30">Judges 18:30</span> says, “The children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image” (Heb.). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkx_BeeNTuoPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU">C. Setting Up a Divisive Center of Worship<br/>and Ordaining a Hired “Priest”</h2><p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j7P6dabiP9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> Dan’s apostasy was the setting up of a divisive center of worship (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31261" data-verses="Judges 18:30-31">Judg. 18:30-31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31262" data-verses="Judges 17:9-10">17:9-10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31263" data-verses="1Kings 12:26-31">1 Kings 12:26-31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31264" data-verses="2Kings 10:29">2 Kings 10:29</span>). In a divisive way Dan set up a center apparently for the worship of God. Many use the matter of the worship of God as a cloak for setting up a divisive center. Some would say, “What could be wrong with doing such a thing for the worship of God? Isn’t it better to set up a center of worship than to go to a movie theater?” According to the history in the Old Testament, nothing throughout the generations was more sinful or more damaging to God’s people than Dan’s act of setting up a divisive center of worship. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31265" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:1">Deuteronomy 12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31266" data-verses="Deuteronomy 14:1">14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31267" data-verses="Deuteronomy 15:1">15</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31268" data-verses="Deuteronomy 16:1">16</span> the Lord through Moses charged the children of Israel at least fifteen times not to offer their burnt offerings in the place of their choice. They were commanded to go to the unique place the Lord had chosen for His name and for His habitation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31269" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:13-14">Deuteronomy 12:13 and 14</span> say, “Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest: but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.” The Lord seemed to be saying, “When you enter into the good land, you must not offer your burnt offerings in any of the places you see. You must go to the unique place, the place I have chosen <span class="pg" data-page-id="1318" id="1318">[1318]</span> for My name and My habitation. You have no right to choose any other place. You must go to this unique center. It is this center that keeps My people in oneness.” Again and again Moses, the elderly, loving lawgiver, charged the children of Israel concerning this matter. If you read these chapters, you will see that Moses charged the people concerning the unique place, the place the Lord had chosen for His name and for His habitation. The reason the Lord commanded Moses to issue this charge repeatedly was that He was concerned about maintaining the unity of His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hiI9AH8T5cGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD"> After the children of Israel entered the good land, the tabernacle, the house of God, was in Shiloh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31270" data-verses="Judges 18:31">Judg. 18:31</span>). As long as the tabernacle was in Shiloh, Shiloh was the unique center for the worship of God. As the unique center, it should have maintained the unity of God’s people. However, Dan set up another center in the north, which caused the first division among the children of Israel. In this way God’s people were divided, not by a movie theater, but by a worship center. Today Christians excuse themselves by saying, “We are doing something here for the worship of God. What is wrong with this? God is not narrow; He is omnipresent. You have Him with you in your place. Is He not also here with us in our place? Certainly God is not as narrow as you are. He is everywhere. How can you limit Him to a particular place?” Nevertheless, God enjoys being limited for the purpose of keeping the unity of His people. Most Christians today are too free. Like the Danites, they feel free to set up another center of worship. </p>

<p data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnnWNwK7svQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM"> In this message we come to the last group of Jacob’s twelve sons mentioned in his prophecy with blessing, the group composed of Joseph and Benjamin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31323" data-verses="Genesis 49:22-27">49:22-27</span>). The twelve tribes of the sons of Jacob in the Old Testament are always grouped together. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31324" data-verses="Numbers 2:1">Numbers 2</span> we see the arrangement of the twelve tribes around the tabernacle: Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun on the east; Reuben, Simeon, and Gad on the south; Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin on the west; and Dan, Asher, and Naphtali on the north. </p>
<p data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-yts0f2AL1tlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo"> Among the twelve sons of Jacob, only three were types of Christ: Judah, Joseph, and Benjamin. Judah was a type of Christ as the overcoming victorious Lion. Joseph was a type of Christ as the beloved Son of the Father bringing all the riches to feed the world. Benjamin was a type of the ascended, exalted Christ. When he was born, his mother called him Benoni, which means “son of sorrow,” but his father changed his name to Benjamin, which means “son of the right hand.” Therefore, Judah, Joseph, and Benjamin typify Christ in a full way. Although Reuben was the firstborn, he lost the birthright because of his defilement. Hence, in God’s administration, Judah took the lead. However, without Joseph and Benjamin, the history and significance of the twelve tribes of Jacob would have no conclusion. Joseph and Benjamin provide an adequate, full conclusion of the history of the twelve sons of Jacob. </p>
<p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXR0jJfp4i443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> The twelve sons of Jacob are a complete type of God’s people, including all of us. We have seen that the history of God’s people begins with sinners, for we were all sinners like <span class="pg" data-page-id="1332" id="1332">[1332]</span> Reuben, Simeon, and Levi. Reuben was full of lust, and Simeon and Levi were full of anger. Thus, the history of God’s people began with sinners who were full of lust and anger. Then came Christ, typified by Judah. Later Naphtali appeared as a hind set loose and giving beautiful words. If the history of God’s people ended with Naphtali, it would be good, but not adequate. For an adequate conclusion both Joseph and Benjamin are needed. </p>
<p data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkx_BCePHOoPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU"> This history of God’s people begins with sinners. Eventually these sinners are transformed into Levis with the priesthood and even into Judahs with the kingship. Then Naphtali, the resurrected Christ, brings forth beautiful words. This means that we once were Reubens and Simeons, but we need to be transformed into Levis, Judahs, and Naphtalis. Furthermore, we must go on to become Josephs and Benjamins. </p>
<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j7P6BaZmr9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> Before we consider the significant aspects of Joseph and Benjamin, I wish to point out that Joseph and Benjamin, two sons born of one mother, Rachel, are two aspects of one person. When Jacob saw Rachel, he fell in love with her, and his heart was set on her. However, he did not firstly marry Rachel, but Leah, who brought forth six sons. Although children had also been born to the maids of Rachel and Leah, Rachel herself did not bear any children until ten sons had been born. Only then did Rachel give birth to Joseph, whose very name indicated that another was to be added. This signifies that in himself there was no completion with Joseph; there was the need of another part. Benjamin, therefore, was Joseph’s completion. Thus, Joseph and Benjamin are one. If you read the Old Testament, you will see that it places Joseph and Benjamin together as a unit. Eventually, Joseph received the birthright and through his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, inherited the double portion of the land. In this way Joseph became two tribes, the tribe of Ephraim and the tribe of Manasseh. Furthermore, the tribe of Manasseh received two portions of the land: one half of this tribe received land on the east of the Jordan River, and the other half received land on the west. Joseph and Benjamin are one. The fact that Joseph was the eleventh son and Benjamin, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1333" id="1333">[1333]</span> twelfth indicates that they were close to each other in sequence. Thus, among the twelve sons, Joseph and Benjamin were the last pair. Later they became the three tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin, which were encamped at the rear of God’s dwelling place. Judah was the leading tribe in the front of the tabernacle, but Joseph was at the rear. </p>
<p data-content-id="h08U91ltZnqTUI0aV0g57nyyiI8qCw-cZTKHrVo12qTwS3OgmpjHqkUk9BKO83GId"> Let us now consider the significant aspects of this group. Joseph was very faithful, and he was absolutely victorious. According to the record of the Old Testament, Joseph was the first perfect person. No one who preceded him, including Noah, was perfect. But in Joseph we can find no fault; he was utterly perfect in his behavior. Joseph was perfect because he was altogether victorious. Furthermore, the Old Testament likens Joseph to an ox full of strength (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31325" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:17">Deut. 33:17</span>, Heb.). He was not a fierce lion or a threatening wolf, but an ox full of strength. As an ox, Joseph had two horns: Ephraim and Manasseh. With these two horns Joseph will push the peoples together to the ends of the earth. This indicates that Joseph is strong in victory. </p>
<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UXIxvBEoatXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> Joseph also trusted in God and believed in Him. Because Joseph was perfect and victorious, and because he trusted in God, God blessed him. No one in the Bible received a blessing greater than that given to Joseph. As we shall see, he was blessed with ten items in time and in space, with everything from eternity past to eternity future and from heaven to earth. Joseph received everything. The entire universe became a blessing to him. </p>
<p data-content-id="MtCll2XOY8R8dFgTUXdR5adc7Xob8JwNRjNJM9TIVoQfsRCA1WYTsZI35lh9oQ1PX"> Benjamin is described as a tearing wolf (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31326" data-verses="Genesis 49:27">49:27</span>, Heb.). Also, God’s dwelling place is with Benjamin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31327" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:12">Deut. 33:12</span>). Thus, Jacob’s prophecy with blessing ends with the fullness of the universal blessing and with God’s dwelling place. The end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31328" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> requires <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31329" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span> for its complete development. </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="Vyv6cezndY8yrw_ApV0zOeE67F7SJbjcYWxSSt0SaXZR8SPfWLyu4As---ucS3eoN">(13) Concerning Joseph</h2><h2 class="head7" data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8AfonzthcnauNKoc1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq">(a) A Son of a Fruitful Tree by a Fountain</h2>
<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi7vWf5kN1WapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31330" data-verses="Genesis 49:22">Genesis 49:22</span> says, “A son of a fruitful tree is Joseph, a son of a fruitful tree by a fountain; whose branches run over the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1334" id="1334">[1334]</span> wall” (Heb.). Firstly, Joseph is a son of a fruitful tree. This son is, of course, the bough of a tree. If Joseph is the bough, the son, then the fruitful tree must be Jacob. According to the record of the Bible, no one prior to Jacob had twelve sons. (Twelve is the number of eternal completion.) The fact that Jacob had twelve sons means that he was very fruitful. Jacob was the son of Isaac, and Isaac was the son of Abraham, the father of the called race. In the Bible God is called the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31331" data-verses="Exodus 3:6">Exo. 3:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31332" data-verses="Matthew 22:32">Matt. 22:32</span>). This title is also the title of the Triune God. The God of Abraham refers to God the Father, the God of Isaac refers to God the Son, and the God of Jacob refers to God the Spirit. As we have pointed out, we should not consider Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as three persons, but as three aspects of one person. In like manner, the three of the Triune God are three in one. Jacob signifies the coming of the Spirit, the third of the Triune God. The Father was in the Son, and the Son became the Spirit. Thus, the Spirit is the issue of our God. </p>
<p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWiy9y4trQfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> If we touch the spirit of the Bible, we shall see that, as a fruitful person, Jacob signifies the producing God. God is the fruitful tree. This is proved by the <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31333" data-verses="John 15:1">fifteenth chapter of John</span>, where Christ says that He is the vine tree. Christ as the embodiment of God is the producing tree. Christ truly is fruitful. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31334" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> we see a son of this tree. The Son of God is the branching out of God. For this reason, in the Old Testament Christ is called the Branch (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31335" data-verses="Jeremiah 23:5">Jer. 23:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31336" data-verses="Zechariah 6:12">Zech. 6:12</span>). The Bible is deep, profound, and far beyond our understanding. On the one hand, the Bible says that Christ is a tree and, on the other hand, it says that He is the branch. Is He then the tree or the branch? He is both. As the embodiment of God, He is the tree, but as the branching out of God, He is the branch. Joseph, a type of Christ, was also the son of a fruitful tree, the branching out of God. Joseph was God’s branching out. As we all know, the branch of a tree is part of the tree. Thus, Joseph, the son of Jacob, was part of Jacob, the fruitful father. Speaking typically, Joseph was Christ as the Son of God who was the branching out of the fruitful God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1335" id="1335">[1335]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="yObOo7LOjjFarxWXeCIo5MQ8-X-nfP03Kiwq9oNdUXzgDgrb2yrYAyxlelIIkT9lp"> I became familiar with the history of Jacob’s twelve sons long before I realized how sweet and wonderful their history was. The more time I spend on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31363" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span>, the more I appreciate these twelve sons. It is very worthwhile to delve into their history. The first four sons—Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah—were all sinful. But Joseph and Benjamin, the last two, are without fault or defect. They are perfect. Between the first four sons and the last two, we have the other six sons. With Dan we see apostasy; with Gad, recovery; with Asher, sufficiency; and with Naphtali, resurrection. If you put together the record of these twelve sons according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31364" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span>, you will have a portrait of yourself. On the one hand, when I look at these twelve sons of Jacob, I marvel at them; on the other hand, I am thankful to God, because in them I see a picture of myself. I also see the very Christ I have experienced and the salvation and transformation that are in Christ. In the past we all were Reubens, Simeons, Levis, and Judahs, but today we are Josephs and Benjamins. </p>
<p data-content-id="8UouUokiSDmfQ5btvmO_v9CRcxyULW5y_xM7y0Cjh31lO6uhzd5IR1LXaUCBwG1Zr"> Two of the sinful ones, Levi and Judah, were transferred into something positive. Levi was transferred into the priesthood, and Judah was transferred into the kingship. Thus, among the twelve sons of Jacob, we eventually have the priesthood, the kingship, and finally the ultimate consummation, which we see in Joseph and Benjamin. In the following message we shall see that the ultimate consummation is of two things: blessing and dwelling. We shall be brought fully into the universal blessing under God, and then we shall become His dwelling. Sinners become God’s priests and kings, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1344" id="1344">[1344]</span> and ultimately they are under His universal blessing and become His eternal dwelling. If we saw the significance of this record, we would shout and praise the Lord. We would say, “Once I was a Reuben, but today I am a Levi, a Judah, a Joseph, and a Benjamin!” For eternity, we shall be the kings under God’s blessing, and we shall be God’s dwelling. </p>
<p data-content-id="0JV8hDILxxkbeRl9MfljJ49vqwfFVL0iYCHdxKUekJ14F8oFrW_U5yl_qzhcrk_AB"> Have you ever realized that the Bible could be so wonderful? Have you ever seen that in one chapter, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31365" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span>, we could have an abstract of the whole Bible and a summary of the history of the twelve sons of Jacob, of the history of the nation of Israel, of the history of the church, and of our own spiritual history? Everything is here. Although this chapter is poetic and very profound, it is nonetheless quite simple. It is all-inclusive. It includes all the Bible, it encompasses the history of the twelve tribes, it indicates the history of the church, and it portrays our personal history. How wonderful! Without doubt, this summarizes God’s dealing with His chosen people. God’s dealing with His people began with sinners, it proceeds to transformation, and eventually it reaches the ultimate consummation, which is the blessing and the dwelling of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYRqs4Vm4lMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx"> Among Jacob’s twelve sons, there are various types of persons. How I thank God for giving Jacob twelve sons. What if Jacob had had just one son? In the eyes of God, Abraham and Isaac each had just one son, for God counted only Isaac and Jacob, not Ishmael or Esau. But God’s economy required twelve tribes. For this, Jacob had to have twelve sons. Not even ten tribes would have been sufficient. One day, after the death of Solomon, the kingdom of Israel was divided into two parts with ten tribes in one part and two in the other. But not even these ten tribes were sufficient; there had to be twelve. We need to remember the names of Jacob’s twelve sons: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Zebulun, Issachar, Dan, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Joseph, and Benjamin. In this message we shall consider part of the spiritual significance of Joseph and Benjamin, covering three matters: fruitfulness, victory, and trust. In the following message we shall consider the blessing and the dwelling. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1345" id="1345">[1345]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_GoipEqDx8eNDUj_Re0PYgwzrXBsp6WC18ChDo1xwQtosUhgoOAwHTE11ycxnrRv6">I. FRUITFUL</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIJS_SGwDfD0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs">A. A Son of a Fruitful Tree</h2>
<p data-content-id="yObOo7LOjjFarxWXeCIo5MQ8-W6LfP03Kiwq9oNdUXzgDgrb2yrYAyxlelIIkT9lp"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31366" data-verses="Genesis 49:22">Genesis 49:22</span> says, “A son of a fruitful tree is Joseph, a son of a fruitful tree by a fountain; whose branches run over the wall” (Heb.). Joseph was very fruitful. He was fully occupied with fruitfulness, having no time for anything else. He had no time to argue with his brothers or to fight with others. People become occupied with negative things because they are not fully occupied with positive things. It is not profitable for a large number of saints to be gathered together and not be fully occupied. In such a case they will not be occupied with the positive things. Rather, spontaneously they will become occupied with negative things, just like the man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31367" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">Matthew 12</span> who was vacant and who became possessed with seven demons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31368" data-verses="Matthew 12:43-45">vv. 43-45</span>). That man was like a clean, unoccupied apartment. Many saints are clean, but they are empty, unoccupied. Therefore, negative things come in. The saints need to be occupied with positive things. Then they will have no capacity, time, or energy for things such as gossip. Gossiping proves that not all our energy is being used. Joseph, however, was not an unoccupied person. As we shall see in later messages, from the time of his youth, he was occupied with positive things. He was occupied with his father’s will, his father’s mind, his father’s interest, and his father’s commission. Hence, there was no opportunity for the “gophers” or “dogs” to come in. If a room is filled with twenty people, no gopher would dare to come in. But if the room is unoccupied, gophers and dogs may try to come in. The best way to keep the saints from negative things is to fill them with positive things. Again I say that from his youth, Joseph was fully occupied with positive things, mainly with fruitfulness. </p>
<p data-content-id="8UouUokiSDmfQ5btvmO_v9CRcwG0LW5y_xM7y0Cjh31lO6uhzd5IR1LXaUCBwG1Zr"> When Joseph’s father and eleven brothers and their families came down to Egypt, they became the channels for the branching out of Joseph’s fruitfulness. At that time in Egypt Joseph was not simply branching out personally; he was branching out God’s administration with seventy people. Joseph was very fruitful. The entire world was under the branching out of Joseph. Joseph was a picture, a type. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="1346" id="1346">[1346]</span> means that the fulfillment must be with the church. The church people should be the most fruitful people. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31369" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts chapter two</span> reveals how fruitful Peter and the other eleven apostles were. Throughout the centuries, all who have loved the Lord and who have been occupied with Him have also been fruitful. </p>
<p data-content-id="0JV8hDILxxkbeRl9MfljJ49vqx7hVL0iYCHdxKUekJ14F8oFrW_U5yl_qzhcrk_AB"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31370" data-verses="Genesis 49:22">Verse 22</span> says that Joseph was a son of a fruitful tree. The word “son” here indicates a bough or a branch. Most versions translate the Hebrew word as “bough,” which is a large branch. This means that Joseph was a branch of a fruitful tree. In the entire universe there is just one fruitful tree, and that tree is Christ. As the branch of God, Christ is a fruitful tree. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31371" data-verses="Zechariah 6:12">Zechariah 6:12</span> says, “Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH.” This branch is Christ. Christ as the branch of God has branched out God to humanity, eventually becoming a tree. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31372" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>, a chapter on fruitfulness, the Lord Jesus said, “I am the true vine” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31373" data-verses="John 15:1">v. 1</span>). Christ is the vine tree. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31374" data-verses="John 15:5">John 15:5</span> the Lord said, “I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit.” As branches of such a fruitful tree, we all need to be fruitful. </p>
<p data-content-id="7QLYjNQiQVgXUmBebuoYRqs4VksdMvM6a45ARh8csXaemjyvoQkQAtOt5ry9yOImx"> Do not consider your weaknesses, failures, or the pitiful situation around you. Church history has two sides—a dark side and a glorious side. When we look at the glorious side, we see abundant fruitfulness. Not only Peter and Paul but all those who love the Lord have been fruitful. Sometimes we may say, “We are weak, our situation is not promising, the increase is coming slowly, and the number remains small.” But if you have the heavenly view, you will see that the church is very fruitful and that the history of the church is a history of fruitfulness. Again I say, do not look at the situation from the dark side, but from the glorious side. God is victorious, and the church is fruitful. The branch is branching out. Peter, Paul, and all the lovers of Christ throughout the centuries have had many branches. </p>

<p data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7XmrOekz93ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo"> Jacob’s prophecy regarding his twelve sons ends with a blessing that includes ten items. The history of these twelve sons begins with a sinner, that is, it begins with sin, even with a gross sin, not a refined sin. At the beginning we have a person who is full of sin, and at the end we have a person who receives the universal blessing. Thus, the prophecy ends with the full blessing. With Joseph, everything is a blessing, and the blessing is everywhere. There is blessing upon blessing. </p>
<p data-content-id="lxh4GxFrE6IS95e5yrdKRhiMn2UXCaMCKtZvgWpISkyPVgGJ8tirC6z0FK7A6tiDI"> The Bible is a wonderful book; no human mind can fully understand it. The more we study the Bible, the more we realize how little we really know it. The Bible is too profound. The ten blessings related to Joseph, for example, require the whole Bible for their development. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="O2yuDG7PN2fH6Bl3BgtCmCns802jEpRIDCG7E2IvH3ZYhF3X-nhUJokbXtepQnZnB">IV. BLESSED</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="4ih-7ivO1f_Uex_xN1d2yId1dL-VCD7MrPWGnia394uU8LdMUmJUsII4OLzctGMcQ">A. With the Precious Things of Heaven</h2>
<p data-content-id="oojwSJGvLbmiYj5tIQGorZwMH7L44PdhX0jmIOM9tm0WtyG5HMI5sjMdIyAZ1hq_3"> First are the blessings with the precious things of heaven above (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31402" data-verses="Genesis 49:25">49:25</span>). The precious things of heaven above certainly include rain and snow. These precious things must also include the angels, for the angels certainly are a blessing to us. They are our servants and even camp around us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31403" data-verses="Hebrews 1:13-14">Heb. 1:13-14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31404" data-verses="Psalms 34:7">Psa. 34:7</span>). Every believer has at least one angel. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31405" data-verses="Acts 12:1">Acts 12</span> speaks of Peter’s angel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31406" data-verses="Acts 12:15">v. 15</span>), and in the Gospel of Matthew the Lord Jesus indicates that we have angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31407" data-verses="Matthew 18:10">18:10</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LnYU2aAXirZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> The material things in the Old Testament are shadows of the reality in the New Testament. In the New Testament the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1358" id="1358">[1358]</span> blessings are spiritual blessings. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31408" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span> says, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.” In this verse we have the words blessed and blessing. We are blessed with all spiritual blessings in the heavenlies. The word “places” is not found in the original text. It is difficult to say what the words “the heavenlies” definitely refer to. Certainly this includes the heavenly nature, the heavenly position, the heavenly condition, the heavenly situation, the heavenly atmosphere, and the heavenly capacity. The spiritual blessings are of a heavenly nature, in a heavenly situation and atmosphere, and under a heavenly condition. In other words, every aspect of these spiritual blessings is heavenly. Today we are enjoying these heavenly blessings. According to the New Testament reality and fulfillment, the precious things of heaven above are the blessings in the heavenlies. </p>
<p data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtrIG8iLrv_u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31409" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians chapter one</span> reveals that one of these heavenly blessings is God’s selection. God did not select us on earth, but in the heavens. Thus, our selection is heavenly, with the heavenly nature, under a heavenly condition, and in a heavenly atmosphere. A second spiritual blessing is predestination. Predestination is nothing earthly; rather it is heavenly. After God selected us, He predestinated us, marked us out, in the heavenlies. This marking out is heavenly in nature, in atmosphere, and in condition. Although the worldly people know nothing of the heavenly blessings, we are enjoying them, for we have been selected and predestinated by God from heaven. We all have been marked out, and wherever we go we bear this heavenly mark. This mark was made in the heavenlies before the foundation of the world. Therefore, it is not anything earthly, but heavenly. The adoption to be the sons of God is another heavenly blessing mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31410" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span>. Redemption and forgiveness are also included among these heavenly blessings. Although we are on earth, we are nonetheless enjoying the heavenly redemption and the heavenly forgiveness. The One who redeemed us and who has forgiven us is the very God in heaven. Our redemption and forgiveness come from the heavens. Besides all these, in <span class="pg" data-page-id="1359" id="1359">[1359]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31411" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span> there are also other items listed among the spiritual blessings. </p>
<p data-content-id="6CXs4WE0BL6-B1B4FDiAErJUue3XzGKjTYJeRnGmeXBe72gXmUfpgBoC9qhDjO81n"> The heavenly rain and snow also come down upon us. There are many who do not like snow. However, those who live where there is snow are often healthier than those who live in a warm climate. Whether we like it or not, in our spiritual life our heavenly Father sometimes sends snow upon us. It is healthy to be outside in the snow; it is a marvelous enjoyment as well. Rain is good, and snow is enjoyable. These are some of the precious things of heaven above. We need to constantly remind ourselves that we are under God’s blessing of the precious things of heaven. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="R_GfdTPWaEiXNNW82-yDbXFjDhuiLG6UWYb4K416h7Rart6vExDqqOyU38XwPBejO">B. With the Dew</h2><p data-content-id="sHB9QAVlSM3v0XjManno_mAkrmHHfHA5fTkqfQSTHo75EQs1z1Iu7LXCJgPqSPnNs"> Joseph was also blessed with the dew (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31412" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:13">Deut. 33:13</span>). Dew is a finer blessing than either rain or snow. The Bible uses dew to describe God’s merciful favor (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31413" data-verses="Lamentations 3:22-23">Lam. 3:22-23</span>). This indicates that something from the heavens is always descending upon us. This something is not very strong and bold; it is fine and gentle, seeming to come quietly, a little at a time. This is the dew. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31414" data-verses="Psalms 133:1">Psalm 133</span> says that the blessing upon the unity of the brothers is like the dew of Hermon that descends upon the mountains of Zion. Mount Hermon, to the north of Mount Zion, is much higher than Mount Zion. The dew of Hermon must descend upon Zion by means of a strong north wind. The dew comes from the north. Do not think that only the snow comes from the north, for dew also comes from that direction. Sometimes the Father sends us the rain and at other times He sends the snow, but more often He sends the dew. Every morning the Lord’s mercy is like the dew. This is the reason we must keep morning watch. If you do not attend morning watch, you will miss the dew. After the sun rises, the dew will disappear. If you would enjoy the dew, you must rise up early in the morning. This dew is not as cold, sharp, or troublesome as the snow. It comes from the heavens by the blowing of the north wind. But when it comes, it comes gently and quietly, a little at a time. If you consider your experience, you will realize that you have had some experience of the dew. This dew <span class="pg" data-page-id="1360" id="1360">[1360]</span> that comes upon us waters us a little at a time. How gentle and fine it is! </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XR7pXdprYw1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW">C. With the Deep, the Springs, Lying Beneath</h2><p data-content-id="LD01-v3um3NuLShGttlVjq2KnW7cRg9jsTHcyuTXlEDKbBHncuqREEkOSwGaFv9xn"> Both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31415" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31416" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:1">Deuteronomy 33</span> say that Joseph was blessed “with the deep that lieth beneath” (Heb.). This must refer to the deep springs underneath the earth. The blessings upon Joseph begin with heaven above, proceed to the snow and the dew in the air, and then go on to the springs in the earth. By the mention of the dew and the deep, the springs, we realize that the precious things of heaven above should no doubt refer to rain and snow. According to the New Testament, the real spring is not underneath the earth; it is within us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31417" data-verses="John 4:14">John 4:14</span> says, “But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.” We have a spring of divine life welling up from within us. What a blessing! Therefore, we are constantly receiving and enjoying the blessings that come from above, from within, and from the air. Some of the blessings from above are like rain and snow, some of the blessings from within are like springs, and some of the blessings in the air are like the dew. We Christians, today’s Josephs, are fully under these blessings. </p>

<p data-content-id="DO3iI8hndhPJegjLgDvv3yiSOZ0hY_rzh5_DwZgnXV3ld5fNdrMa9OC4w5JOw_9df"> As we have pointed out a number of times, the record of Jacob’s blessing found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31433" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> begins with a sinner and ends with the universal blessing and the eternal dwelling. If we have a proper knowledge of the Bible, we shall see that the entire Bible issues in the universal blessing of God and in His eternal dwelling. For eternity, we shall be under the universal blessing to be God’s eternal dwelling. This is the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem. The new heaven and new earth will be a realm of universal blessing. We shall be under this blessing in order that we may be the New Jerusalem. According to the picture in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31434" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span>, in the environment of the new heaven and new earth there is nothing but blessing, blessing upon blessing. Everything in that environment will be a blessing to the New Jerusalem, God’s eternal dwelling. We, God’s chosen people, shall be that dwelling within and under the universal blessing. This is the ultimate consummation of the revelation of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ss-Kv9Ptsxb3Hpm3OLvQXTAO3Xg5kwLJkPM-9Yo5gpNrugTwkZhE_qWQlLbkcq0fN"> It is very interesting to see that the short record of Jacob’s prophetic blessing issues in the same conclusion as does the entire Bible. Although there is no sin in the first two chapters of Genesis, sin enters the scene in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31435" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">chapter three</span>. The sinner in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31436" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis chapter three</span> was a real Reuben. However, in the last two chapters of the Bible, there will be the real Joseph and Benjamin. We may say that Joseph is the sign of the universal blessing. All the blessings are upon the head of the one who was separate from his brothers. Benjamin is the symbol of God’s eternal dwelling. Hallelujah, the church in the Lord’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="1370" id="1370">[1370]</span> recovery today is a miniature of the universal blessing and the eternal dwelling! In the churches we have blessing upon blessing. Under such a blessing, we are the dwelling of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUDsBBjBPjRtaf2PAgd0QI2KJm6RKXdsQrQ3vEcVWKTvzkKR8PehPPTdnoCg5OrXo"> These two matters, blessing and dwelling, are found in the New Testament Epistles. Probably not many Christians have paid attention to these matters in the Epistles. But these two words provide the outline of the Epistles, for all the Epistles are on God’s blessing. Take Ephesians as a representative illustration. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31437" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span> says, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.” Here we have the matter of the blessings. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31438" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span> speaks of the Body, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31439" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">Ephesians 2:22</span> speaks of the habitation, both of which are symbols of God’s dwelling. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31440" data-verses="Ephesians 3:16-17">Ephesians 3:16 and 17</span> the Apostle Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen us through His Spirit into the inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts. Hence, in the short book of Ephesians, both the blessings and the dwelling are covered. God has blessed us with all the spiritual blessings in the heavenlies for the purpose that we might become His dwelling. </p>
<p data-content-id="e4Tu7RSEEn956Bu43KIdEstNelQZLhbqE99G8qhMhliWdoAMPEcx2IgxrawDytCgr"> If you would ask me to say what the Epistles reveal, I would say that they reveal the matters of blessing and dwelling. To see this, however, we need light and vision. Without light and vision, we may read the Epistles again and again and see only things such as the charge for wives to submit to their husbands and for husbands to love their wives, to redeem the time, to be diligent, and to love our neighbors. If we view the Epistles with our natural sight, without the light and the vision, we shall mainly see these minor points and miss the blessing and the dwelling in the Epistles. The New Testament is concerned with the matters of blessing and dwelling. </p>
<p data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_KVPWUMF0w3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj"> So many excellent and wonderful points are covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31441" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span>. How I thank the Lord that Jacob’s first son was Reuben and that the last two were Joseph and Benjamin! If Joseph and Benjamin had been the first two and Reuben the last, everything would have been upside down. Praise the Lord that once we were Reubens, but today we are Josephs <span class="pg" data-page-id="1371" id="1371">[1371]</span> and Benjamins! I can testify that I am today’s Joseph and Benjamin. Day and night, I am under God’s blessing, and I am God’s dwelling place. Even the young people, those in junior high and high school, must be Josephs and Benjamins. Before we came into the church, we never realized the significance of Joseph and Benjamin. But if we in the Lord’s recovery are not Josephs and Benjamins, then who is? Are you not a Joseph and a Benjamin? Are you not under God’s universal blessing, and are you not God’s eternal dwelling? As today’s Benjamin, God dwells in me, and not only in me, but between my shoulders. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="r7Hx3PN1UvYcekg0VIHw3MhCInS9iDRS_uddY2xcadSWbdKQLTIgitGFDKxWMnxPb">I. With the Blessings of the Breasts and the Womb</h2><p data-content-id="dPoL9UMxyJ6FDpPspwfNRciBHrozFpASr4TkYTzshCPHAeh0aQZgdg4iAS6BY8W2B"> In the previous message we covered the first eight aspects of the universal blessing. In his blessing of Joseph, Jacob used many poetic expressions, such as ancient mountains, eternal hills, and the utmost bound of the eternal hills. These particular expressions indicate time and space, all time from the ancient times to eternity and all space from heaven to under the earth. Hence, these poetic expressions refer to the universal blessing, for time plus space equals the universe. We have a blessing that fills the entire universe. Throughout time and space, we are under this blessing. God’s blessing fills the universe, from eternity past to eternity future and from the heavens above to the depths underneath the earth. Everywhere and at every time there is nothing but blessing. Oh, we all must see this vision and have this realization! There is no need to wait for the coming of the new heaven and the new earth, for in the church life today we are in the foretaste of this universal blessing. </p>
<p data-content-id="QMSNPOcCBLw6v-EOydvwZFVpIvozduX4YH5_O01lRUzkJdbjHu_x8PZ2HwO74uIjb"> Although the first eight items of the blessing bestowed upon Joseph are universal, they are rather common. If you examine them, you will see that nothing of life is involved; neither is there anything of dwelling. Hence, we need to consider the last two items, one of which involves life and the other, dwelling. Remember, the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31442" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> is poetic and poetry often uses symbols. One picture or symbol can take the place of a thousand words. Under the inspiration of <span class="pg" data-page-id="1372" id="1372">[1372]</span> God, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31443" data-verses="Genesis 49:25">49:25</span> Jacob spoke of “blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.” In this poetic utterance, the womb signifies the producing of life, the begetting of life, and the breasts signify the nourishment of life. In His creation, God only blessed the living creatures and man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31444" data-verses="Genesis 1:22">1:22</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31445" data-verses="Genesis 1:28">28</span>). He did not bless His work accomplished on the first four days. He did not bless the sun, the moon, the stars, or the vegetation on the earth. But on the fifth day God blessed the living creatures in the waters and the fowl in the air, and on the sixth day He blessed man. Thus, among all the works of His creation, God blessed only the living creatures and man. This impresses us with the fact that God is for life. God’s intention is to have the producing life. The fact that Joseph was blessed with the blessings of the womb and of the breasts indicates that he was blessed with the begetting and nourishing life. These figures should not be applied to the animal life, nor even to the human life, but to the eternal life. The eternal life is the highest life, the most productive life. In the New Testament we see that the producing life is not the animal life nor the human life, but the eternal life. Today we in the church are experiencing the eternal life as the producing life. The many items of blessing in the church include the breasts and the womb, the producing and nourishing life. </p>

These blessings are given in figures, signs, and symbols, all of which need to be allegorized. We have seen that in Genesis the seeds of nearly all the truths in the Bible are sown. The seeds sown in this book are developed in the following books and are harvested in the book of Revelation. Because Genesis is a book of the seeds of the truths contained in the Bible, the conclusion of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31478" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span> must correspond to the conclusion of the whole Bible. In the last two chapters of Revelation there are two main things: the universal blessing and the eternal dwelling of God with men. </p>
<p data-content-id="Vyv6cezndY8yrw_ApV0zOeEK7E_2JbjcYWxSSt0SaXZR8SPfWLyu4As---ucS3eoN"> Before we consider this universal blessing and the eternal dwelling, we need to review <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31479" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span>. The first four sons of Jacob were Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah. According to the record of the Old Testament, these four sons were evil. The first and the fourth, Reuben and Judah, were full of lust. The second and the third, Simeon and Levi, were full of anger. Lust and anger characterize evil people. In the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens decreed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31480" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">Matthew chapters five</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31481" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">six</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31482" data-verses="Matthew 7:1">seven</span>, the Lord Jesus covered lust and anger in a strong way. If a man can be kept from these two things, he will not be sinful. A man becomes sinful mostly because he is full of lust and anger. We praise the Lord that in His grace He saved the first four sons of Jacob. Moreover, two of them were transformed into something marvelous. Levi was transformed to become the priests, and Judah was transformed to become the kings. Sinners have become priests and kings. This has been accomplished by a kingly salvation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1382" id="1382">[1382]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="iUV4XKoyNif_P8AfonzthcnquM-Qc1NdPFrmfdmtrTVS3VwerpakNeAEUwz_G-Gxq"> This salvation was sent out to the Gentile world by Zebulun, the fifth son of Jacob. After the gospel was shipped out by Zebulun, Issachar came in as rest, rest in the gospel accomplished by Judah and preached by Zebulun. The saved one rests in God’s salvation. After Issachar came Dan and with him a form of apostasy. Although Dan deviated from God’s way, Gad came in to restore the situation. Thus, with Dan we have apostasy, and with Gad we have recovery. The recovery with Gad issues in the sufficiency of the riches of Christ symbolized by Asher. Naphtali, who follows Asher, signifies resurrection in which are the riches of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi7vWv5lpJWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ"> After the first ten sons, we come to the last two, Joseph and Benjamin. If you read the record of these two sons carefully, you will see that there is no account of any defect or failure in them. Although there is a long record regarding Joseph in the Bible, there is no hint that he was wrong in anything or that he failed. Joseph was perfect. Although we cannot say that Benjamin was perfect, there is no record of any defect in his life either. Joseph was called the son of a fruitful tree, and Benjamin, the son at the right hand. It is very meaningful that Joseph was fruitful and that Benjamin was at the right hand of God. Both are in resurrection. These two characteristics can easily be applied to the Lord Jesus Christ. Christ is the only Son of the fruitful tree, and He is also the only Son at the right hand of God. Hence, both Joseph and Benjamin were types of Christ. Joseph was a type of Christ issuing in God’s unlimited, boundless, universal blessing. The perfect Christ typified by Joseph brought in God’s boundless blessing. Benjamin was a type of Christ as the One who brought in God’s eternal dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWiy9C4v_gfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31483" data-verses="Genesis 49:22-26">Genesis 49:22-26</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31484" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:13-16">Deuteronomy 33:13-16</span> indicate that the blessing upon Joseph is universal and eternal. It is from the ancient mountains to the eternal hills. This indicates space and time. The blessing that Christ has brought in fills every part of the universe. When the new heaven and the new earth come, there will be nothing but blessing in the whole universe. There will be blessing upon blessing. This is the life of Joseph, the life that issues in blessing. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1383" id="1383">[1383]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXlUvZgPS0wrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip"> The record concerning Benjamin in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31485" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31486" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:1">Deuteronomy 33</span> is very short. But this short record gives us a clear picture of Benjamin’s life. His life issues in the dwelling of God. Eventually, this dwelling becomes God’s eternal dwelling. In the record of Joseph and Benjamin we find a strong indication of what the desire of God’s heart is. In his word concerning Joseph, Moses spoke about “the good will of him that dwelt in the bush” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31487" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:16">Deut. 33:16</span>). When God called Moses, Moses saw a burning bush. Out of that burning bush God spoke to him. Moses later came to realize that the God who dwelt in the bush desired to have a dwelling place on earth. This was the reason He called the children of Israel out of Egypt, led them into the wilderness, and charged them to build Him a tabernacle. When God called Moses, He spoke to him out of the bush. But after the tabernacle was built, God spoke out of the tabernacle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31488" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Lev. 1:1</span>). This reveals that God’s intention was to have a dwelling place with man on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROnLTVTljeOlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31489" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:12">Deuteronomy 33:12</span> says, “And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.” This verse says that God will dwell between Benjamin’s shoulders and that Benjamin will dwell in safety by the Lord. In other words, Benjamin will be the next-door neighbor of the Lord. Many think that Jerusalem was in Judah, but it was actually in Benjamin. Although the king came from Judah, the capital was in Benjamin. Jerusalem, the capital, was the dwelling place of God. Geographically speaking, it was located between Benjamin’s shoulders. Because the Lord made His home there and Benjamin lived in the Lord’s neighborhood, Benjamin dwelt in safety. </p>
<p data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9AnLthLAG6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr"> The concept of blessing and dwelling is very strong in Jacob’s prophetic blessing of his twelve sons. These two matters issue in the universal blessing and the eternal dwelling. As we have pointed out, the ultimate consummation of the Bible is precisely these two things. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31490" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis chapter three</span>, man became a sinner. Out from among all the sinners, a good number have been saved. Many of the saved ones have been transformed into priests and kings. The kingly salvation has been preached as the gospel of the kingdom, and the saved <span class="pg" data-page-id="1384" id="1384">[1384]</span> ones have come to rest in this gospel. After the apostasy and the restoration, we have the issue of the riches in resurrection life. Therefore, all that is covered in the Bible is represented by Jacob’s prophetic blessing. </p>
<p data-content-id="FyrUURSenH7AUUlr0ndgduMgHmHevlth22OadvBKOnc_QUvWSaFJlMIPAfMT2Bdu2"> Both in the Bible and in history there have been many Reubens, Simeons, Levis, and Judahs. Moreover, many saved ones have been transformed into priests and kings. Out of the kingship has come a salvation preached as a kingly salvation. The saved ones, as symbolized by Issachar, rest in this salvation. But Dan, the fall into apostasy, has come in. Following the apostasy, there is the recovery, the restoration, with Gad, which issues in the riches of Asher and in the resurrection of Naphtali. Eventually, Joseph and Benjamin appear, both of whom typify Christ. This is a general sketch of the Bible. This sketch, however, is rather doctrinal; hence we need to come now to the matter of experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="CAIiqFyjjgw0LbNxWLi5C94_-w2icXq_WajUO0fMiI1qsIetqtq6bkTvknnO7bFYb"> We were Reubens and Simeons who have been saved and transformed into Levis and Judahs. In the church life today we are priests and kings. However, Dan, the apostate church, has come in. But following Dan came Gad signifying the recovery, which issues in the sufficiency of Asher. Asher is in Naphtali, in resurrection. All this results in Joseph and Benjamin. Therefore, today we are not Reubens and Simeons, but Levis, Judahs, Josephs, and Benjamins. From my conscience, I can testify that I used to be a Reuben and a Simeon full of lust and anger. But through the years I have been transformed into a Levi, a priest, and into a Judah, a king. Furthermore, I have been transformed into a Joseph, one full of blessing, and into a Benjamin, one who has become God’s dwelling place. How about you? Are you a Joseph and a Benjamin? </p>

<p data-content-id="m-8njJPAImMbkcMAclhD1X-90DvfiWYATK_PQGzlNnXgplQTOgX_WJOcvDvUiARQP"> Genesis is a long book, composed of fifty chapters. The record of Jacob’s life occupies more than half of this book, about twenty-five and a half chapters. In past messages we have seen how Jacob was born, how he had been selected by God before his birth, and how he was striving, even when he was still in his mother’s womb. He continued his striving throughout most of his life. Jacob lived to be one hundred forty-seven years old. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31511" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">Genesis 49</span> we read of Jacob’s departure from this life. The quality of a man’s life and the outcome of his life are determined primarily by the last stage of his life, not by the first stage. It can be compared to runners in a race. It does not mean much that you run well at the beginning of the race. The final result is what counts. In this message we come to the final stage of the life of this wonderful person, Jacob. We need to see how he behaved himself at the time of his departure. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROnLTRTn32OlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX"> In the Bible, the best departure from this life besides that of the Lord Jesus was the Apostle Paul. When Paul was about to depart, he declared, “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; henceforth, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me in that day” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31512" data-verses="2Timothy 4:7-8">2 Tim. 4:7-8</span>). What an excellent departure this was! I hope that we all shall be able to make such a declaration at the end of our race. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1394" id="1394">[1394]</span> Although the departure of the Apostle Paul was most excellent, I still love the departure of Jacob, for his departure was lovely and pleasant. Paul’s departure was simple. He had no wife and no children. At the time of his departure, he was alone in prison, and there were not many complications. With Jacob, however, there were a great many involvements. </p>
<p data-content-id="AJUSZJXLTd3isVO6EJz9AnLphJEq6ofUZtxwoiW5PIU3bTTVHOXFA_eYPIKL6X3Mr"> Due to God’s ordination and due to his own striving, Jacob became involved with various matters and people. For example, Jacob had four wives: Leah, Rachel, and the two maids. Although his heart was to have Rachel, he was cheated by Laban, who gave him Leah instead. Of course, Rachel was also given to him. In actuality, who was Jacob’s genuine wife—Rachel or Leah? According to the record of Genesis, Jacob treated both Leah and Rachel as his genuine wife. He buried Leah in the cave of Machpelah where Abraham and Sarah, and Isaac and Rebekah were buried. By burying Leah in the cave of Machpelah, where the genuine wives of the fathers were buried, Jacob indicated that he recognized her as his real wife. Later, however, as he was departing, he made a sovereign arrangement for Rachel. By doing this, he was telling his descendants that he considered Rachel his real wife. Jacob’s life was so involved that it is difficult to determine who his real wife was. </p>
<p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQapUVrmRUHTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> Jacob’s four wives gave birth to twelve sons, each of whom was in a category of his own. If there had not been so many categories among Jacob’s sons, it would have been impossible for the history of Israel, the history of the church, and even our own personal history to be represented by them. In the prophetic blessing pronounced upon Jacob’s twelve sons in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31513" data-verses="Genesis 49:1">chapter forty-nine</span>, we see a representation of the history of Israel, the history of the church, and of our personal history. In order to have such an all-inclusive picture, there was the need of an intricate involvement. Throughout his life, Jacob became involved not only with his wives and sons, but also with various geographical regions. He was born in the good land, but he journeyed to Padan-aram, and later returned to the good land. During the years of his retirement, he moved to Egypt with his family. Each of these moves produced more involvements. Jacob became involved even with Pharaoh, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1395" id="1395">[1395]</span> most powerful person on earth at the time. Jacob had involvement upon involvement, including involvements with the Arameans and the Egyptians. This involvement is also seen in his burial in the good land. The Canaanites thought that it was an Egyptian funeral when it actually was a Hebrew one. A company of Egyptian horsemen and chariots attended the burial of a Hebrew gentlemen. Besides all this, Jacob was involved with God. What involvements Jacob had! If we put together all the portions of the Word that speak of Jacob’s involvements, we shall rejoice before the Lord and say, “Praise the Lord! Hallelujah for the Lord’s rich word!” </p>
<p data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYhwp8seQW5oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa"> In spite of Jacob’s manifold involvement, he departed from this life in an excellent manner. His departure was not only triumphant; it was also pleasant and excellent. No one wants to face death. It is always a sad thing for someone to die. Nevertheless, I am fond of the record of Jacob’s departure. In this record we do not have a morbid picture, but a very pleasant painting. After reading this message, I believe that many will be convinced that, in certain respects, Jacob’s departure was more inspiring than that of the Apostle Paul. More than three chapters are given to the account of Jacob’s departure, but only a few verses are given to Paul’s. Let us now consider the details of Jacob’s departure, one by one. </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="cPulZmW9Wom935zP-Ax0YLTxYoSconn4eB2OQ7ou8EhkG1DtWPpKpkLpqWzcMA1UF">(1) Asking Joseph to Put His Hand under His Thigh</h2><p data-content-id="YWQf39oOaKT-w18LKhlsiptkn8kIDjHh52RJBmzJk0PH2LSkAzFUEZelzC01-ioTH"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31514" data-verses="Genesis 47:29">Genesis 47:29</span> says, “And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh.” This matter of having Joseph place his hand under Jacob’s thigh has been a problem to many Bible students. Jacob did not say to Joseph, “Do your best to get a physician to heal me.” Rather, he asked him to place his hand under his thigh. What is the significance of this? No doubt, it means to swear. But why did Jacob not have Joseph raise his hand if the significance of this act were only that of taking an oath? Instead of guessing, we should understand the Bible according to the facts contained in it. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we can trace what happened to Jacob’s thigh during his lifetime. On the eighth day after he was born, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1396" id="1396">[1396]</span> Jacob was circumcised in a part of his body close to his thigh. Then after Jacob had been striving for more than ninety-five years, God came in to touch his thigh. Thus, Jacob experienced both circumcision and a divine touch. First, something was cut off from a place very close to his thigh. That was circumcision. Years later, Jacob experienced a divine touch that caused him to walk with a limp. If you look deeply into the significance of these two things, you will see that both have the same meaning. To be circumcised is to have our flesh, our natural life, cut off. Jacob had been chosen to inherit God’s covenant. But his flesh, his natural life, was not useful for this. Rather, it was a hindrance. </p>
<p data-content-id="E-xv1nlZl2LrnNkDtbmzPfoWduSCtUIFb3C0mvDz1LtjokSWkphwKc-Ng-yoBiibt"> Consider the case of Abraham. God’s covenant was made with Abraham in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31515" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">Genesis 15</span>. Abraham, however, used his natural strength with Hagar to fulfill God’s promise. God was offended by this and stayed away from Abraham for thirteen years. Thirteen years later, God came back to Abraham and seemed to say, “Abraham, I am the all-sufficient One. I will keep My promise. Because I have promised to do something for you, I don’t need you to use your natural strength to fulfill what I have promised. What you did with Hagar greatly offended Me. For that reason, I have stayed away from you for these thirteen years. Now I have come to tell you that in My presence you must cut off your natural strength.” From that day onward, God’s covenant of grace became the covenant of circumcision. The covenant of circumcision means that the covenant of grace cannot be fulfilled or inherited through man’s natural strength. If we would inherit God’s promise of grace, our natural strength must be circumcised. On God’s side, this covenant is a covenant of grace. But on man’s side, it has become the covenant of circumcision. God still intends to give grace to man. However, in order to receive God’s covenanted grace, we must have our natural strength cut off. </p>

<p data-content-id="vGPkFtfe7Aen3iGIVhF4Ccmnr5BhJoSKHjShQRi-Q6TFheMiOa11sXw6WrcmFYS61"> Genesis is a wonderful book. The more we study it, the more we realize that no human hand could have written it. Apparently Genesis is simply a book of stories; however, when we probe into the depths of this book through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we find that it contains something profound related to our experience of life. If we read superficially, we shall not be able to understand why the events of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31543" data-verses="Genesis 38:1">chapter thirty-eight</span> are put after those of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31544" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span>. Not until we discover the spiritual significance of these chapters can we appreciate the deep meaning of their sequence. </p>
<p data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3OgkfH2Y8rDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12"> According to the record of the book of Genesis and according to our spiritual experience, Joseph should not be considered a person separate from Jacob, but rather as an aspect of Jacob’s biography. When we first came to Abraham in this life-study, we pointed out that, in spiritual experience, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not three separate individuals. Instead, they represent three aspects of the experience of one saint. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob represent three aspects of one spiritual man, and their biographies portray different aspects of the complete life of a saint. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are three aspects of one person, somewhat like the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the three of the Godhead. In the record of Genesis, God revealed Himself as the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. But the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is not three separate Gods; He is one Triune God. In a similar way, spiritually speaking, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not three separate persons, but three aspects of one <span class="pg" data-page-id="1406" id="1406">[1406]</span> complete person. Therefore, we have not only the Triune God, but also a complete man of three aspects. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PRI176eypG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> It is difficult to determine whether Abraham or Jacob comes first. According to the historical record, Abraham was the grandfather, and Jacob was the grandson. According to spiritual experience, however, Jacob must come first. Jacob was chosen before he was born (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31545" data-verses="Romans 9:11-13">Rom. 9:11-13</span>). This means that the complete saint was chosen as Jacob before birth. The book of Ephesians reveals that this selection took place before the foundation of the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31546" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4">Eph. 1:4</span>). Thus, the complete person was chosen as Jacob. He was also fallen as Jacob. Then this chosen and fallen one was called as Abraham. With Abraham, he not only was called, but also was justified and lived a life by faith. Furthermore, he inherited and enjoyed all the riches of Christ as Isaac. After he had been called and justified, and while he was living a life by faith, he inherited all the riches of Christ and enjoyed them. But this is not all. As Jacob, he also struggled and suffered because of his strivings. Moreover, he was dealt with and became matured. All this is the experience of Jacob. For all these experiences—the choosing, the fall, the calling, the justification by faith, the living by faith, the inheritance and enjoyment of the riches in Christ, the self-struggling, the sufferings, the dealings, and the maturity—there is the need of three persons, the need of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. </p>
<p data-content-id="uMdoZ7sIrphDxIxrKnqKmfONCPpqZxYYQWIgd4x9rSnaU9KtTeicgVo8QagD4QHNt"> These three represent you and me. We are chosen and fallen as Jacob. We are called, we are justified by faith, and we live by faith as Abraham. We inherit the riches of Christ and enjoy them as Isaac. We struggle, suffer, are dealt with, and mature as Jacob. When Jacob was matured, his name was changed. Not only was his disposition transformed, but his name was changed from Jacob, a supplanter, to Israel, a matured prince of God, one who could reign for God. </p>
<h2 class="head5" data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnnWdgK4svQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM">3) The Reigning Aspect of the Matured Israel</h2><p data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3OgkfH2ZIDDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12"> The matured Israel has a reigning aspect. We have seen the process of Jacob’s maturity and the manifestation of his maturity. His maturity was fully manifested in his excellent departure from this life. Now we must see the reigning aspect <span class="pg" data-page-id="1407" id="1407">[1407]</span> of this matured life. Therefore, in this message we come to the reigning aspect of the matured Israel, an aspect fully portrayed in the biography of Joseph. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PRI176fWFG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> Because Joseph represents an aspect of Jacob, we should not consider Joseph a person separate from Jacob. This is the reason the last fourteen chapters of Genesis combine the record of Joseph’s life with the record of Jacob’s. Genesis blends the biographies of Joseph and Jacob because they are actually the biography not of two persons, but of one. This blending of the record indicates that Joseph is an aspect of Jacob. If you read the record in Genesis from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31547" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span> through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31548" data-verses="Genesis 50:1">chapter fifty</span>, you will see that Joseph is an aspect, a part, of Jacob. He was Jacob’s expression. Wherever Joseph was, Jacob was there also. When Joseph was in power, it was actually Jacob who was reigning. Hence, their biographies are blended together as the biography of one person. </p>
<p data-content-id="uMdoZ7sIrphDxIxrKnqKmfONCN9KZxYYQWIgd4x9rSnaU9KtTeicgVo8QagD4QHNt"> For years I tried to divide each of the books of the Bible into sections. But when I came to the last chapters of the book of Genesis, I could not tell whether it was a section pertaining to Jacob or to Joseph. Eventually I gave up trying to divide this part of Genesis into sections. Because at that time I did not see the matter of life, I did not appreciate the excellence of the composition of Genesis. But we need to recognize that these chapters are part of one biography with two aspects. The day I saw this light I was very happy. Spiritually speaking, Joseph is not separate from Jacob. Rather, he represents the reigning aspect of a matured saint. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="f7zlWB8B4dO4Qg8ZBmMnnWdgK6oLQ0WFOOa8NdurMu9OBx84detuILWviZ5LRjWhM">a) Joseph’s Life—Being the Generation of Jacob</h2><p data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-yts0PmAKBVlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31549" data-verses="Genesis 37:2">Genesis 37:2</span> says, “These are the generations of Jacob.” Then it goes on to tell us of the life of Joseph. This proves that Joseph’s life was a part of Jacob’s generation. Joseph’s biography is an aspect of Jacob’s history. </p>
<h2 class="head6" data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXR0zZfoce443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP">b) Joseph Being a Type of Christ</h2><p data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkx_RSeNT-oPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU"> Joseph’s biography indicates that he had no defects. According to the record, he was altogether perfect. In the Bible Joseph is the perfect one in the Old Testament, and Jesus is <span class="pg" data-page-id="1408" id="1408">[1408]</span> the perfect One in the New Testament. The four biographies of Jesus in the New Testament reveal that He was perfect, without defect. The record of Joseph in the Old Testament reveals that he also was perfect. Some may say that in order to be a type of Christ, Joseph had to be perfect. But was not David a type of Christ? Certainly he was. But David, a type of Christ, committed gross sin. Solomon also was a type of Christ, but he too was sinful. With the exception of Joseph, all the personal types of Christ in the Old Testament had some shortcomings. </p>
<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j7PqRabif9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> As a type of Christ, Joseph signifies the reigning aspect of a matured saint, the mature Israel. Certainly the reigning aspect of such a person must be perfect. None of us, of course, is perfect. However, in our reigning aspect we are perfect. Whenever we are reigning in the spirit, we are perfect. Nevertheless, you may say, “I am not perfect. Rather, I am like Judah.” However, the aspect of you which is like Judah is not your reigning aspect, but your fallen aspect. Yes, according to your fallen aspect you are like Judah in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31550" data-verses="Genesis 38:1">chapter thirty-eight</span>. Both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31551" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapters thirty-seven</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31552" data-verses="Genesis 39:1">thirty-nine</span> are chapters of perfection. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31553" data-verses="Genesis 38:1">Chapter thirty-eight</span>, on the contrary, is a chapter of perversion. Thus, the reigning aspect is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31554" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span> and the fallen aspect in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31555" data-verses="Genesis 38:1">chapter thirty-eight</span>. Perhaps yesterday you were reigning for God, but today you may have committed sin, even a gross sin. This reveals the fact that we have various aspects. In this message we shall deal only with the reigning aspect. </p>
<p data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hiItMH8TJcGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD"> I hope that we all shall see that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph are one person. Joseph is not a separate aspect of a complete spiritual person as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are. Rather, as we have seen, Joseph is an aspect of Jacob. The Bible does not say that God is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, and the God of Joseph. This would make God quaternary instead of triune. There are only three. But when we come in Jacob to the stage of maturity, we see that with the mature life there is the reigning aspect. Neither Abraham nor Isaac reigned. But Joseph reigned representatively for Jacob. In other words, Jacob reigned through Joseph. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1409" id="1409">[1409]</span> </p>

These eight men are arranged in two groups of four. Adam, Abel, Enoch, and Noah make up the first group; and Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph form the second. The first group represents the created race, the Adamic race, whereas the second group represents the called race, the Abrahamic race. Because of the failure of the created race, God had a new start with the called race. The created race began with Adam and ended with Noah. At both the beginning and the ending, the created race was a failure. Adam, the head of God’s created race and its representative, became fallen. With Abel we have the coming back to God. In Adam, man fell away from God; but through God’s redemption, Abel came back to Him. Enoch, who came after Abel, not only returned to God, but also walked with God. The issue of his life was a type of the rapture. Enoch was raptured out of death unto God. Enoch’s life issued in Noah, who also walked with God and who had an experience of reigning, although his reigning was neither adequate nor full. However, Noah’s reigning issued in a fall. Noah’s descendants rebelled against God at Babel, and that rebellion resulted in God’s giving up of the created race. Forced to have a new beginning, God visited Abraham and called him out of the rebellious created race. This marked the beginning of a new race, the called race, the Abrahamic race. </p>
<p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1rdWdIw7JdzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> With this called race God certainly achieved a great success. Beginning with Abraham and continuing through Isaac <span class="pg" data-page-id="1422" id="1422">[1422]</span> and Jacob, the way rose higher and higher. Eventually we see a full reign in Jacob. As we have pointed out, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph should not be considered separate individuals. Rather, they represent four aspects of a complete, mature saint. In them we see God’s selection, God’s calling, and justification by faith. We see how a called and justified saint can live in the presence of God by faith to enjoy all the riches of the inheritance. However, such a one still strives to gain the birthright. But all his struggles cause him nothing but suffering. In his sufferings God’s hand comes upon him to deal with him, and he is dealt with by God until he becomes mature. Hallelujah, in the called race we see the maturity of life! This matured life has a reigning aspect, an aspect portrayed by the life of Joseph. This is the reason that in the book of Genesis Joseph is so excellent and marvelous. </p>
<p data-content-id="aGZQhn44RfDLbiYsGGvVFSYsVqaHKCGvuVmdAiPygWOGRgcCG0VL2WETay77K2O7o"> When I was young, my mother used to tell us Bible stories. She spent a long time on the story of Joseph. Oh, how I sympathized with this excellent one when I heard that he was cast into a pit and sold into slavery! Although I loved Joseph and realized that he was someone special, I did not know why he was so excellent. I knew only that Joseph was very good and that I wanted to be like him. Even after I had ministered the Word for years, I still did not know the reason for Joseph’s excellence. But now I can boldly give you the reason Joseph was excellent: it was because he was the reigning aspect of the mature life. And he was the reigning aspect of a matured Israel, not of Jacob. Thus, Joseph was the cream of a matured life. </p>
<p data-content-id="bdPZiOYGTI0GDMWc0r7m4R_gNH6ZCY4FzwTm0_1hM378LkILri-YBA6MHtvxUHmDQ"> What we see in Joseph, of course, is simply a shadow. In reality and in actuality, the reigning aspect typified by Joseph is Christ constituted into our being. We all are Jacobs, but we have the constitution of Christ within us. On the day we were regenerated, Christ was constituted into us. Eventually this Christ becomes our constitution. That part of our being that is constituted with Christ is neither our flesh nor our mind; rather, it is our spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31605" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">Second Timothy 4:22</span> says that Christ is with our spirit. This means that Christ is constituted into the depths of our being. The Christ-constituted aspect of our regenerated being is fully represented, portrayed, and typified by Joseph. Because Joseph represents the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1423" id="1423">[1423]</span> reigning aspect of a victorious and mature life, his life is recorded in the Bible in such an excellent way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIJSvCGyX3D0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs">I. LIVING AS A SHEAF OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="yObOo7LOjjFarxWXeCIo5MAs-U-nfP03Kiwq9oNdUXzgDgrb2yrYAyxlelIIkT9lp"> The first three chapters regarding the reigning part of a matured life are <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31606" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">chapters thirty-seven</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31607" data-verses="Genesis 38:1">thirty-eight</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31608" data-verses="Genesis 39:1">thirty-nine</span>. As a child, I used to dislike these chapters because they were filled with hatred, plotting, and betrayals. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31609" data-verses="Genesis 38:1">Chapter thirty-eight</span> is a record of Judah’s incest, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31610" data-verses="Genesis 39:1">chapter thirty-nine</span> we see darkness and the indulgence in lust. Have you ever loved these chapters? After I was saved and began to love the Bible, I did not spend much time on these chapters. Having become familiar with the story found in them, I did not care to read these chapters again. When in 1955 I conducted a study on the book of Genesis, I skipped over them. But during the twenty-three years since that study was conducted, I have received more light. After I came to this country, I saw the value, the preciousness, of Joseph’s dreams, which are the controlling view of these chapters. If you have not seen the vision of Joseph’s dreams, you will be able to know no more than the story contained in these chapters. You will not be able to know the depths of the significance of this story. Joseph’s dreams controlled and directed his life. Joseph conducted himself in such an excellent way as the reigning aspect of a mature life under the direction of this controlling vision. </p>
<p data-content-id="e4Tu7RSEEn956Bu43KIdEs9VenExLhbqE99G8qhMhliWdoAMPEcx2IgxrawDytCgr"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31611" data-verses="Genesis 37:1">Chapter thirty-seven</span> begins by telling us how Jacob loved his dear son Joseph, and how Joseph reported the evils of his brothers to his father. Then we are told about Joseph’s dreams (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31612" data-verses="Genesis 37:5-10">37:5-10</span>). In these days the Lord has shown us that Joseph’s dreams reveal the actual situation of God’s people in His eyes. God’s people are all sheaves of life. A sheaf is a bundle of wheat full of life and life supply. The sheaves contain life grains which are good for life supply. Do not say, “I don’t like the Israelites, because they are so evil.” Remember the case of the Gentile prophet Balaam who was bribed to pronounce a curse upon Israel. At that time, Israel actually was evil. Nevertheless, Balaam, under the control of God, said that God had not beheld iniquity in Jacob nor perverseness in <span class="pg" data-page-id="1424" id="1424">[1424]</span> Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31613" data-verses="Numbers 23:21">Num. 23:21</span>). On the contrary, in God’s eyes all His chosen people are sheaves of life, full of life supply. Furthermore, God’s people are like stars shining in the sky. </p>
<p data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_KVfOUOBYw3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj"> After telling us of these two dreams, the record of the book of Genesis reveals that Joseph’s brothers plotted to kill him and that he was sold into slavery in Egypt. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31614" data-verses="Genesis 38:1">chapter thirty-eight</span> we see the incestuous sin of Judah, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31615" data-verses="Genesis 39:1">chapter thirty-nine</span>, the darkest temptation and most unjust treatment of Joseph. According to the sequence of events in these chapters, we see that Joseph’s excellent behavior was under the direction of his dreams. In his first dream he saw that he was one of the sheaves; and he was not a sheaf falling down, but a sheaf rising up. I believe that from the time of that dream Joseph realized where God had put him and what God wanted him to be. He no doubt understood that God wanted him to be such a sheaf. He was not to be driftwood full of death, but a sheaf standing up full of life. If you had had such a dream, would you not be influenced, if not controlled, by it? Would this dream not govern your behavior and direct your conduct? Certainly it would. I believe that Joseph’s dream of the sheaf directed his behavior. </p>

In addition, according to the four Gospels, Christ was betrayed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31635" data-verses="Matthew 26:14-16">Matt. 26:14-16</span>). Joseph, as a type of Christ, also was betrayed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31636" data-verses="Genesis 37:27-28">Gen. 37:27-28</span>). In the biblical sense, to be betrayed means to be despised, depreciated, dishonored, or disregarded. When Judas was about to sell Christ, he certainly was lowering down the value of Christ to the uttermost. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31637" data-verses="Matthew 26:1">Matthew 26</span> we see that Christ was a test to all those around Him. Some hated Him. Mary, however, appreciated Him and poured valuable ointment upon Him. To Mary, Christ was valuable, and she highly appreciated Him. But Judas despised Christ, dishonored Him, and disregarded Him. He depreciated Christ to such a degree that he sold Him for a cheap price, for thirty pieces of silver, which according to Exodus was the price of a slave (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31638" data-verses="Exodus 21:32">Exo. 21:32</span>). Thus, in the Bible to betray someone means to depreciate him. </p>
<p data-content-id="QMSNPOcCBLw6v-EOydvwZFF9It8TduX4YH5_O01lRUzkJdbjHu_x8PZ2HwO74uIjb"> Whenever you are depreciated by someone, it means that you are betrayed by him. Whenever your wife depreciates you, she is betraying you. Likewise, if the brothers disregard <span class="pg" data-page-id="1432" id="1432">[1432]</span> you, it means that you have been betrayed. Consider how you evaluate yourself. In your thinking are you not valuable? We all regard ourselves as valuable. Therefore, when we are depreciated by others or disregarded by them, we are betrayed. You may think that during the years you have been in the church life you have never seen a betrayal. However, in the church life people are often betrayed in the sense of being disregarded or depreciated. Day after day, husbands may depreciate their wives or wives may disregard their husbands. If some saints talk about another saint in a depreciating way, they are betraying him. </p>
<p data-content-id="KU_70gzM5Py2RG9fqhf7Xm7eenz93ZeKkGLP6dQOFNYrJaudPCQvOOcFS8BTESSTo"> We all think of ourselves as valuable. In actuality we are valuable because we have Christ in us. Do you not have God within you? In the Bible God is likened to gold, and Christ is likened to a treasure. Our God is the gold within us, and Christ within us is the treasure in the vessel. The unbelievers do not have such a high value because they do not have Christ within them. At most, they are simply muddy vessels. But we have the greatest treasure within us. Therefore, we should not think that we are not valuable. We need to declare to the angels, “Angels, you must realize how valuable I am. I’m valuable because Christ is in me.” Furthermore, you may boast to Satan and to the demons, “Satan, I want you to know that I have God and Christ within me. Demons, you are not destined to have Christ in you. But I have Christ in me and therefore I am valuable.” This is not pride; on the contrary, it is true humility. I would like to tell everyone, including the angels, the Devil, the demons, and everyone on earth, that I am valuable because I have Christ; therefore, you must not despise me or disregard me. </p>
<p data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hiItEH8TpcGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD"> We must learn not to sell our brothers. Joseph was sold by his brothers. If they had regarded him as a sheaf or a star, they would not have sold him. The fact that they betrayed Joseph means that they depreciated him and disregarded him. In principle, the same thing happened to the Lord Jesus. Although He was precious and valuable, Judas depreciated Him and sold Him for thirty pieces of silver. Peter, James, John, and all the other Apostles followed the footsteps of the Lamb, and they also were depreciated. This was also true of <span class="pg" data-page-id="1433" id="1433">[1433]</span> the Apostle Paul. Throughout the centuries, the followers of the Lamb have been betrayed. Like Christ, they have been depreciated, disregarded, and despised. As we follow the Lord today, we also are being depreciated. We endure many sufferings simply because we are despised and disregarded. Those who oppose us depreciate us and disregard us. If they appreciated the treasure within us and recognized the preciousness of what the Lord has wrought into us, they would neither despise us nor disregard us. Certain ones oppose us because they depreciate us. This depreciation is actually a form of selling us, and it is a sign of betrayal. Do not think that such a betrayal happened only to Joseph or to Christ as typified by Joseph. On the contrary, it has happened to all the followers of Christ and it is our experience today. </p>
<p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1rdWRIx_ldzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> Before we were saved, many of us were highly regarded by our parents, relatives, and friends. But after we were saved and began to seek the Lord, our friends, relatives, and in some cases even our parents began to despise us. This is betrayal. Christ’s crucifixion began with His betrayal. He was crucified after He was betrayed. It was the same in principle with Joseph. He was not directly cast into prison. First he was sold, and his being sold was the stepping-stone into prison. Christ’s betrayal was the stepping-stone to the cross. It is not an insignificant matter to be betrayed. All the persecution and opposition today is a type of betrayal. Those who oppose us are betraying us; they are selling us at a cheap price. Although we are valuable, the opposers sell us for such a low price, even for nothing. </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="aGZQhn44RfDLbiYsGGvVFSYgVrunKCGvuVmdAiPygWOGRgcCG0VL2WETay77K2O7o">(8) Delivered into the Prison of Death</h2><p data-content-id="bdPZiOYGTI0GDMWc0r7m4R_sNGe9CY4FzwTm0_1hM378LkILri-YBA6MHtvxUHmDQ"> Joseph’s betrayal was followed by a period of confinement, a period of imprisonment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31639" data-verses="Genesis 39:20">39:20</span>). Joseph was with two criminals, who typified the two criminals with Christ, one of whom was restored and the other executed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31640" data-verses="Genesis 40:1-23">40:1-23</span>). It was the same with Christ. After Christ was betrayed, He was put into the prison of death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31641" data-verses="Acts 2:23">Acts 2:23</span>). He was crucified between two criminals, one of whom was saved and the other perished (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31642" data-verses="Luke 23:32">Luke 23:32</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31643" data-verses="Luke 23:39-43">39-43</span>). Christ was confined in the prison of death for three days and three nights. As a type of Christ, Joseph <span class="pg" data-page-id="1434" id="1434">[1434]</span> had the same experience as Christ. He was rejected by his brothers, sold by them, and eventually cast into prison. Christ suffered the same things. Firstly, He was rejected by His brothers; then He was sold by one of His people, and eventually He was cast into the prison of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="qhmxD9GfKStgTt9vkbYIJSvOGwDPD0kChx5A1Yo3ihIiFGPBoL_0uYmF_uNu9cMDs"> Although Christ was resurrected after His death, His resurrection did not come immediately afterward. Humanly speaking, the three days of Christ’s confinement in the prison of death were not a short time. No night has ever lasted for three days and three nights. At the longest, night lasts from evening until morning. But the night Christ spent in the prison of death lasted for three days and three nights. If we had been Mary Magdalene, it would have been a long time to us, because she loved Christ, had followed Him, and had seen Him crucified and buried. After Christ’s death and burial, Mary had no heart to eat or sleep. Instead, she waited for something to happen. I do not believe that all the disciples could have forgotten that before His death Christ had said that He would be resurrected after three days. Even if they were not clear about what He had said, they must have been impressed with something regarding His resurrection. This must have been especially true of the sisters, for they often have a better memory than the brothers. Although Peter might not have been impressed with Christ’s coming resurrection, I do not believe that Mary Magdalene forgot that Jesus said that after three days He would rise from the dead. It was very difficult for her to wait for those three days. It would have been difficult to wait even three hours. At last, on the third day, the tomb where Jesus was buried was found empty. The three days and nights that Christ had been confined in the prison of death were a long night. Joseph’s night of confinement lasted approximately ten years. When Joseph was sold into slavery in Egypt, he was about seventeen years of age; and when he was released from prison, he was thirty. If you read the Bible carefully, you will see that it was not long after Joseph was sold to Potiphar that he was cast into prison. Joseph, therefore, was in prison for a long period of time, a long time of darkness. </p>

As we have pointed out, Joseph represents the reigning aspect of a mature life. As the representative of such a life, he is an excellent type of Christ. It is rare to find in the Old Testament such a complete and full type of Christ. Therefore, on the one hand, Joseph represents the reigning aspect of the mature life and, on the other hand, typifies Christ in a full way. Throughout the record of Joseph’s life there are two lines: the line of the type of Christ and the line of the secret of the reigning life. In this message we shall consider further the line of Joseph as a type of Christ, and in the next we shall consider the line of the secret of the reigning life. In previous messages we have covered eight aspects of Joseph as a type of Christ. In this message we shall cover seven more aspects. </p>

Christ was not arrested and cast into prison. Rather, He walked willingly into prison, that is, He went into the prison of death voluntarily. Although He entered into death willingly, the gates of Hades, which is the power of death, the authority of darkness, immediately rose up and sought to keep Him there forever. But as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31658" data-verses="Acts 2:24">Acts 2:24</span> says, it was impossible for Him to be held by death. Christ stayed in the prison of death for three days. During those days, the power of death did its best to imprison Him. But Christ could not be held by death because He is resurrection <span class="pg" data-page-id="1446" id="1446">[1446]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31659" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span>). Which is more powerful—death or resurrection? Resurrection is definitely more powerful than death. Thus, death could not hold Christ, who was not only life, but also resurrection. Therefore, Christ walked out of death. To Him, this walking out of death was His resurrection. As Joseph was released from the dungeon, so Christ was also released from the prison of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="E-xv1nlZl2LrnNkDtbmzPf4-dsG6tUIFb3C0mvDz1LtjokSWkphwKc-Ng-yoBiibt"> All Christians should be familiar with three things: the incarnation of Christ, the crucifixion of Christ, and the resurrection of Christ. I believe that we in the churches know these three matters. </p>

On the same day Joseph was released from the dungeon, he was enthroned to be the actual ruler over the whole land of Egypt. In like manner, after Christ was resurrected, He was enthroned with authority. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31664" data-verses="Acts 2:36">Acts 2:36</span> says that the crucified and resurrected Christ has been made both Lord and Christ. On the day of Pentecost, the Apostle Peter seemed to be saying to the Israelites who had rejected the Lord, “The One you rejected, put on the cross, and killed, God has raised up from the dead. Not only so, God has made Him the Lord of all.” This refers to Christ’s enthronement. What a great matter this is! </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="1lhNrjaZte5HPXZEsGKi7vGD5kNlWapGtWCjArEwGkMGDs5SY6tqeiBfvf-bRBNgQ">(11) Receiving Glory</h2><p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWiytu4trAfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> When Christ was enthroned, He received glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31665" data-verses="Hebrews 2:9">Heb. 2:9</span>). Joseph also typifies Christ in this regard, for when he was released from the dungeon, he received glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31666" data-verses="Genesis 41:42">41:42</span>). Joseph’s opposers not only sold him and despised him, but cast him into a dungeon. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31667" data-verses="Genesis 41:1">chapter forty-one</span> the prison is called a dungeon. The living conditions in Joseph’s dungeon were far worse than the conditions of the prisons in this country today. The dungeon into which Joseph was cast was a pit. Those who put him there did so with the intention that he would be severely distressed. But God lifted him up and not only placed him on the throne but also gave him glory. You <span class="pg" data-page-id="1447" id="1447">[1447]</span> may be wondering how we can prove that Joseph received glory. The proof is in the fact that he was clothed with beautiful garments and made to ride in the second chariot of Pharaoh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31668" data-verses="Genesis 41:42-43">41:42-43</span>). His being clothed with fine linen was in contrast with his being stripped by his brothers of his coat of many colors (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31669" data-verses="Genesis 37:23">37:23</span>). When people saw him clothed with such beautiful garments and sitting in Pharaoh’s chariot, they must have realized that here was a man in glory. </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXlU_1gNWQwrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip">(12) Receiving Gifts</h2><p data-content-id="TKhAe4ZC6z5arjrVt22LnYEiaAXyrZ2K9SFv8Eirw1ayyCMHvDu7OeXuflOX0S0q0"> When Joseph was released from the dungeon and uplifted to the throne, he received gifts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31670" data-verses="Genesis 41:42">41:42</span>). Christ also has received gifts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31671" data-verses="Acts 2:33">Acts 2:33</span>). Many Christians know that Christ resurrected, ascended, and has been crowned with honor and glory, but not many know that after Christ’s ascension, enthronement, and glorification He also received gifts. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31672" data-verses="Acts 2:33">Acts 2:33</span> says that Christ received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, which He has poured out. What Christ received of the Father was a gift. In ancient times, many centuries before Christ, the same thing happened to Joseph. Joseph was not only glorified but also received gifts. </p>
<p data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtrIWoiLr__u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m"> In his glorification Joseph was given three things: a golden ring, some garments, and a golden chain. The ring was put on his hand, the chain was placed on his neck, and the garments covered his entire body. These three items portray in a full way the gifts that Christ received in His ascension to the heavens, the gifts that He has passed on to the church. When the prodigal son came home, he received the first two gifts, the ring on his hand and the robe on his body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31673" data-verses="Luke 15:22">Luke 15:22</span>). At that time he did not receive the golden chain, which was to be given later. </p>
<p data-content-id="6CXs4WE0BL6-B1B4FDiAErZAue3HzGKjTYJeRnGmeXBe72gXmUfpgBoC9qhDjO81n"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31674" data-verses="Ephesians 1:13">Ephesians 1:13</span> says that we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit. This indicates that the Spirit of salvation is likened to a seal. We know that we are saved because we have been sealed. Fifty years ago I bought a gold-edged, leather bound edition of the Bible. As soon as I got it, I put my seal in the front of it to indicate that it belonged to me. I was afraid that otherwise it might be lost and I would have no way to prove that it was mine. After my Bible was sealed, however, I <span class="pg" data-page-id="1448" id="1448">[1448]</span> could prove that it belonged to me. Likewise, before we were saved, we were among the common people. But on the day we received the Lord Jesus, we were sealed. The seal of our salvation is the Holy Spirit of God. From that time onward, we have had a seal upon us. Suppose my Bible could say, “I don’t like Witness Lee. I would like to belong to someone else.” But my seal in the Bible would keep it from belonging to someone else. In like manner, we may feel that we do not want to belong to the Lord and that we would like to go along with Satan. Nevertheless, one who has been saved and sealed can never get away from the Lord. Even if it were possible for you to go into hell, you would still bear this seal. </p>
<p data-content-id="R_GfdTPWaEiXNNW82-yDbXV3DhuyLG6UWYb4K416h7Rart6vExDqqOyU38XwPBejO"> The ancient Egyptians used their ring as a seal. Whatever they sealed with their ring was something important to them. Thus, the ring, the seal, received by Joseph typifies the Holy Spirit received by Christ. At the time of Christ’s ascension and enthronement, Christ received of the Father the Holy Spirit that He might use Him as a seal to put on all His believers. Whenever anyone calls on Him, He puts this seal upon him. </p>
<p data-content-id="sHB9QAVlSM3v0XjManno_mQwrmH3fHA5fTkqfQSTHo75EQs1z1Iu7LXCJgPqSPnNs"> As a saved one, you have a living seal on you. Even if you were to go to a gambling casino in Las Vegas, you would still have this seal upon you, and it would make you feel that, because you belong to Jesus, you should not stay in such a place. As our Joseph, Christ has received the seal from the Father, and with it He has sealed us. Now this seal is within us and upon us. </p>
<p data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XR75Ddprow1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW"> The second of the gifts Joseph received was the garments. We believers need at least two garments, one for salvation and the other for victory, for reward. The prodigal son in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31675" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span> received just one garment because he was simply a saved one. He had not yet become victorious. After we have been saved and have received the garment of righteousness to justify us, we need to go on to live a victorious life. If we do, then in addition to the garment of salvation we shall receive another garment. </p>

JOSEPH BECOMING QUALIFIED IN AGE<br/>AFTER THE FURTHER SUFFERING OF TWO YEARS</h2><p data-content-id="h08U91ltZnqTUI0aV0g57niyiJICCw-cZTKHrVo12qTwS3OgmpjHqkUk9BKO83GId"> When some read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31702" data-verses="Genesis 40:1">chapter forty</span>, they may have the desire to speak to the Lord on Joseph’s behalf and ask the Lord why He kept Joseph in prison for such a long time. Joseph was seventeen or eighteen years of age when he was first put into prison, and he was about twenty-eight years of age when he interpreted the dreams of his two companions in prison. Although he had been in the dungeon for at least ten years prior to the release of his companions, his own dreams still had not yet been fulfilled. Perhaps you would say, “Lord, this is too much. You have tested Joseph for ten years already. Why didn’t You release him when You released his two companions? After Joseph had interpreted the dream of the cupbearer, he asked the cupbearer to remember him. But the cupbearer forgot Joseph, and nothing happened. Lord, it is easy for men to forget. But You are God, and You cannot forget things. Why did You keep Joseph in prison for another two years?” One day I was enlightened to see that Joseph remained in prison for another two full years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31703" data-verses="Genesis 41:1">41:1</span>) because it was necessary for him to reach the age of thirty (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31704" data-verses="Genesis 41:46">41:46</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UXIhvBFM2tXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> Today many young people expect to be released from their cage as soon as they turn eighteen. But according to the Bible, we need to reach the age, not of eighteen or even twenty-eight, but of thirty. Those who served God as priests began to do so in a full way at the age of thirty (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31705" data-verses="Numbers 4:3">Num. 4:3</span>). The ones under thirty were apprentices, not fully functioning priests <span class="pg" data-page-id="1458" id="1458">[1458]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31706" data-verses="Numbers 8:24">Num. 8:24</span>). When the Lord Jesus began to minister, He also was thirty years of age (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31707" data-verses="Luke 3:23">Luke 3:23</span>). Thus, if Joseph had come to the throne at the age of twenty-eight, he would not have typified Christ in this matter. He had to be thirty years of age. After I saw this, I was convinced that these further two years were necessary for Joseph to be qualified. If he had not stayed there for two additional years, he would have been under age. </p>
<p data-content-id="MtCll2XOY8R8dFgTUXdR5aNc7V878JwNRjNJM9TIVoQfsRCA1WYTsZI35lh9oQ1PX"> Young people, no matter how long your trial may be, do not be disappointed. You need to recognize that your trial is of God. No one can be enthroned without being tried and tested. Although we like to be enthroned immediately, God would say, “The time is not yet. Do not talk to Me about enthronement. You need to be put into the dungeon.” If you seek the Lord, the Lord will put you into a dungeon. Perhaps all who are around you—your wife, your children, the elders, and the brothers and sisters—intend to respect you; however, whatever they do only serves to put you into a dungeon. We have nothing to say about this. Without the dungeon, we cannot ascend to the throne. Do not be a dungeon dropout; stay in the dungeon until you graduate and receive the crown. You need the last two years. </p>
<p data-content-id="Vyv6cezndY8yrw_ApV0zOeU67H_2JbjcYWxSSt0SaXZR8SPfWLyu4As---ucS3eoN"> Although I may have no intention of putting you in a dungeon and although you may have no intention of putting me in a dungeon, what actually happens is that we put one another into a dungeon. When you were married, did you intend to put your wife into a dungeon? Surely you had no such intention. But this is just what you have done. Unintentionally and unconsciously, we put others into a dungeon. My children have done this to me. Sometimes they tell me how much they love me, but within myself I say, “Your love puts me into a dungeon.” Nevertheless, we need to say, “Hallelujah for the dungeon! Although I have been here for ten years, I need to stay another two years.” Again I say, do not drop out of the dungeon. Stay there and stay there gloriously, with praises to the Lord, not with the gnashing of teeth. </p>

For this, he had to be thirty years of age. Those twelve years in the dungeon accomplished a great deal for him, not through objective education but through subjective suffering and discipline.

JOSEPH RELEASED FROM PRISON INDIRECTLY<br/>THROUGH HIS INTERPRETATION<br/>OF THE CUPBEARER’S DREAM</h2><p data-content-id="3aA1vQJsnjca0yGkqenQapEhrmhcHTB_3F2dj540VtMU-lUPkPAPK_c8blOrW0hAd"> Now we come to my burden in this message. My burden is to point out that Joseph was released from prison through his speaking by faith. Joseph dreamed that he was a sheaf rising up and that his brothers were bowing down to him. Ten years went by, and still this dream had not been fulfilled. If this had happened to us, we would have been disappointed to the uttermost and said, “Forget about this dream. I’m through with being a dreamer and with hearing about dreams.” If Joseph had done this, he probably would never have been released from prison. He was released from the dungeon by speaking. However, Joseph was not released at the time he interpreted the dreams of his two companions. He interpreted their dreams by speaking in faith. If I had been the one interpreting dreams for others, I would have been afraid they would ask about my own dreams, because I would have had the vision, but not the experience or the fulfillment of the vision. Thus, I would not have dared to say anything for fear that someone might say, “What are you talking about? Don’t talk about dreams until your own dreams have been fulfilled. I don’t believe in you.” But no matter whether his dreams had <span class="pg" data-page-id="1460" id="1460">[1460]</span> been fulfilled or not, Joseph spoke boldly by faith. If he had been questioned, he might have said, “Yes, I have had two dreams. Although they have not been fulfilled, I still believe in them. Perhaps tomorrow they will be fulfilled.” Eventually, by his speaking Joseph was released from prison. If he had not spoken to the cupbearer, there would have been no one to tell Pharaoh about Joseph. It was the cupbearer who brought the news to Pharaoh that there was someone in prison who could interpret dreams (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31708" data-verses="Genesis 41:9-13">41:9-13</span>). Therefore, Joseph was released from prison indirectly through his interpretation of the cupbearer’s dream. </p>
<p data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYhw5Isege5oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa"> I have experienced this myself. In 1957 I was somewhat troubled by a problem that had arisen in the churches in Taiwan. But one day the Lord showed me that I should forget about the problem and begin to speak concerning the kingdom and the New Jerusalem, telling people that the church life today is a miniature of the New Jerusalem. Thus, I began to speak boldly, first in Taipei and then in Manila. An elderly British missionary attended the meetings in Manila and heard my messages. After one of the meetings, he came to me and said, “Brother Lee, do you mean these things to be for today or for the future?” When I said that I meant both, he replied, “The New Jerusalem will certainly be in the future, but I cannot see it here today. How can you say that it is both present and future?” Nevertheless, I continued to say that it was both. He would not believe it, but I did. Eventually, he left the church life. This indicates that the more you say no to the vision, the more you will be out. You may say, “There is no such thing as the church life; this is simply Brother Lee’s dream. Let’s forget about it.” But the more you say this, the more you will be out of today’s church life. We need to say, “Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! I believe that the church life is here today.” The more you say this, the more you will be in it. This is a dreamer’s vision. </p>

<p data-content-id="nZiM-ipcg3e7sGO72XgtrIWwiKvD_u5PvNt4Civ8pN10xcBNLKhIF4jVhrn1Bb67m"> To many readers of the book of Genesis, the stories of Joseph are like the stories told to kindergarten children. However, we must remember that in the book of Genesis the seeds of nearly all the spiritual truths are sown. Whether the record of Joseph is merely a series of kindergarten stories or the seeds of the divine truths depends upon our point of view in reading it. If we look at the record of Joseph’s life from the point of view of a kindergarten child, we shall read it merely as a story for children. But if we see that Jacob had passed through so many tests and had become matured in life, we shall see that the record of Joseph is not merely a story, but a revelation of the reigning aspect of a matured saint. If we view the record of Joseph as being the reigning aspect of a mature saint, our understanding will be revolutionized. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31711" data-verses="Genesis 42:1">Genesis 42</span>, therefore, which we shall consider in this message, is not a kindergarten story; it is part of the reigning aspect of a mature life. </p>
<p data-content-id="6CXs4WE0BL6-B1B4FDiAErZYufD3zGKjTYJeRnGmeXBe72gXmUfpgBoC9qhDjO81n"> What we see in the life of Joseph is the rulership of the Spirit. You may have heard of the regeneration of the Spirit, the conviction of the Spirit, the inspiration of the Spirit, the infilling of the Spirit, the anointing of the Spirit, the power of the Spirit, the light of the Spirit, and the life of the Spirit, but the term the rulership of the Spirit is something new. We all need to be under the rulership of the Spirit. This aspect of the Spirit is higher than any other aspect. It is even higher than the building of the Spirit. The rulership of the Spirit is the topstone, the capstone, of the structure of the teaching of the Spirit. The record of Joseph’s life is a revelation of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1470" id="1470">[1470]</span> rulership of the Spirit, for the rulership of the Spirit is the reigning aspect of a matured saint. </p>

We see these two lines in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31712" data-verses="Genesis 42:1">chapter forty-two</span>. In order to have an adequate interpretation of this chapter, we need to consider both lines. We need to follow these two lines to the end of the record of Joseph’s life. Both lines afford us light and nourishment. When I was a young Christian, I heard a great deal about Joseph being a type of Christ. However, what I heard only included the general points. Many details were left out, and certain chapters were even skipped. I also heard about Joseph’s personal life, but the emphasis was mainly on those aspects of Joseph’s life which could edify the young saints and teach them to be patient, forgiving, and loving. None of the messages I heard about Joseph used the term life. In this message we shall cover a number of matters pertaining to Joseph as a type of Christ. In the next message we shall consider more of Joseph’s personal life. If we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31713" data-verses="Genesis 42:1">chapter forty-two</span> carefully, we shall see that it gives a vivid portrait of Christ. </p>

At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31716" data-verses="Genesis 42:1">chapter forty-two</span> the whole earth was under famine. This is exactly the situation today. A famine is a severe shortage of food, the means by which human beings maintain their existence. Food, however, not only maintains our existence, but also gives us satisfaction. When we eat and drink, we do not merely have the sense that we are maintaining our existence, but that we are being satisfied. When I am filled with good food, I am happy. Thus, a famine actually denotes dissatisfaction. The whole world today is dissatisfied. </p>
<p data-content-id="wBUUQOcoHEGPrt-Vhb3XR75bdprIw1gloYKhyLKad2S9c68uEruWXN3EPpZqqr1fW"> The nation of Israel in particular is experiencing such dissatisfaction. This nation is aggressively striving and struggling <span class="pg" data-page-id="1471" id="1471">[1471]</span> to maintain its existence. If you visit Israel, you will certainly sympathize with them, for they definitely need protection and safety to secure their existence. Israel seems to need the Golan Heights and the settlements along the Sinai wilderness to secure its existence. The reason the nation of Israel is striving and struggling is that it is under famine, under dissatisfaction. The United States, the leading country on earth, is in the same situation. It also is experiencing dissatisfaction. We need to apply <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31717" data-verses="Genesis 42:1">Genesis 42</span> to today’s world situation. If we do, we shall see that the entire world is in a famine. </p>

This indicates in type that food is only where Christ is. In other words, satisfaction can only be found in Christ. Where Christ is, there is satisfaction. Today, Christ is in the church. If you are in the church yet are not enjoying satisfaction, it indicates that you are in a famine. I can declare to all that I am not in a famine. Day by day I am nourished, filled, and satisfied with good food. Oh, the church is the land of satisfaction, the region of satisfaction, because Christ is here! Food, nourishment, and satisfaction are only where Christ is. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zrc7c8dNQn2sqn_71HROnLDhTljOOlGnTDqcNXPbsC5_JuExBlp8_VghoNSpsDWGX"> I truly sympathize with the nation of Israel. There is no need for them to struggle and strive or to negotiate with Egypt. They need to turn to Christ. The prime minister of Israel does not need to go to Washington or to Cairo; instead, he should carry out negotiations with Christ. If the Jews would call on Him, everything would be settled. Neither Cairo nor Washington can solve Israel’s problem of dissatisfaction. The famine will end only when they turn to Christ and go where He is. Perhaps some saints of Jewish origin should write a letter to the Israeli prime minister telling him that the only person who can solve Israel’s problems and give satisfaction is Christ. Some day the Jews will turn to the Lord Jesus. When they realize that all their struggles are in vain, they will be forced in their desperation to turn to Christ. Praise the Lord that we have taken the lead to turn to Him! <span class="pg" data-page-id="1472" id="1472">[1472]</span> We are pioneers in this matter. More than fifty years ago I turned to Christ, having come to the realization that I was in a land of famine and that I was very dissatisfied. We who have turned to Christ have found food, nourishment, and satisfaction, for the food is found only where Christ is. </p>

Presently they are neither willing nor inclined to do this because they are ignorant of Christ.

We, however, are knowledgeable regarding Him. Oh, we know Christ! We in the churches are not stupid. We know the world situation better than the political leaders do. We are at least as intelligent as the diplomats are, if not more intelligent. Because we are not stupid, but rather the most clever of people, we know where we must spend our time. The church is the best place for the young people to spend their time. When I was a teenager, I wasted time in so many activities. Eventually, I realized how dissatisfied I was and I turned to Christ. Now I am in the good land, the land of the church. I enjoy this land because Christ is here.

I love the line of life even more than the line of Joseph as a type of Christ. As I was contacting the Lord with a praying spirit, the Lord showed me the points in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31729" data-verses="Genesis 42:1">chapter forty-two</span> regarding Joseph’s personal life which we shall cover in this message. </p>

Joseph was seventeen years old when he had his dreams. At the age of thirty he was exalted to rule over the land of Egypt. About nine years later Joseph’s brothers bowed themselves down to him. This means that Joseph would have been probably thirty-nine years of age when his brothers came to him. Thus, about twenty-two years after his dreams, Joseph saw them fulfilled, but not until he had been betrayed and imprisoned. Then he spent many years in the dungeon and eventually was elevated to the throne at the time of his exaltation. But still Joseph did not see the fulfillment of his dreams. He had interpreted the dreams of his companions in prison and the dreams of Pharaoh, and the fulfillment of those dreams was a strong confirmation that his own dreams would be fulfilled. Nevertheless, Joseph had to pass through a long period of testing. It may seem to us that his patience would have been exhausted. Could you have waited twenty-two years for the fulfillment of your dreams? Joseph did. </p>
<p data-content-id="-OVm4LA8AS9u76JPys3Q-SAM1C-JgjG8B3RTmSilYOovbkO0Aau81dvLNAyH3i8ds"> Then on a certain day his brothers came and bowed down to him. If we had been Joseph, we would not have been able to <span class="pg" data-page-id="1478" id="1478">[1478]</span> contain our excitement. We would have jumped up and shouted, “Hallelujah! Don’t you know that I am Joseph? How happy I am to see you!” We would have been beside ourselves with excitement. If the sisters among us had been there, they would have first wept and then embraced all the brothers. Joseph, however, was not out of control when he saw the fulfillment of his dreams. Rather, he was calm and his excitement was under control. He was able to control himself in such a way because he was a person with the rulership of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="prNfLWZ9JdrW7yTc3YS3V_fH_o1moK-lAf5XbjI5e4-Pr6RDr_aquY_gO4K9YJN2U"> If you cannot control your own excitement, you cannot be a proper ruler. The ruling aspect of the mature life knows how to be calm, even in the most exciting situation. You may say, “Didn’t Joseph weep when he saw his brothers?” Yes, he did. Joseph was a human being full of sentiment and normal feelings, not stone or wood. Nevertheless, even in his weeping we see that he was a person who ruled himself. Apart from Joseph, no one else could have controlled himself in such an exciting situation. But he conducted himself outwardly as if nothing had happened. This is the ruling life, the victorious life. </p>
<p data-content-id="vGPkFtfe7Aen3iGIVhF4Ccm_r6BhJoSKHjShQRi-Q6TFheMiOa11sXw6WrcmFYS61"> Often it is necessary for us to hold back our excitement. When Aaron’s two sons were killed in the presence of God, Moses’ words to Aaron implied that he should not weep, and immediately Aaron held back his tears (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31731" data-verses="Leviticus 10:1-7">Lev. 10:1-7</span>). Many times we also must hold back our tears and place ourselves under the rulership of the Spirit. A proverb says one who rules his spirit is better than one who takes a city (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31732" data-verses="Proverbs 16:32">Prov. 16:32</span>). The fact that Joseph remained calm under the rulership of the Spirit proved that he was the one qualified to carry out such a vast administration. Even in the most exciting of circumstances, he was not touched by any excitement. On the contrary, he remained calm, sober, and reasonable. </p>

Not until his brothers’ third trip did he reveal himself to them and <span class="pg" data-page-id="1479" id="1479">[1479]</span> expose his glory to them. Concealing our glory is even more difficult than holding back our excitement. You may be successful in restraining your excitement, but it is virtually impossible for anyone not to expose his glory. Joseph, however, was successful in this matter. He did not reveal his glory to his brothers immediately. This is another reason Joseph represents the reigning aspect of the mature life. He certainly had the qualifications of a ruler. Not until our self and our natural man have been thoroughly dealt with can we keep from revealing our glory to others. Joseph was a man who had been thoroughly dealt with and who was living under the rulership of the Spirit. Thus, he was qualified to be the reigning aspect of the mature life. </p>
<p data-content-id="4ih-7ivO1f_Uex_xN1d2yIN1dJq1CD7MrPWGnia394uU8LdMUmJUsII4OLzctGMcQ"> My burden in these messages is not merely to pass on teachings. It is to help you see the life in the book of Genesis and to know the way of life. The life manifested in the story of Joseph is not the human life, much less the fallen life. Moreover, it is not even the good natural life. Rather, it is the resurrection life, the life of God. Although Joseph was in an exciting situation, he did not display any looseness. This is life. With Joseph we see not only life but also the way of life, which is to keep ourselves under control. Never think that Joseph was not human. He was full of human feelings and sentiments, but he kept himself with all his feelings under the rulership of the Spirit. Therefore, in Joseph we see not only the mature life but a reigning life and the way of this reigning life. We all, especially the young people, need such a life and such a way that is the reigning aspect of a mature person. This life is not easily excited, and it does not reveal its glory. Instead, in the midst of excitement it remains calm, controls itself, and conceals its glory. </p>

He was not at all loose. If I had been Joseph, I would have said to them, “Hallelujah, let us dance and have a feast! Let us be happy together.” But Joseph did nothing like this.

He did this for the purpose of causing them to realize their guilt in hating him and in selling him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31734" data-verses="Genesis 42:21">42:21</span>). If I had been Joseph, I would have put them into prison for three hours. I would have been too excited to keep them there any longer. I would not have been able to wait until I could feast with my brothers. Even if my brothers could have been patient, I would not have had the patience to wait three days. Three hours, however, would not have been adequate for Joseph’s brothers to realize their guilt. They needed to be in prison for three days. During those days, they must have talked a great deal about what they had done to Joseph. Thinking that Joseph was not able to understand them, they even spoke in Joseph’s presence about what they had done to him. But Joseph knew what they were talking about. How Joseph’s brothers regretted what they had done to him! But Joseph seemed to say to himself, “Talk is not adequate. I should put them into prison so that they can become sober. Let them fellowship with one another in prison for three days and three nights.” This was Joseph’s way to cause his brothers to have a thorough realization of their guilt. When we are in a pleasant situation, it is difficult to realize our guilt and to repent. But if we are cast into prison, it is easy for us to repent and to condemn ourselves. </p>

<p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXR0zFfpYi443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> The story of Joseph’s being recognized by his brothers is the longest story in the book of Genesis, occupying three and a half chapters, from the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31746" data-verses="Genesis 42:1">chapter forty-two</span> to the middle of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31747" data-verses="Genesis 45:1">chapter forty-five</span>. When I was young, I thought that Joseph was too hard on his brothers. I thought that it was all right for Joseph to be hard on them the first time they came to Egypt to buy grain. As a man of God, he had the patience to discipline them, and for at least six months they underwent a trial. However, when they came to Egypt the second time, I thought that Joseph should not have done anything further to discipline them. According to my opinion, Joseph should have immediately revealed himself to them. However, Joseph did not do this. </p>
<p data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkx_ROeMnOoPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU"> For a long time I wondered about the reason for this. Certainly the first test of Joseph’s brothers was necessary. We all agree with Joseph in testing them the first time. However, perhaps you also have wondered why Joseph tested his brothers again. On the one hand, he spread a feast for them and ate with them. But on the other hand, he gave them more trouble. What was Joseph’s purpose in doing so? I believe Joseph expected his brothers to notice certain hints or indications and thus to recognize him. There should have been no need for Joseph to reveal himself to them directly. </p>
<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j7PqNaaGr9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> In order to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31748" data-verses="Genesis 43:1">chapter forty-three</span>, we need to remember that Joseph is both a type of Christ and also the reigning aspect of the mature life. Because Joseph was a type of Christ, we should not criticize anything he did. We are far below Joseph’s standard. Whatever he did was the best, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1490" id="1490">[1490]</span> whether we agree with it or not. The Christ typified by Joseph could not do anything wrong. We would not do the same thing Joseph did because we are not as mature as Joseph was. We do not represent the reigning aspect of the matured life; we represent disobedience. This is the reason we do not agree with Joseph. However, if we came up to Joseph’s standard, we would admit that what Joseph did to his brothers was the best. In his dealing with them there was no trace of childishness or foolishness. On the contrary, his dealings were wise and full of discernment. He dealt with his brothers so that they might be disciplined. Nothing he did to them was for his own benefit. </p>

According to the Bible, the house of Israel will return to Christ at the end of this age and recognize Jesus of Nazareth as their Messiah. However, before they do this, they will need to be tested. The book of Zechariah reveals that the remnant of Israel will be put on trial. Even a good number of the Israelites will be killed. At the time the house of Israel turns to Christ, not very many Israelites will remain. They will be tested because they refuse to return to the One they need. </p>
<p data-content-id="PCDDFHQRA7k3m1yAQk6KbZj9nRfTe1DRBGoLDOxVrb0Qt4UJI0xdLDZxeZiYsrWl1"> Consider the nation of Israel today. How they are struggling to protect themselves! Since 1918 I have been watching the world situation. Before the reformation of the nation of Israel, the Jews were scattered, and people paid little attention to them. Especially since 1967 the Middle East has been the focus of world news, the most crucial place on earth. Israel is opposed by nearly the whole world. Both the Arab countries and the United Nations condemn them. At times even the United States disagrees with Israel. Thus, she must fight for her existence. Israel is condemned by other countries because she has possession of the Golan Heights and the land west of the Jordan River. Israel insists on keeping these territories because she needs them to maintain her existence. However, if the nation of Israel would turn to Christ, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1491" id="1491">[1491]</span> everything would be solved. But Israel will not turn to Christ until she is forced to do so. </p>

Joseph’s brothers did not know that he was the ruler in Egypt. But their dissatisfaction due to the lack of food forced them to turn to Joseph. According to the prophecies in the Old Testament, the house of Israel will turn to Christ for no reason other than their need to maintain their existence. Apart from turning to Christ, there will be no way for them to exist. </p>
<p data-content-id="vGPkFtfe7Aen3iGIVhF4Ccm7r4FFJoSKHjShQRi-Q6TFheMiOa11sXw6WrcmFYS61"> It was the severity of the famine that forced Joseph’s brothers to come to him again. The first time they came to Egypt they obtained some food on which to live. Thus, they returned home and stayed away from Joseph for another period of time. This is a portrait of the dealing of Christ with the house of Israel today. Unless Israel is forced to turn to Him out of their need to maintain their existence, they will never turn to Christ. Because the food brought home by Joseph’s brothers was exhausted, and because the famine continued to be severe, they were forced to go again to the very one whom they did not want to see. I believe that after the first contact with Joseph his brothers had a bad impression of him. Perhaps they said, “If possible, we will never go back to that man. We don’t want to see him again. He treated us very badly.” The house of Israel is the same today regarding Christ. They do not want to even talk about Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, the steering wheel is not in their hands; it is in Christ’s hands. At a certain time, they will return to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="WzuLEplthatvdQSSWA3Ogkfb2ZITDZSPy14yL_3ObkmknNGHUmXuiVX2wg2eDlD12"> Joseph was wise and very experienced. He did not allow his excitement at seeing his brothers or his desire to see his father to cause him to act foolishly. Rather, he was wise and calm, disciplining his brothers at the sacrifice of fulfilling his desire to see his father. If I had been Joseph, I would have revealed myself to the brothers as soon as they came to me the second time, and I would have told them to hurry back to my father and bring him to me. I would not have even taken <span class="pg" data-page-id="1492" id="1492">[1492]</span> the time to feast with my brothers before sending them back to get my father. But if Joseph had been like this, he would not have been qualified to be the ruler of the world. Joseph was a person full of wise discernment. Thus, he was a full type of Christ. Christ never does anything according to His excitement. The world situation is under His hand. The car is not being driven by any worldly leader, but by the Lord Jesus. He is managing the situation in the Middle East. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yRy9ZdWwKGKqyNxpw_PRI1n6fWVG6mn7jVgZvQBYzd2Qm0ONMT8ncUwYwezcYFS3"> From the time Joseph’s brothers first came to Egypt, they were undergoing a test. I do not believe they had any happy times after meeting Joseph in Egypt. They would not have been able to forget Simeon who was in prison there. They also realized that their supply of food obtained in Egypt was limited. They knew that one day it would be exhausted and that they would have to return to Egypt and face that man again. Their need for food forced them to return to him. </p>
<p data-content-id="uMdoZ7sIrphDxIxrKnqKmfORCN9aZxYYQWIgd4x9rSnaU9KtTeicgVo8QagD4QHNt"> In order for Joseph’s brothers to recognize him, they had to pass through a certain process. According to the prophecies in the Bible, the house of Israel will need to pass through a similar process in order to recognize Christ as their Messiah. Christ will deal with them again and again until the house of Israel is forced to turn to Him. There simply will be no other way for Israel to exist. </p>

Christ will do the same thing to the nation of Israel. The prophecies in the Bible say that Christ will test the ignorant children of Israel, but they do not give the details. However, the record of Joseph’s dealing with his brothers gives us a detailed picture of this. Even today the nation of Israel is ignorant of the fact that Christ is testing them. As we follow the world news, we should hold a view different from that of the worldly people. When I read the news, I am aware that what is happening in the Middle East is part of Christ’s testing of Israel. The Israeli prime minister and his cabinet do not know that Christ is testing them. They claim to need the Golan Heights and the settlements along the Sinai to secure their existence. However, Christ knows better than they do what they need for their security. Do you not believe that what is happening to Israel today is a test? I certainly do. This is Joseph’s testing of his brothers in order to teach them and discipline them. I expect this testing to continue year after year. The Lord Jesus Christ knows how to deal with the nation of Israel. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1502" id="1502">[1502]</span> </p>

The same will be true of the nation of Israel as Christ continues to test them. What patience Joseph had! I do not have nearly the patience that he had or the patience that the Lord Jesus has with Israel today. If I had been Joseph, I would have revealed myself to the brothers much sooner than he did. And if I were the Lord Jesus, I would immediately tell the whole world that the Israelites are my brothers. Joseph, however, dealt with his brothers patiently. They were ignorant of him, and the Egyptians were ignorant of what was going on. Only Joseph knew what he was doing. The situation is the same today. Only the Lord Jesus, not the United Nations or the ruler of any country, knows what is taking place. Although He is giving the nation of Israel a difficult time, there is a definite purpose in all He is doing. </p>

I believe that the time is near when Christ will acknowledge the ignorant nation of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31766" data-verses="Romans 11:26">Rom. 11:26</span>). The acknowledgment of the United Nations does not mean anything. What counts is Christ’s acknowledgment. The day is coming when Christ will tell the world, “Don’t touch the nation of Israel. Whoever touches her touches the apple of My eye. The Israelites are My brothers.” </p>

Until they recognize Him, Christ will continue to deal with them patiently. Recently I read that some Jewish scholars have begun to study the case of Jesus. It seems that these scholars are eager to learn more about who Jesus is. Instead of acknowledging the Jews now, Christ is giving them a further time to consider Him. These Jewish scholars who are studying the case of Jesus admit that Christ has gained a <span class="pg" data-page-id="1503" id="1503">[1503]</span> great deal of credit for the Jewish people, for Christ came from the nation of Israel. He was and still is a Jew. If Christ had come out of your country, you certainly would be proud of Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="e4Tu7RSEEn956Bu43KIdEs9xenEhLhbqE99G8qhMhliWdoAMPEcx2IgxrawDytCgr"> If we keep all these points in mind as we follow the news in the Middle East, we shall be happy and praise the Lord. All that is happening today was foreshadowed in Joseph’s dealing with his brothers. In a sense, what we are seeing today is a motion picture of what has already taken place. Even as I am speaking about these chapters in Genesis, the events foreshadowed in them are taking place in the Middle East. What is happening today is the fulfillment of what is portrayed in this portion of the Word. Praise the Lord for His wisdom and patience! He knows what He is doing with Israel. In not too long a time, Christ will make an open recognition of the nation of Israel. He will do this by descending from the heavens to the earth. The Savior out of Zion will come to the land of Israel and recognize the nation of Israel as His nation. </p>
<p data-content-id="5UNgwWxynMJDq7jGxBK_KVfqUOBIw3WxA-tkscM-x-vlVI9BRoRRThtRBCyj2KAWj"> Now we come once again to a parenthesis covering certain matters on the line of life. I love the line of Joseph as a type of Christ, but, as far as I am concerned, the line of life is more practical. The line of the type concerns Israel, but the line of life concerns you and me. </p>
<p data-content-id="NgrUOPst9ndCGqPDKS1sOG8S5DPBKLEkyN_8bfWBSPyO-5g1-dnym0-8I86wUsKBc"> Although there were many clear indications of Joseph’s identity, his brothers could not recognize him because of their blindness and preoccupations. Because his brothers were so blind and ignorant of him, Joseph was compelled to take a further step to reveal himself to them. Joseph must have prayed concerning his dealing with his brothers. He did not deal with them according to his personal feelings or desires, but according to the Lord’s leading. Whatever Joseph did to his brothers was according to the Lord’s leading. </p>
<p data-content-id="topU0NZPOs7b25ters3Gc5W9K2iZhSqSpV5hz_XoXr_MU93J_kJdBBom0evJv9lGi"> No one else could have had the patience Joseph had. As we have pointed out, it took twenty-two years for his dreams to be fulfilled. After such a long period of time, Joseph had an intense desire to see his father. How could a man have had such patience? How could he have been able to control his emotion, his love, and his desire to see his father? Joseph’s patience and self-control must have been of the Lord. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1504" id="1504">[1504]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="h08U91ltZnqTUI0aV0g57niCiI8KCw-cZTKHrVo12qTwS3OgmpjHqkUk9BKO83GId"> After the last test, at least one of Joseph’s brothers, Judah, had improved. This is indicated by the way he spoke to Joseph about taking care of their father and their youngest brother (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31769" data-verses="Genesis 44:18-34">44:18-34</span>). When Joseph’s brothers sold him, they hated him and did not care for their father or youngest brother. Rather, they acted according to their hatred. But the way Judah spoke to Joseph indicated that he cared about his father and his youngest brother. This touched Joseph very deeply and convinced him that his brothers had learned their lesson. Thus, immediately after this, Joseph acknowledged them. Prior to this time, the brothers were still learning the lessons. The lessons were not completed until at least one among them had improved and had learned to care for his father and youngest brother. Until that time, Joseph exercised great patience in testing his brothers. </p>
<p data-content-id="UZPOfytEyEmR1WwooV8UXIhfBEo6tXbzUy3Vl_F38nLYVNeFAXeFRGe1qYY0Aa5qS"> In my opinion Joseph should have revealed himself to his brothers immediately after feasting with them. However, he did not do this. Instead, he charged his steward to fill their sacks with grain and to return their money (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31770" data-verses="Genesis 44:1-2">44:1-2</span>). No doubt Joseph’s brothers were happy. If I had been one of the brothers, I would have said to the others on the way back to Canaan, “What do you think about that ruler? Why was he so nice to us? He is the ruler of the whole earth and we are foreigners coming to buy food. Yet he invited us to his home and feasted with us. He even gave Benjamin a portion five times greater than what he gave the rest of us. Moreover, he seated us according to our birth. What is this all about? Who is this man?” I believe that Joseph expected his brothers to talk like this. He expected them to thoroughly consider him. But they were careless and they did not do this. There must have been certain features of Joseph’s face that would have enabled them to recognize him. But his brothers were too blind to notice them. </p>

This typifies that one day Christ will reveal Himself to the remnant of Israel. Christ, the exalted One in the heavens, has His own temperament. He knows what He has to do to test Israel, and He knows how long the test should last. At the right time, the trial of Israel will end. After all the saints have been raptured and after the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ has been carried out, Christ, with the overcoming saints, will be revealed from the heavens, and the remnant of Israel will see Him.

When Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, he said that God had made him a father to Pharaoh, the lord of all his house, and the ruler throughout all the land of Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31787" data-verses="Genesis 45:8">45:8</span>). Even Pharaoh was under Joseph’s instruction. When Christ will reveal Himself in His glory to the remnant of Israel, the Jews will realize that He is far greater than they expected their Messiah to be. </p>
<h2 class="head7" data-content-id="G7sDBOjV7kQqQGQpoLsYhw58scU65oNWzynhkAzTQffYuoCgJNwAUG1H0HJg2IuHa">(r) Israel Participating in the Enjoyment of Christ’s Reign</h2><p data-content-id="IXZ166e46nIwP6Zzb-yts0PCAKBFlPLNVVdOdQt0xzDVNbCBs_QVK4dsp6PP_NREo"> After Christ reveals Himself to the remnant of Israel, He will begin His millennial reign. During the millennium, the Jews will participate in the enjoyment of Christ’s reign, just as Joseph’s brothers participated in the enjoyment of his reign (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31788" data-verses="Genesis 45:18">45:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31789" data-verses="Genesis 47:4-6">47:4-6</span>). Joseph’s brothers enjoyed the best portion of the land in Egypt. This is a type of the millennium in which the Jews will enjoy the best things of earth. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31790" data-verses="Zechariah 14:16-19">Zechariah 14:16-19</span>, the Egyptians and those from the other nations will be required to present offerings to the Lord in Jerusalem. If a nation refuses to go up to Jerusalem with offerings for the Lord, no rain will fall upon their land. Because the Jews will be one with God, whatever is offered to Him will be their portion and enjoyment. According to the Old Testament, what was offered to God became the portion of the priests. In like manner, what is offered to God during the thousand years will become the portion of the Jews, who will be the priests instructing the people on earth, especially the Egyptians, in the way to worship God. I believe that during the millennium many Egyptians will repent for the way they dealt with Israel in this age. The Egyptians may say to the Jews, “We repent. We didn’t know that you were such a people. Whatever we have that you want, just take it.” This will take place according to the prophecy and the type in the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="HptCaTIcG2Enqu9W_mqXR0z9focO443JxVVnTdu3MlrWBiMJJm-D3MeSpxzVDirpP"> Now we come, once again, to a parenthesis regarding the matter of life. Remember, nearly everything in the book of Genesis is a seed. The first book of the New Testament, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1513" id="1513">[1513]</span> Gospel of Matthew, reveals Christ on the one hand and the kingdom of God on the other hand. Matthew also clearly indicates that we realize God’s kingdom by denying ourselves. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31791" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">Matthew 16</span> Christ, the church, and the kingdom are all revealed. In this chapter the Lord Jesus told His disciples that if anyone would follow Him, this one would have to deny himself. At the end of Genesis we find a seed of the truth of self-denial. In the closing chapters of Genesis, Christ is typified by Joseph, and the kingdom is foreshadowed by the house of Israel. Because Joseph denied himself, the kingdom of God could be realized in a practical way. The entire universe belongs to God, and God desires a kingdom. Although Pharaoh was ruling in Egypt, the kingdom of God was nonetheless realized through the reign of Joseph. The reigning of Joseph was the kingdom of God, which is for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. According to the book of Exodus, the purpose of God is to have a dwelling place on earth. But at the end of Genesis we see a miniature of God’s kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="XpLchAHxdZVJR6-UO_kkx_R2eNTuoPMvGMA5WXb93G50eFnjuG5HS3prKHNL-JkXU"> In all of history we cannot find anyone to match Joseph. Although he was offended by his brothers to the uttermost, he did not seek revenge. With Joseph, there was no thought of revenge. Rather, he denied himself and rendered the adequate and necessary discipline to his brothers. Joseph did not discipline his brothers for his own sake, but for their sake. Having no thought of revenge, he was concerned that his brothers might be perfected and built up so that they might live together as a collective people. The fact that Joseph charged them not to quarrel on the way home reveals his concern for them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31792" data-verses="Genesis 45:24">45:24</span>). The desire of Joseph’s heart was that his brothers would be a people living together as God’s testimony on earth. Joseph seemed to say to them, “I have done everything for you, and you have all you need. Now go back with thanksgiving to God to see my father and bring him back to me. But I am concerned that you might quarrel with one another on the way.” Joseph’s word about quarreling also indicates that he disciplined his brothers. He disciplined nine of the brothers in a general way and Simeon in a specific way. By this we see his discipline was sober; it was not motivated by anger. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1514" id="1514">[1514]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ky2yxHfkRL-a3DFd4Q3j7Pq1abiP9Z7B6U5-VIoMXDMdaYpv3seA_J3LH1sHFtQ35"> Joseph was a person who denied himself. Whatever he did was based upon the principle of self-denial. I do not know of any other person who was offended to the degree Joseph was, yet who had not the slightest desire for revenge. When he revealed himself to his brothers, they were terrified (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31793" data-verses="Genesis 45:3">45:3</span>, Heb.). Joseph, however, not only forgave them, but received them and comforted them. He said, “Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31794" data-verses="Genesis 45:5">45:5</span>). Here we see that the offended one comforted the offending ones. </p>
<p data-content-id="JMrn2wsx20o4jdNC6A2hiItoH8T5cGO9MzYSeabphq_VjUOxqOhv12J37J21d2yOD"> Often when Christians forgive someone, they say, “Yes, I forgive you, but I also want to remind you of the seriousness of what you have done.” This kind of forgiveness does not mean anything, for actually it is not forgiveness at all. When Joseph forgave his brothers, he comforted them and told them not to be angry with themselves, but to forget what they had done to him. He said that their selling him into slavery was God’s doing to preserve life. Joseph did not blame his brothers for what they had done; rather, he regarded them as God’s helpers. They had helped God to get him to Egypt. </p>
<p data-content-id="zB_eXu-tRTr5QFzaWcw1rdW9Ix_1dzArKd5KBixVIB5WkdajDhvAkPSQwTjAx--5S"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31795" data-verses="Genesis 45:7">verse 7</span> Joseph said, “God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.” The Hebrew word rendered “posterity” is better translated “remnant.” God’s purpose required a remnant. His intention was that the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob would build Him a tabernacle so that He might establish His kingdom on earth. If the remnant had been cut off, God’s purpose could not have been fulfilled. In that case, the book of Genesis would have been the last book of the Bible. Knowing that the famine would have terminated everyone living in the land of Canaan, God prepared a way for the remnant of the chosen and called race to continue to exist. </p>

First, He will supply people with food, that is, He will satisfy everyone’s needs (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31805" data-verses="Genesis 47:15-17">47:15-17</span>). Although the whole earth was under a famine, Joseph was able to satisfy everyone’s hunger. Today everyone is hungry and no one is satisfied.

Because Christ will satisfy everyone’s needs, He will be able to make everyone alive, to make everyone living. If you examine the prophecies regarding Christ’s reign in the millennium, you will see that Christ will make everything living. Today, death is everywhere; everyone and everything is <span class="pg" data-page-id="1524" id="1524">[1524]</span> dying.

In today’s situation, on the contrary, everything is diminishing. But when the millennium comes, everything on earth will be productive. In order to produce, we must have seed. While food is for satisfaction, seed is for production. As He reigns in the millennium, Christ will not only afford people food to satisfy them, but supply them with seed to make them productive. </p>

This typifies that during the millennium Christ will take special care of Israel. Israel’s specific function on earth is to testify of God. Although Christ is in favor of Israel, today Israel has no faith in Christ. The Jews worship God, but they do not have the proper faith in God through Christ. Instead, they believe in God in their own way. However, whether or not Israel is in unbelief, they are still the testimony of God, even today. There will be many nations on earth during the millennium, but only one nation, Israel, will be God’s testimony. For this reason, Christ will take special care of Israel. When He renders this care to Israel, it will indicate that He is absolutely for God’s testimony. Likewise, the reason Christ loves the church is that the church is God’s testimony. Therefore, in the millennium Christ will satisfy everyone, make everything alive, make everything productive, and take good care of Israel as God’s testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="9q8Qqyqejj85zTAXPLWWiydi4trQfj6OnTg0D_675zms5R1ywKPsCbYaKr8l2YfjK"> Now we come to the line of life. When I first read that Joseph collected money, cattle, and land in exchange for food, I said, “Joseph, you are a robber. You not only robbed the people, you extracted everything from them. You collected their money, livestock, and land. Eventually, you collected their very being. Joseph, what kind of landlord are you?” <span class="pg" data-page-id="1525" id="1525">[1525]</span> Joseph alone held the lifeline, and the lifeline was food. Those who wanted food had to give something to Joseph in order to get it. If they wanted satisfaction, they had to pay for it with money, cattle, or land. First Joseph “gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31810" data-verses="Genesis 47:14">47:14</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31811" data-verses="Genesis 47:15">Verse 15</span> says, “And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money hath ceased” (Heb.). When the people said this to Joseph, he told them to give him their cattle. Thus, the people brought their cattle to Joseph, and “Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31812" data-verses="Genesis 47:17">47:17</span>). A year later, the people came to Joseph again in need of food once more. This time there was no need for negotiation because there was a mutual understanding between Joseph and the people. The only thing they had left was their land and themselves. Therefore, they told him to buy them and their land for bread (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31813" data-verses="Genesis 47:19">47:19</span>). Eventually, in Egypt Joseph was the only landlord, banker, and cattle raiser. </p>
<p data-content-id="jkJi6ZXHYIeQPKrpGjRXlUP5gNWAwrkRntlVxX4Z9f1nlaZblxWH5JUUMlYf3Ojip"> Joseph had the supply of life, the supply of food. According to our natural concept, Joseph should simply have given it away. But we should not bring our natural, worldly concept to the reading of the Bible. Joseph had the life supply, and the people needed it. They had to do something in order to get it. Before we see what the people had to do, we need to point out the reason Joseph became so rich and had the life supply. It was because of all his sufferings. From the time Joseph was seventeen years of age, he had been suffering. Even after he had been enthroned and was in power, he was still suffering because he was separated from his father. As we pointed out in the previous message, he had the power and the position to do everything necessary to have his father brought to him. But he refrained from doing so because he was in Egypt to fulfill God’s will. In order for God’s will to be fulfilled, Joseph had to suffer. Although he was the ruler, he suffered until the day his father was brought to him. Because of his suffering, he had the riches. It is the same today in the church life. It is those who suffer who are able to give others <span class="pg" data-page-id="1526" id="1526">[1526]</span> the supply of life. This thought is found in the hymn regarding the grapevine (<em>Hymns,</em> #635). The last two stanzas were arranged by Brother Nee: </p>

Because the grapevine undergoes many sufferings, dealings, cuttings, and breakings, it produces rich wine to cheer man. Brother Nee realized that the more we suffer, the more we have to give. Without suffering, anything we say is like tinkling brass. We may make noise, but there is no life in what we say. Therefore, as this hymn says, our life is measured not by gain, but by loss. Therefore, the reason Joseph could be so rich was that he had suffered. During the years of his suffering he stored up the riches. </p>

It was not an easy task to store all that grain. For seven years Joseph gathered the grain and stored it in barns. This was a big job. On the one hand, Joseph was laboring; on the other hand, he was suffering because he was separated from his father.
