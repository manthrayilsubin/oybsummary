<p data-content-id="UReZhxCykc_InYnsNyIH2mb32T8lqabg_X4c1rM4tv3B_cwBUzM1RCsdLDVQTcDXS"> 1) David committed the greatest gross sin against God, and God forgave him after his repentance and gave him a son as God’s beloved, although God still disciplined him for the sake of His righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="MD9m-hm7lBelvrY99hJCQcgwePUT62lhdc2sHxtuFsDlpw2REjiR70CmpsT5YAzrf"> 2) Solomon insulted God with many idols through his many pagan wives and concubines, and because of this God cut away ten tribes from his kingdom but still left one tribe with him for David to have a lamp in Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="VqTM4j7jhJnStBxLc7-aLtwefpSwnZOZKJRuyeoMI_jUh8deeBdi5U8fdKTm28DBQ"> 3) The children of Israel forsook God and went after idols, so God dispersed them into all the nations yet, in His eternal love, would bring them back to their fathers’ land in the last days. </p>
<p data-content-id="iPusj1bRzo11GF4HWORchWtpri_UKiJ2V80ajmVeRGSdBXUXtZBtQ-U1Br8-um-K-"> 4) God’s being so gracious to David, Solomon, and Israel was to keep the lineage of Christ’s genealogy that Christ might come into humanity and to keep a people to possess the land of Emmanuel that Christ may come to establish His kingdom on the earth. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Y6cqYS9dZCqXV3dxF6AiJp6_hLUg45QHEDB_cZSo8BPAPWcTPmUMrkT5B9eikqWbf">I. THE INTRINSIC REVELATION<br/>OF THE BOOKS OF HISTORY IN THE OLD TESTAMENT<br/>FROM JOSHUA TO ESTHER</h2><p data-content-id="E-2tgfnjVQJXB9ma_EpRPzcV803HXNTnV5l6uHDd8QRPbdOjCfZTBMbHO-UZ9kSf7"> This introductory word to the life-study of 1 and 2 Kings presents the intrinsic revelation of the books of history in the Old Testament. Such a revelation is necessary to get into the real significance of these books. Otherwise, we may regard these books merely as story books. <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="DsorH_xyoB78cab6FwCiJEXwmi64b2dPUCautuCjQthGcMRehcQwH3rSJA9Hoqb9F"> God promised Abraham that He would give him and his descendants Canaan as the good land. Through Moses He brought Israel as a people, the descendants of Abraham, out of Egypt through the wilderness to the border of the good land. After Moses, Joshua was used by God to bring His elect into the good land He had promised to them. </p>
<p data-content-id="SGaXi7njwfYWpU1WQOEqzWNUwZIZUzOKUmpfmdtA5vw0BIlqt54fcVPkK02NI4qw-"> The intrinsic revelation of the history according to the record from Joshua to Esther is to unveil to us how the eternal economy of God was carried out by His elect on the earth. The eternal economy of God is altogether concerning Christ and for Christ, mainly in the person of Christ and the kingdom of Christ. Regarding the person of Christ, the record of history in the Old Testament keeps a lineage of the genealogy of Christ for His coming through His incarnation to be a man. Regarding the kingdom of Christ, the Old Testament history keeps a line on the kingdom of God for Christ to establish His divine kingdom on the earth. These two items form the governing line of the divine revelation in the books of the history of Israel. Now in 1 and 2 Kings this governing line must be realized by us for our study and understanding of these two books. </p>
<p data-content-id="g8naZMXLGRbPf0CdoIr6ZVVl85rmd6PsjZqhYVsmAPBp6hEyJVsA7w_mXHcSb3L5G"> For the carrying out of His economy, God needs a people and a land. For Christ’s person, there is the need of a people to be the lineage of His genealogy to bring Him into humanity. For Christ’s kingdom, there is the need of a land. Although the earth was created by God, it has been usurped by Satan. Thus, God uses His people to gain a part of the Satan-usurped earth to serve as a “beachhead” for Him to set up His kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="egj5V2w1QTSssfpZlA_fn2Eclkql8YLPSNoH0vBuiMbHm40Noyl2hwQ-DK3EJeeoR"> The Bible is not a book of history. The Bible is the record of the divine revelation concerning God’s eternal economy, of which Christ is the center and reality. Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, and the church is the organic Body of Christ. These two items are the basic structure of the Bible. So, in understanding any book of the Bible, we should hold this point of view, especially in the life-study of the books of Kings. Apparently, these two books are the history of the kings of Israel. Actually, they are books written in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> inspiration of the Spirit of God in the way of being related to God’s eternal economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="5b5kyHqvC7pEaEM0rof9ATOyGha94SF3zuRTko_NQMhQjPfbxF7eORGDj5ZIK368O"> The first two kings, David and Solomon, are important types of Christ in two aspects. The first aspect is that of His suffering on earth, before His resurrection. From the time of His birth, He suffered. His life began in a manger in the lowest estate and ended in His being crucified on the cross. The manger and the cross were the two ends of His suffering life. David typifies this suffering Christ. David also suffered from his youth. Yet his suffering was for the conquering of the usurping enemies and the gaining of the good land, the ground for God’s building. Solomon typifies the Christ glorified in the kingdom of God and its splendor. Solomon was glorified in the kingdom of Israel with the splendor of that kingdom. This is a prefigure of Christ in the millennium. These two types are strong evidences that the history of the kings of Israel is related to God’s eternal economy, which concerns Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the organic Body of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NTRVFJxps-8cPJeQQ-MRIIow6sBYOJEJ5PM9hrWV-18GtCkdqZHmkjQHWtWo5hLJc">II. THE MAIN STRIKING POINT<br/>OF THE HISTORICAL BOOKS CONCERNING ISRAEL</h2><p data-content-id="tpzx9piYNvlSlo1yFKzDEu1pCxr9IzR-o2_WUk-QdfT4gVIqpe2rDB-cy-49mQNkW"> The main striking point of these historical books concerning Israel is to show us in detail, in the way of typology, how to experience Christ as the good land given to us by God as our portion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45532" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">Col. 1:12</span>). First, the book of Joshua shows us how to gain, to take possession of, and to keep the good land. Then the books of Judges, Ruth, and 1 and 2 Samuel give us pictures of certain persons, showing us how they remained in the good land and enjoyed the good land after they took possession of it. The record of quite a few judges in the book of Judges, of Ruth and Boaz in the book of Ruth, and of Eli, Samuel, Saul, Jonathan, and David in the books of 1 and 2 Samuel presents us vivid pictures of how those persons remained in and enjoyed the good land. Even though those pictures were painted in detail, there is still the need of 1 and 2 Kings to give us pictures of more persons showing us how they remained in and enjoyed the good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="h_0bVwEhWSCYzOJHr6xiqf7tYUaAwnDvHIXoMNNAKFWMp_5gfComcqpkB4T6iJFZr"> Christ is the good land given to us by God, and we need to <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> enjoy this good land. We should ask ourselves how much we have enjoyed Christ. It is not sufficient simply to experience Christ; we must also enjoy Christ. Have you enjoyed Christ today? I can testify that today I have enjoyed Christ as my life supply, my strength, my living faith, my joy, and my peace. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UReZhxCykc_InYnsNyIH2mb32T8lqabg_X4cx5s4tv3B_cwBUzM1RCsdLDVQTcDXS">III. THE TWO BOOKS OF KINGS PRESENTING US<br/>A FULL PICTURE OF THE DETAILS<br/>BY WHICH GOD’S ELECT REMAINED IN<br/>AND PARTICIPATED IN THE GOOD LAND</h2><p data-content-id="MD9m-hm7lBelvrY99hJCQcgwePUT62lhdc2sCjduFsDlpw2REjiR70CmpsT5YAzrf"> The two books of Kings present us a full picture of the details by which God’s elect remained in and participated in the good land. It depicts, as an x-ray, in detail, the character, the intention, the preferences, the habits, the morality, and the actions of all the kings as the descendants of David the king. By such a picture we can see that what we are, what we desire, what we intend to do, what we want, and how we behave ourselves have very much to do with our remaining in Christ and participating in all His unsearchable riches for our enjoyment. This picture concerning Israel ends with a tragedy of all the kings who were put into the blessed situation of the Davidic kingship and who were not faithful to God and did not take good care of their inheritance: they lost the good land and were carried away as captives to the idol-worshipping world. This should be a solemn alarm and warning to us in our relationship with Christ. If we are wrong in any of the matters mentioned above, we will suffer the loss of Christ as our enjoyment. I hope that we all will see this and be deeply impressed with it. </p>
<p data-content-id="VqTM4j7jhJnStBxLc7-aLtwefpSwnZOZKJRu4MoMI_jUh8deeBdi5U8fdKTm28DBQ"> Christ is our good land, and we need to remain in this land, participate in it, and enjoy it. But the enjoyment of Christ has been very much neglected by the believers. For instance, many believers can testify that they have prayed and that their prayers have been answered by God. However, not many can say that in receiving an answer to their prayers they enjoyed Christ. This indicates we can pray and receive an answer without having any enjoyment of Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> </p>

BEING OLD AND FADING AWAY</h2><p data-content-id="siMDAOR7eJsb4SvP-2zSzJQpB360I8MOxbPyYSRuWOa4ijXRfK-o-IaUjcXv2csxF"> David not only became old but was also fading away. To fade away is different from being old, which is common. David’s life had a good beginning, like the bright sun rising, and his life with his career became like the sun shining at noon. However, his indulgence in lust spoiled his career and caused his bright life to fade like the sunset in the evening. In David’s old age there was nothing bright, excellent, or splendid. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wv5uyp_UTeHk4zUSNS_At94PQgr_dm0-BvBtrEKoUaRfyqpgxWGukRpNOKiXAMaYF">II. MAKING SOLOMON THE SUCCESSOR TO HIS THRONE</h2><p data-content-id="LR3U_Bt1Ve8F6KkcnT5OeFm7PuxB-CdvniXp2eoXxNKSF4giFtlr9xqNZLlzU0zJT"> David made Solomon the successor to his throne (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45541" data-verses="1Kings 1:5-53">1:5-53</span>). However, Solomon’s source was David’s indulgence of lust. Solomon’s mother was the wife of Uriah, a Gentile leader of David’s army. David murdered Uriah and took his wife. As David was appointing Solomon as his successor, he could not have felt glorious. David’s appointing of Solomon was strong evidence of God’s forgiveness and unlimited grace, but David nevertheless must have felt a sense of shame about it. </p>
<p data-content-id="fIZJgE0q6aPZi_O0_1W9drcSARjxXY2lO21Be_2NWjcpryt0PHDezaSXiMuCR5wfV"> Joab, the captain of David’s army, who participated in Uriah’s murder, might never have lost his negative feeling about David’s sin. It might have been because of this that Joab joined Adonijah in his rebellion. By this we can see that our sinning is not a light matter. It spoils everything. David’s indulgence greatly spoiled his name, his position, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="8" id="8">[8]</span> even his ending. This was the fading, the sunset, of David’s life. </p>
<p data-content-id="IaztqgIa9ySECwbN7-cp4V0KFQsYGwpdgO9Ms6eS9kW7MnuA3RdHxl6hUtdup0yLU"> David’s indulgence became a seed which issued in the tragedy of the loss of the good land and the capture of the holy people. The effects of this tragedy have lasted even until today. This should serve as a warning to all the young people among us. We must not contact the other sex in a light way. As brothers and sisters in the church we cannot avoid contacting one another, but we must always keep a distance from the other sex. David’s indulgence in sin began with just one look. His one glance caused him to fall to such an extent with such a tragic result. </p>

David’s concern here indicates that while he was on his deathbed he had no peace or comfort in his heart. His dealing with these persons was the issue of his indulgence in sin. God forgave him, but God’s righteous judgment would not let him go. </p>

He was buried in the city of David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45565" data-verses="1Kings 2:10">v. 10</span>), after reigning over Israel for forty years: seven years in Hebron over Judah and thirty-three years in Jerusalem over the entire people of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45566" data-verses="1Kings 2:11">v. 11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="g8naZMXLGRbPf0CdoIr6ZVVl85rmd6PsjZahdUMmAPBp6hEyJVsA7w_mXHcSb3L5G"> According to what David had done for Israel, the people should have taken action, at the time of his death, to remember him. However, contrary to what we might expect, the Bible does not give us a vivid record telling us that at his death the people expressed their appreciation of him. Rather, <span class="pg" data-page-id="11" id="11">[11]</span> the record of the end of David’s life on earth is dim and gloomy. This indicates that the indulgence of David’s lust spoiled his splendid life. Moreover, the sins committed by Solomon and the thirty-eight kings after him can be traced to David’s indulgence. His one indulgence resulted in the loss of the God-given good land by his descendants and in the spoiling of God’s chosen people. </p>
<p data-content-id="egj5V2w1QTSssfpZlA_fn2Eclkql8YLPSNYHxuhuiMbHm40Noyl2hwQ-DK3EJeeoR"> Although the ending of David’s life was sad, God’s sovereignty nevertheless overcame Satan’s subtlety. God still carried out the return from captivity in order to preserve fourteen generations of Christ’s genealogy. By the return from captivity the good land was recovered. God still carried out His intention to bring Himself in His Trinity into humanity and to set up His spiritual kingdom. </p>

Those who know something about the Bible and even the worldly people appraise Solomon very highly. On the one hand, I also appreciate Solomon. On the other hand, because I have seen the intrinsic revelation in the Scriptures, I feel sorry for Solomon, who eventually had a great failure. He was a wise king, and the nations came to listen to his word of wisdom. The reign of Solomon was, therefore, a time of glory and splendor. But Solomon loved many foreign women; he had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, and he built worship places for them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45569" data-verses="1Kings 11:1-8">1 Kings 11:1-8</span>). Such a thing, which is beyond our understanding, led to the loss of the good land. </p>

Actually, he had no peace. In human history it is difficult to find a case like David’s son Absalom’s rebellion against his father. This was God’s chastising hand over David. On the one hand, God forgave David, but on the other hand, He disciplined and chastised David according to His governmental righteousness. </p>

God gave him very much understanding and largeness of heart, even as the sand on the seashore (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45641" data-verses="1Kings 4:29">v. 29</span>). Solomon, therefore, had a large heart. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45642" data-verses="1Kings 4:30-31">verses 30 and 31</span> his wisdom surpassed that of all the wise men of the east and of Egypt, including Ethan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45643" data-verses="Psalms 89:1">Psa. 89</span> title) and Heman (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45644" data-verses="Psalms 88:1">Psa. 88</span> title), the Ezrahites.

Solomon sent 30,000 levied forced laborers, 70,000 burden bearers, 80,000 stonecutters, and 3,300 chief officers to cooperate with Hiram’s builders. The Gebalites (a people in the territory of Lebanon) participated in the preparation of the timber and the stones (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45658" data-verses="1Kings 5:18">v. 18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="DsorH_xyoB78cab6FwCiJEXwmi64b2dPUDKuvuCjQthGcMRehcQwH3rSJA9Hoqb9F"> We should not overly appreciate Solomon’s glory. The Lord Jesus said of the lilies of the field, “I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45659" data-verses="Matthew 6:29">Matt. 6:29</span>), and Peter said, “All flesh is like grass, and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass has withered, and the flower has fallen off” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45660" data-verses="1Peter 1:24">1 Pet. 1:24</span>). Solomon himself eventually admitted that what he had and did was vanity of vanities (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45661" data-verses="Ecclesiastes 1:2">Eccl. 1:2</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="SGaXi7njwfYWpU1WQOEqzWNUwZIZUzOKUn5fkdtA5vw0BIlqt54fcVPkK02NI4qw-"> In order that we may have the proper appreciation of Solomon, I would like to point out that the Bible is composed of two sections. The first section, the Old Testament, contains types, shadows, and figures. The reality of the types, shadows, and figures is in the second section, the New Testament. Solomon’s wisdom was a shadow of the real wisdom which was to come. </p>
<p data-content-id="g8naZMXLGRbPf0CdoIr6ZVVl85rmd6PsjY6haVsmAPBp6hEyJVsA7w_mXHcSb3L5G"> In the transition period between these two sections, the Lord Jesus said, “Among those born of women there has not arisen one greater than John the Baptist, yet he who is least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45662" data-verses="Matthew 11:11">Matt. 11:11</span>). John the Baptist, a pioneer of the New Testament age, was greater than Solomon, but as New Testament believers we are greater still. This means that, in God’s economy, we are greater than Solomon. No matter how much God did for Solomon and how much He gave him, Solomon did not have God Himself wrought into him. But we have God in Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="25" id="25">[25]</span> wrought into us that we might be the same as God in life and in nature. We may not have what Solomon had outwardly as a type, but within us there is a reality—the very God in Christ who has wrought Himself into our being. We may regard ourselves as insignificant, but we have God in Christ wrought into us. As those who have been born of God to be God’s children, God’s kind, members of God’s family, we have become God in life and in nature (but not in the Godhead). We were born into mankind, but we have been regenerated, transformed, and uplifted to be another kind. We are not just men in the new creation; we are God-men. </p>
<p data-content-id="egj5V2w1QTSssfpZlA_fn2Eclkql8YLPSM4H2vBuiMbHm40Noyl2hwQ-DK3EJeeoR"> At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45663" data-verses="Matthew 11:1">Matthew 11</span>, the disciples could not have fully understood the Lord’s word concerning John the Baptist. Later He told them that the Spirit of reality would come and disclose all things to them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45664" data-verses="John 16:12-15">John 16:12-15</span>). The mysteries of God’s economy were disclosed mainly to Paul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45665" data-verses="Ephesians 3:3-5">Eph. 3:3-5</span>). This is why the writings of Paul occupy such a large part of the New Testament. Today, if we would know the highest wisdom in the universe, we must come to Paul’s Epistles. We must get into the intrinsic significance of the revelation of the Bible, especially the crystallization of the truths in Paul’s Epistles. The real wisdom is God, and God is embodied in Christ, who has become our wisdom to be in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45666" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:24">1 Cor. 1:24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45667" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">30</span>), making us one with God and making us God in life and in nature. What a wisdom this is! </p>

God’s heart was on His kingdom with His home. However, there was not a person who would take care of God’s heart’s desire until David. David was a man according to God’s desire to build up a kingdom and to have a house built up for Himself on the earth. Although this building began in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, everything for the building up of the temple was prepared by David. </p>

He prayed that in the captivity of His people Jehovah would hear His people’s prayer and maintain their cause when they would return to Him with all their heart and with all their soul and pray to Him toward the land that He had given to their fathers, toward the city that He had chosen, and toward the house that Solomon had built for His name, that they could be separated from all the peoples of the earth to be His inheritance. </p>
<p data-content-id="AsrsnVDewhN_xkUk_WTlU5wiVSHlN_BSG0XvaBXao4LAH-PwrvA1skXIGl89AeR4K"> In the last of the seven conditions concerning God’s listening to the prayers of His elect, three things are stressed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45752" data-verses="1Kings 8:48">v. 48</span>): the holy land, typifying Christ as God’s allotted portion <span class="pg" data-page-id="39" id="39">[39]</span> to the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45753" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">Col. 1:12</span>); the holy city, signifying the kingdom of God in Christ; and the holy temple, signifying God’s house, the church, on the earth. These three things—the holy land, the holy city, and the holy temple—are the three crucial things regarding God’s economy. During the Babylonian captivity Daniel prayed for the holy land, the holy city, and the holy temple three times a day by opening his window toward Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45754" data-verses="Daniel 6:10">Dan. 6:10</span>). This indicates that God will listen to our prayer in the way that our prayer to God must be toward Christ, the kingdom of God, and the house of God as the goal in God’s eternal economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="FcpF1-uvIVoxNzmD74ZJcPGQURXNFQeSSejICX5S-q0qbmFblc2GMguTSR9KWNqKz"> The holy land, the holy city, and the holy temple are all types of Christ. Christ is our good land; Christ is our city, our kingdom; and Christ is the temple, God’s dwelling place. Today, our prayers should be aimed at the holy land, the holy city, and the holy temple. This means that our prayers should be aimed at the interest of God, that is, at Christ and the church as God’s interest on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="CopVEflapt7_izv_cR_NmTtN8zGT98EwhUOMmcRMO4EuVQCM3-C7K6--k2Z2UmUGk"> The spiritual significance of God’s interest is Christ Himself. This indicates that no matter for whom we are praying, our prayer must be aimed at Christ as God’s interest. We need to pray for the saints, but we should not aim our prayers at them. On the one hand we pray for them, but on the other hand we pray for them because of God’s interest. If in our prayer we aim at the one for whom we pray, this will bring in the enemy’s attack. This is a spiritual strategy in the spiritual warfare. </p>
<p data-content-id="P3imRn1sndybd3IvEJwSbNLp0ystpt_zL7M1mNpbJU2eooXgH4h3_VE3BeZdhft9I"> We need to remember that prayer involves three parties: us, God, and Satan. Sometimes when we pray for a certain person, Satan comes to attack him, and his situation becomes worse. The reason for this is that our interest is in that person, not in God’s economy. No matter for whom we are praying, we should aim our prayer at God’s Christ, who is God’s interest in His economy. </p>

However, what God did through him as a <span class="pg" data-page-id="47" id="47">[47]</span> type of Christ remains forever.

<p data-content-id="9yJu3sUX1aSRy4BVWbdnBhujNKEI0LfQOMl8lKvzP4ABqbbknBuM0rocFN3k2In6q"> There are many different ways of understanding the Bible. Brother Nee said that the kind of Bible you have is according to the kind of person you are. Every denomination and group has its own way of understanding the Bible. The Pentecostals know the Bible in their way, interpreting it without any governing principles. Roman Catholics know the Bible according to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. The inner-life people understand the Bible in their particular way. Fifty years ago Brother Nee and I considered the Brethren teachings to be the best, and during the years I have often consulted John Nelson Darby’s <em>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible.</em> But in the past few years, in preparing for the life-studies on Job and the books of history, I did not consult the Brethren teachings. In these years the Lord has shown us something higher and more profound—God’s eternal economy, the center and reality of which are Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God and the church as the organic Body of Christ. For the carrying out of His economy, God is dispensing Himself into us. </p>
<p data-content-id="j_CAadPFNO4A1E01s9-yVTnjJo75hjUv6gRvuCMmYWLwBKShUCMtXQmMNCo5hkeva"> The divine dispensing is revealed in the book of Ephesians. The Brethren stress God’s choosing and predestinating us in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45804" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span>, yet they do not point out that God’s selection and predestination are organic matters. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45805" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4">Verse 4</span> says that God has chosen us in Christ to be holy. To be holy means to be God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. In the entire universe, only God is holy. God can make us holy only <span class="pg" data-page-id="50" id="50">[50]</span> by dispensing His holy nature—that is, His holy element—into our being. When God regenerated us, He dispensed Himself into us as the holy element. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45806" data-verses="Ephesians 1:5">Verse 5</span> says that God predestinated us unto sonship. This means that God has predestinated us to be His sons by dispensing. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45807" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span> the church is the issue of the Triune God’s dispensing and the ascended Christ’s transfusing. In the last ten years the Lord has brought me to understand the Bible in this way. </p>
<p data-content-id="TTZXJUkzW1cuaaSl53CxwwdPRoZSH7lrbZI35gFaRs-xDsy9NQE2zK1c49sRXbeFw"> Nearly all fundamental teachings are good. We appreciate these teachings and have built upon them. However, they have also delayed us and veiled us. Many fundamental teachers have become contented with the fundamental teachings, and we also have become somewhat contented with our understanding of the Bible. If fundamental teachings become a tradition to us, we will not seek to improve our knowing of the Bible. Brother Nee was never content with these teachings. He always pioneered to see something further. </p>
<p data-content-id="nj6zEJge2Rvtt-lCzceJaAOc_DXaeWbUGtO4pLH36MQiIeScDtOBHLQPJ9YVI1AiD"> Our vision concerning the revelation of the Bible is that God wants to re-create man. Created man was not the goal of God’s purpose but only a step. God created man with His hand; He will re-create man with His life. He put created man in front of the tree of life, indicating that He wanted to re-create man by regenerating man. Eventually, the regenerated man becomes Christ’s bride and increase (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45808" data-verses="John 3:29-30">John 3:29-30</span>). Some Christians see regeneration in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45809" data-verses="John 3:1">John 3</span>, but they do not realize that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45810" data-verses="John 3:1">John 3</span> regeneration is for the producing of Christ’s bride and increase. This shows that there are different levels in understanding the Bible. </p>

We are very much for the preaching of the gospel by visiting sinners to bring them into Christ. However, the goal of our preaching is not to “win souls” or to bring people to heaven but to create, to produce, members of Christ for the building up of His organic Body, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="CopVEflapt7_izv_cR_NmTtN8zGT98EwhX-MrOxMO4EuVQCM3-C7K6--k2Z2UmUGk"> In doing this, our goal is to reach Zion, to have Zion today, for the fulfillment of God’s eternal economy. Otherwise, God will have no way to fulfill His economy to consummate in the New Jerusalem.

This Zion will be the standard of what the New Jerusalem will be. In the new heaven and new earth, when the New Jerusalem comes in, Zion will disappear because the entire New Jerusalem will become Zion, with all the believers as overcomers. The church life in the Lord’s recovery must go on and on until at least some of us, if not all, reach Zion. </p>

In the last ten years of my ministry, I have been struggling to reach this high point.

<p data-content-id="WqhNkU4mjezons9qT0QAv210WOF4-uSNuvxSET4iJBHA9hB_T3TEC2-BAAHMSTg35"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45942" data-verses="1Kings 18:1">chapter eighteen</span> Elijah had a great victory, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45943" data-verses="1Kings 19:1">chapter nineteen</span> he was fearful and escaped for his life. How could such a strong prophet be so weak after such a victory? In answering this question, I would like to compare Elijah with Paul. Nothing could threaten Paul. On the contrary, Paul was bold and ready to be martyred (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45944" data-verses="2Timothy 4:6-7">2 Tim. 4:6-7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45945" data-verses="2Timothy 4:17-18">17-18</span>). He took his martyrdom as an opportunity to magnify Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45946" data-verses="Philippians 1:20-21">Phil. 1:20-21</span>). The power of God was upon Elijah at times, but the Triune God Himself was continually wrought into Paul, constituting him to be God in life and in nature (but not in the Godhead). </p>
<p data-content-id="2Jdp93YRIpIT_rZQnTOu8IbmburTAa9lWGMvi377fXHQnCx4qlVABu93jpk8n1BW7"> Peter is another example of one who became weak. Concerning eating with the Gentiles, Peter did not keep the truth of the gospel due to his fear of his countrymen (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45947" data-verses="Galatians 2:11-14">Gal. 2:11-14</span>). Paul was bolder than Peter. Although Peter was under the Lord Jesus for three and a half years and received power from on high on the day of Pentecost, he did not have the Triune <span class="pg" data-page-id="69" id="69">[69]</span> God wrought into him to the degree that Paul did. Paul was thoroughly constituted with the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="uv29pzVJxWu1wfZ-J7ipJnYOfq-touh77uhMov3ll3pkz3FVNsZ3nC6CMylKBM0qW"> We all have Christ in us, but to what degree do we enjoy Christ constituting Himself into us day by day? Every day, moment by moment, the embodiment of the Triune God, our dear Lord Jesus Christ, is making His home in our hearts, constituting Himself into our being. However, in a matter such as talking with our spouse, we may fail to practice to enjoy Christ constituting Himself into us. </p>
<p data-content-id="fIZJgE0q6aPZi_O0_1W9drcSARjxXY2lP2VBb_WNWjcpryt0PHDezaSXiMuCR5wfV"> The forty kings of Israel and Judah were in the highest position, but they were not careful in their enjoyment of the good land. Not even David enjoyed the good land in full. We should apply their example to ourselves. After hearing many messages on the enjoyment of Christ, have we become careful in enjoying Christ? The words “the enjoyment of Christ” may merely be a teaching or a slogan to us. There is too little reality among us of the enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="IaztqgIa9ySECwbN7-cp4V0KFQsYGwpdhOdMp6-S9kW7MnuA3RdHxl6hUtdup0yLU"> This shortage can be seen in our contact with one another. We try not to be wrong and we stay away from sinful things, but we are not careful in our enjoyment of Christ. I can testify that during the twenty years I worked together with Watchman Nee, we never joked with each other and we were always kept in oneness, without arguing even a little. We were kept in this way because we both saw the vision concerning God’s economy and the Lord’s recovery, and we both learned how to live and have our being in the spirit and according to the spirit for our experience of Christ. </p>

The first step was from Gilgal to Bethel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46013" data-verses="2Kings 2:1-3">vv. 1-3</span>); the second step was from Bethel to Jericho (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46014" data-verses="2Kings 2:4-5">vv. 4-5</span>); and the third step was from Jericho to the river Jordan. Fifty sons (disciples) of the prophets went and stood opposite them at a distance. Elijah struck the water with his mantle, and the water parted so that he and Elisha crossed over on dry ground (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46015" data-verses="2Kings 2:6-8">vv. 6-8</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="P3imRn1sndybd3IvEJwSbNLp0ystpt_zK6M1hMJbJU2eooXgH4h3_VE3BeZdhft9I"> Elijah and Elisha are both types with much spiritual significance. Elijah is a type of the Old Testament age, and Elisha is a type of the New Testament age. The age was changed by passing through four places—Gilgal, Bethel, Jericho, and the river Jordan. </p>
<p data-content-id="-HfDqs344SdNa1_IMh3CEMROiSHDNCDxv3lfM3YYMskRzd9j1vGslXKThIbS0syRz"> Gilgal was a place where God’s people dealt with their flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46016" data-verses="Joshua 5:2-9">Josh. 5:2-9</span>). The children of those who came out of Egypt had not been circumcised, indicating that their flesh had never been dealt with. When they crossed the Jordan to begin fighting to gain the good land, they first dealt with their flesh by being circumcised at Gilgal. </p>
<p data-content-id="pdolUJ2HmRpxVWtqu1cBF0xAtjCo3ioJ61ih2f2Cj3yE8UJfvg9OJy_NuQ8xbwzvj"> From Gilgal Elijah and Elisha went to Bethel. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46017" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span>, when Abraham came out of Chaldea (giving up the world) and came to Bethel, he built an altar to offer everything to God. This indicates that Bethel is the place to give up the world and turn to God absolutely, taking God as everything. </p>
<p data-content-id="vWmD8DdEafJs2o-6B22ICMIptLAwySzQHdvGrUdMoVlHqr381RZi6fw9rBRoUc7KE"> Elijah then led Elisha to Jericho. The first city that Joshua and the people of Israel had to defeat when they entered into the good land was Jericho. Jericho signifies the head of God’s enemy, Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="WqhNkU4mjezons9qT0QAv210WOF4-uSNuvRSER4iJBHA9hB_T3TEC2-BAAHMSTg35"> Finally, Elijah and Elisha went to the river Jordan, which signifies death. The New Testament baptism, putting people into death, began from the Jordan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46018" data-verses="Matthew 3:5-6">Matt. 3:5-6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46019" data-verses="Matthew 3:13">13</span>). To cross the river Jordan, Elijah struck the water with his mantle. Elijah’s mantle typifies the outpoured Spirit, the Spirit of power. The Spirit of power, which some Bible teachers call the “mantle Spirit,” dealt with the river of death so that the way was opened for Elijah and Elisha to cross over. </p>
<p data-content-id="2Jdp93YRIpIT_rZQnTOu8IbmburTAa9lWGsvl3b7fXHQnCx4qlVABu93jpk8n1BW7"> As we consider the significance of all these types, we see that in order for the age to be changed from the Old Testament to the New Testament, we must deal with our flesh, give <span class="pg" data-page-id="82" id="82">[82]</span> up the world and turn to God, defeat Satan, and pass through death. </p>

<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="IaztqgIa9ySECwbN7-cp4V0KFQsYGwpdhO9Mu7eS9kW7MnuA3RdHxl6hUtdup0yLU">C.

Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven, and Elisha saw it and cried, “My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46021" data-verses="2Kings 2:11-12">vv. 11-12a</span>). Thus Elijah was taken up, leaving Elisha alone on the earth. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="XDw75jjQQzBsyAfLT8bSvncTb-7t8vGive0bdqEyDRSfoOa5QqU7QA7OBcABk9Ilq">D.

After Elijah was taken up, Elisha grasped his clothes and tore them in two pieces. Then he picked up Elijah’s mantle, which had fallen from him, returned and stood by the bank of the Jordan, and struck the water, saying, “Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46023" data-verses="2Kings 2:12-14">vv. 12b-14</span>). The water parted, and Elisha crossed over. When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho opposite him saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46024" data-verses="2Kings 2:15">v. 15</span>). Then fifty sons of the prophets attempted to seek Elijah for three days to no avail (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46025" data-verses="2Kings 2:16-18">vv. 16-18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="J2wR24KXWbSXodmVS0UuqfzbP81Q6_gKhCDYsTnEw13N3INVtLO29xsHi4Axmy-z3"> Elisha surely received the spirit of Elijah. However, as we will see, the Spirit, who at Elijah’s time performed great miracles such as shutting up the heavens, opening up the heavens, and calling down fire from heaven, acted in a different way through Elisha. Elisha behaved in a way which was very similar to that of the Lord Jesus in the Gospels, doing many gracious and sweet things. </p>
<p data-content-id="zIOrZuVsvO601ei-u5xMJiLrSN_VvsoU-l9UUQg179cbwS1E7oTG4kplGt3SsdIE-"> For three and a half years the Lord Jesus brought His disciples from the dealing with the flesh (Gilgal), to the giving <span class="pg" data-page-id="83" id="83">[83]</span> up of the world (Bethel), to the defeating of Satan, the head of the demons (Jericho). Eventually, the Lord Jesus brought His disciples to the river Jordan. The one hundred twenty who were praying in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46026" data-verses="Acts 1:1">Acts 1</span> had all been brought to the Jordan to die with Christ and to be buried with Him. I believe that, as a result, they no longer treasured what they were or what they could do but had torn this “into two pieces.” Through all these steps, they were in a position to receive the mantle of Elijah, the power from on high. Therefore, on the day of Pentecost the Spirit of power came upon them. Today we are those who are following the Lord Jesus from Gilgal to Bethel, from Bethel to Jericho, and from Jericho to the Jordan. Through all these steps we enter into a new age, the age of the New Testament, where Christ is doing gracious things. </p>
<p data-content-id="ahD-8XWRknLGNwstoDWGVZl-PQOwguoyQUuVWrSus5HLtZ0Zf_TwT0qWLZtw-5ZlY"> Elijah’s rapture typified the termination of the Old Testament age in God’s economy. But Elijah himself was not terminated. He was taken up into heaven to await the next age to see Elisha (Christ) doing many gracious and sweet things. We are now in the age of the New Testament of Christ, who did and is still doing everything graciously. </p>

Elijah did some great miracles, such as closing up the heavens so that it might not rain and calling down fire from heaven to consume the burnt offering and the water that had been poured upon it. However, when Elisha came in to replace him, he did not perform wonders. Instead, Elisha did miracles of grace in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="0O0K6SIo79Qa0jHNHq5d_wgjROSp2N9nAg45BVs9UXBR7e-hquxKfGwzgj-eqTsEM"> Many Christians pay attention to miracles, but they neglect the matters of grace and life or speak of them in a very shallow way. Paul emphasized grace very much in the book of Romans. In Romans justification by grace is unto the reigning in life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46041" data-verses="Romans 3:24">3:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46042" data-verses="Romans 5:17-18">5:17-18</span>). Grace in life is, therefore, a crucial matter in Romans. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ywcMHRtzc1rxQf13F-g5qzZJSwclTXFc_bIFLpvHjgCqtp6wSnZ0MXHbG_Ovs1cJ"> Grace is God doing everything for us by giving Himself to us as our enjoyment. This grace issues in the divine life, which is rich and high, even unto making us co-kings with Christ. However, among today’s Christians it is not likely that <span class="pg" data-page-id="86" id="86">[86]</span> one will hear a message telling the believers that God’s grace issues in the divine life for us to reign as kings. </p>

Healing the Bad Water of Jericho</h2><p data-content-id="BIq0MD3Ozo9flvMzyFdDmB4IzSQk3fMgr-LbzKBkdN01lLY2frQ-JTRG-vMGYKGAO"> First, Elisha healed the bad water of Jericho (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46043" data-verses="2Kings 2:19-22">2 Kings 2:19-22</span>). When the men of the city told Elisha that the water was bad and that the land was barren, he went out to the source of the water and threw salt there, saying, “Thus says Jehovah, I have healed this water; there will not be any more death or barrenness from there” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46044" data-verses="2Kings 2:21">v. 21</span>). Jericho signifies Satan, and with Satan everything is death, including the water. But the bad water of Jericho was healed according to the word of Elisha and became good water, water that gave life. </p>
<p data-content-id="xv-vm4Ni513CaOWkPWWMBY3HgFndo86ALEfCZFkgqnzQMdDFafL9Ys2k0nYUsHgp7"> The first miracle the Lord Jesus performed in the Gospel of John was the changing of water into wine (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46045" data-verses="John 2:3-11">2:3-11</span>). The significance of this miracle is the changing of death into life. Changing death into life is the governing principle of all the Lord’s miracles in the Gospel of John and of all the cases dealt with by Him in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46046" data-verses="John 3:1">chapters three through eleven</span> of John.

We have recommended certain writings by Andrew Murray, Madame Guyon, Brother Lawrence, and others. We have especially recommended Andrew Murray’s masterpiece <em>The Spirit of Christ,</em> as well as <em>God’s Plan of Redemption</em> by Mary E. McDonough and <em>Life on the Highest Plane</em> by Ruth Paxson. Among us we also have the ministry of Brother Nee. Brother Nee’s ministry was rejected by the Western missionaries in his youth, but today his ministry is known by seeking Christians throughout the world. By the Lord’s mercy and grace, in the last seventy years nearly all the crucial, important revelations of the Bible have been covered in Watchman Nee’s ministry and my ministry. I would urge you to pay attention to these pure and healthy things and not waste your time collecting “poisonous gourds.” </p>

The prophet Elisha represents God’s New Testament economy in typology. Elisha was a type in the Old Testament who typified the real things in the New Testament. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46078" data-verses="Luke 4:27">Luke 4:27</span> the Lord Jesus referred to Elisha as a type of Himself, saying, “There were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them were cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian.” Here the Lord indicated that Israel’s rejection of Elisha and Elisha’s turn to the Gentiles was a type of Himself as the Son of Man. This offended those in the synagogue, and they cast Him out. This fulfilled the type of Elisha, who came to God’s people with the word of grace but was rejected by them. Christ also was rejected and forced to turn to the Gentiles to preach the word of grace. </p>

<p data-content-id="siMDAOR7eJsb4SvP-2zSzJQpB360I8MOwa_yaSRuWOa4ijXRfK-o-IaUjcXv2csxF"> We have strongly pointed out that the Old Testament history is very much related to God’s economy in the way of typology. If we read the books of history in the Old Testament without knowing the typology, we will not understand these books. In 2 Kings two persons—Elisha and Jezebel—are striking types of certain real things in the New Testament. Whereas Elisha was a very sweet person, Jezebel was most evil. In this message on the reigns of Jehoram and Ahaziah over Judah and the reign of Jehu over Israel, we will see the destruction of Jezebel. </p>
<p data-content-id="wv5uyp_UTeHk4zUSNS_At94PQgr_dm0-AuxtlEKoUaRfyqpgxWGukRpNOKiXAMaYF"> Both the Old Testament in typology and the New Testament in fulfillment speak of Jezebel. The evil of Jezebel, a most hateful person, is like the evil of Satan. Many people have been poisoned, cheated, veiled, and usurped by her. </p>
<p data-content-id="LR3U_Bt1Ve8F6KkcnT5OeFm7PuxB-Cdvmjnp4eoXxNKSF4giFtlr9xqNZLlzU0zJT"> The Jezebel of the Old Testament was a type and a shadow. It is important for us to see who Jezebel is in the New Testament reality. Jezebel, the pagan wife of Ahab, is a type of the apostate church. Christianity is the biggest religion on earth, and the greatest part of this religion is today’s Jezebel, the apostate Roman Catholic Church. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46118" data-verses="Revelation 2:24">Revelation 2:24</span> the Lord Jesus said that Jezebel teaches the “deep things of Satan.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46119" data-verses="Matthew 13:33">Matthew 13:33</span> this same woman mixed leaven, the element of Satan, with fine flour, which signifies the Lord Jesus as the meal offering for the satisfaction of God and man. Jezebel, the apostate church, teaches the deity of Christ but has mixed much leaven with the teaching of the divine person of Christ. With Jezebel, therefore, there is one part <span class="pg" data-page-id="96" id="96">[96]</span> truth and many parts leaven. Vast regions of the earth are under her influence. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46120" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">Revelation 17</span> this woman is the great harlot who mixes abominations with the divine things. </p>

Division comes out of people’s ambition, that is, the desire to be higher than others, to be the head, the ruler, and the king of the people. </p>
<p data-content-id="_q_ZUWWVmyuHLTXGG8XneWtB5pGtRASHzrVbKDXlBOaxbp12vaBASK2YmhwcZKvVl"> In the New Testament the oneness of the Body of Christ is stressed very much. According to the Gospels, the followers of the Lord Jesus loved Him to the uttermost, giving up their country, home, and relatives to follow Him for three and a half years. During that time the most pressing issue among them was the matter of who would be greatest. Even during the final trip to Jerusalem, when the Lord Jesus was burdened to tell them once again about His crucifixion, they quarreled over who would be the greatest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46174" data-verses="Matthew 20:20-28">Matt. 20:20-28</span>; cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46175" data-verses="Luke 22:24">Luke 22:24</span>). The mother of the sons of Zebedee, James and John, came to Him with her sons and asked that they would sit, one on His right and one on His left, in His kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46176" data-verses="Matthew 20:20-21">Matt. 20:20-21</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="BIq0MD3Ozo9flvMzyFdDmB4IzSQk3fMgr_bbxKBkdN01lLY2frQ-JTRG-vMGYKGAO"> In His last night on earth, the Lord Jesus spoke to His disciples at length of the depths of the divine revelation concerning God’s economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46177" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14—16</span>). Following this, He offered a concluding prayer to the Father in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46178" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span>. In this prayer He repeatedly asked the Father to keep all the believers in the oneness of the Triune God. The Lord Jesus prayed for them based upon the life of the Triune God, the name of the Father, the truths concerning God’s economy, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="104" id="104">[104]</span> the glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46179" data-verses="John 17:11">vv. 11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46180" data-verses="John 17:17">17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46181" data-verses="John 17:21-23">21-23</span>). From that time the disciples became faithful followers of the Lord. After His resurrection and ascension, they even stayed together in Jerusalem and prayed for ten days in one accord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46182" data-verses="Acts 1:14">Acts 1:14</span>). When the Lord was poured out upon them as the Spirit at Pentecost, the church life began. However, division gradually came in. </p>
<p data-content-id="xv-vm4Ni513CaOWkPWWMBY3HgFndo86ALFPCbFkgqnzQMdDFafL9Ys2k0nYUsHgp7"> I would ask you to consider, according to the New Testament, what was the first division to invade the church. I believe that the first division came in when Barnabas left Paul. After Saul—later Paul—was saved directly by the Lord and baptized by Ananias, Barnabas brought him into the fellowship of the Body. The believers in Jerusalem were afraid of Saul because he had been a persecutor and a devastator of the church, but Barnabas was bold to bring him to Jerusalem and recommend him to the apostles to be brought into the fellowship of the Body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46183" data-verses="Acts 9:26-28">Acts 9:26-28</span>). Later, Paul and Barnabas, intimately related, were among the prophets and teachers in Antioch (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46184" data-verses="Acts 13:1">13:1</span>) and were eventually sent out by the Holy Spirit for the work to which He had called them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46185" data-verses="Acts 13:2">v. 2</span>). When they first went out together, Barnabas’s name was mentioned first (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46186" data-verses="Acts 13:7">v. 7</span>). But at Paphos a situation arose which required a stronger speaker, and Paul took the lead to speak (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46187" data-verses="Acts 13:8-12">vv. 8-12</span>). This indicated that, although previously Barnabas had been taking the lead, he was not as adequate as Paul, who now took the lead to speak. From that time Paul’s name always came before Barnabas’s in the divine revelation. For a time Paul and Barnabas worked together quite well. Later, Paul proposed to Barnabas that they visit the churches that had been raised up. Barnabas first proposed and then insisted on bringing his cousin Mark. Paul did not feel good about this because Mark, unable to bear the hardships of the journey, had retreated on their first trip. Because of this disagreement, Barnabas left Paul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46188" data-verses="Acts 15:36-39">15:36-39</span>). After that, there is no mention of these two being together again. That was a division. </p>
<p data-content-id="rYS4uRkJ8OLy9ibPotRct8IfRiKLsIWnkmp3XwOcHVZGrsXTeWbv9X0_3eFSXvYmP"> In serving the Lord in the Body of Christ, our heart must be single and pure. There was something not so single and pure, perhaps something of ambition, in the heart of Barnabas. This issued in division. <span class="pg" data-page-id="105" id="105">[105]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="dOmxOgI2XBToZRRpQAgQ9edq39D8j1bThfUfLqXktI5_naDB4ggJVK9P_GAyMFbjL"> Division became a problem to the apostles, who endeavored to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ. A division rose up in Corinth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46189" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:10-12">1 Cor. 1:10-12</span>), and Paul wrote to the church there concerning it. When Paul wrote to the church in Ephesus, he said that the first virtue of the believers’ conduct is to keep the oneness of the Spirit, that is, to keep the oneness of the Body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46190" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1-3">Eph. 4:1-3</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="QORuMzNaOvDPCW6h2LwnHnA5VyPiwbiAj79OftxqV7HB2YqTUhmVq1Gmthnc91b7n"> Throughout the centuries of church history, there has been division after division. During the past seventy years there have also been some divisions among us. According to my observation, every division is due to ambition. As a warning, I must tell you that in the past seventy years of the Lord’s recovery no one who has created a division has ever repented. This is a very serious matter. </p>

These people did not fear Jehovah and were punished by Jehovah with lions. Then the king of Assyria used a Jewish priest to teach the heathens the customs of Israel and the things concerning God. Eventually, these heathens intermarried with the Jews who remained in Israel. As a result, a confused and mixed worship was produced, such as that referred to by the Samaritan woman in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46300" data-verses="John 4:20">John 4:20</span>. This confusion and mixture may be regarded as a type of the kind of worship, found especially in Catholicism, that is a mixture of the worship of God with heathen practices and the pagan worship of idols. </p>
<p data-content-id="CopVEflapt7_izv_cR_NmTtN8zGT98EwgX-MgcRMO4EuVQCM3-C7K6--k2Z2UmUGk"> At this juncture I would like to say a word concerning God’s economy. Christ’s incarnation and redemption constitute the first part of the fulfillment of God’s economy as typified in the books of history in the Old Testament. In his prophecy Isaiah refers us to Christ’s incarnation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46301" data-verses="Isaiah 7:14">7:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46302" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">9:6</span>) and Christ’s redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46303" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">ch. 53</span>). Christ came as God becoming a man, a God-man with two natures—the divine nature and the human nature. After going into death, He entered into resurrection, and in resurrection He accomplished many things. He brought His humanity into divinity, being designated the firstborn Son of God with His humanity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46304" data-verses="Romans 1:4">Rom. 1:4</span>). In Christ’s resurrection all of God’s chosen people were regenerated together with Christ and in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46305" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="P3imRn1sndybd3IvEJwSbNLp0ystpt_zK481gNpbJU2eooXgH4h3_VE3BeZdhft9I"> In resurrection Christ also became the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46306" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>) as the consummation of the Triune God. This divine, all-inclusive Spirit enters into our spirit and mingles with our regenerated spirit, causing God and man, man and God, to become one in the mingled spirit. The two spirits are now mingled together as one entity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46307" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46308" data-verses="Romans 8:16">Rom. 8:16</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="128" id="128">[128]</span> This mingled spirit is the beginning of the Body of Christ and will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Today we need to care for this mingled spirit. If we are not clear concerning this but instead, like Judaism and Christianity, pay our attention to outward things, we will be distracted, even deceived and seduced, from the central matter in God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="-HfDqs344SdNa1_IMh3CEMROiSHDNCDxv1VfN14YMskRzd9j1vGslXKThIbS0syRz"> Christ today is the heavenly High Priest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46309" data-verses="Hebrews 4:14">Heb. 4:14</span>), a Minister in the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46310" data-verses="Hebrews 8:1-2">8:1-2</span>), the Mediator of a new covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46311" data-verses="Hebrews 9:15">9:15</span>), and the Executor of the new testament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46312" data-verses="Hebrews 9:16-17">9:16-17</span>). As such, He is working not only in the heavens but also in our regenerated spirit, bringing heaven to us and joining us to heaven. The way for us to follow Christ is to remain, live, walk, and have our being in the mingled spirit. This spontaneously causes us to live Christ, magnify Christ, and be one with Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46313" data-verses="Philippians 1:20-21">Phil. 1:20-21</span>). The issue of such a life is the Body of Christ, the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="pdolUJ2HmRpxVWtqu1cBF0xAtjCo3ioJ63Sh3dWCj3yE8UJfvg9OJy_NuQ8xbwzvj"> We should do everything, great or small, in and according to the mingled spirit, always checked by the regulations of the Bible. The Bible’s teaching urges and inspires us to live in the spirit, to walk in the spirit, and to do everything according to the spirit. For instance, the way we style our hair and the way we speak with our spouse and children should be according to the spirit. When we visit others for the preaching of the gospel, we should contact them not according to our self but according to the mingled spirit. Furthermore, in the church meetings our singing, praying, praising, and prophesying should all be in the spirit and according to the spirit. </p>

Also, he broke in pieces the bronze serpent made by Moses which Hezekiah called Nehushtan (meaning “a piece of bronze”) and to which the children of Israel burned incense. Moses, according to God’s instructions, had made that bronze serpent in order to rescue the people from death. However, in their superstition they eventually regarded the bronze serpent as an idol, and for this reason Hezekiah broke it in pieces. Hezekiah clung to Jehovah and did not turn away from following Him but kept His commandments and trusted in Him, so that after him there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, nor anyone who was before him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="132" id="132">[132]</span> </p>

The history books were put into the Holy Scriptures because, in typology, they give us a vivid view of God’s economy. The essence of the typology of the Old Testament history is God’s economy with Christ and His Body as the center and reality. </p>
<p data-content-id="OxV8YhhbR4nvjl0_8b18rl1x0theb1FahG4oMxJpb2hpbuoJox5O9SRBpfBthJLZu"> In one of the books of history, 2 Samuel, we see that David, a man according to God’s heart, wanted to build a house, a temple, for God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46415" data-verses="2Samuel 7:2-3">7:2-3</span>). However, God did not need that kind of house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46416" data-verses="2Samuel 7:4-7">vv. 4-7</span>). Rather, God wanted to build David a house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46417" data-verses="2Samuel 7:11">v. 11b</span>). Through a prophecy in typology, God told David that eventually the house that He would build for him would have a seed and that this seed would be God’s Son. The seed would therefore be both human and divine. It would be a human seed, yet it would also be God’s Son. Christ was God becoming the seed of David. This means that God Himself, the divine One, became a human seed, the seed of a man, David. This seed was Jesus, the God-man, Jehovah the Savior. </p>

The kingdoms of Israel and Judah became totally corrupted, forcing God to terminate them. First, God sent the Assyrians to take over the northern kingdom of Israel. On the one hand, many of the people were taken as captives to Assyria. On the other hand, the Assyrians brought in heathens, who settled in the vacant land. This produced a mixture and a confusion. The southern kingdom of Judah should have been warned by what had happened to Israel, but the people continued in their evil way more than ever. This forced God to take action through the Babylonians. The temple was burned; the walls of Jerusalem, the holy city, were torn down; the holy land was devastated; and the holy people were taken captive. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="IaztqgIa9ySECwbN7-cp4V0KFQsYGwpdiOtMoouS9kW7MnuA3RdHxl6hUtdup0yLU">THERE BEING FORTY-ONE KINGS<br/>IN THE HISTORY OF ISRAEL</h2><p data-content-id="HkO6WD_kv6jd3LjyrcYWaGDgXGUFYfISgKYAdCqCLTVso7zgaD9cL1w_Xwy4_livZ"> There were altogether forty-one kings in the history of Israel. The first three, Saul, David, and Solomon, reigned over the entire people of Israel. Nineteen kings, from Rehoboam to Zedekiah, reigned over Judah in the south, and nineteen, from Jeroboam to Hoshea, reigned over Israel in the north. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XDw75jjQQzBsyAfLT8bSvncTb-7t8vGisekbZ5UyDRSfoOa5QqU7QA7OBcABk9Ilq">NINE KINGS BEING COMPARATIVELY GOOD<br/>IN THE EYES OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="k22sE9dpxOaErQY7E9aogEgHIwshfc0J0wYgW7zgsyvGtElXVW12MkgQCafQY_7sC"> Among these forty-one kings, nine, including David, were comparatively good in the eyes of God. Thirty, including Saul, were evil in the sight of God. Two, Solomon and Jehu, were partly good and partly evil. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="J2wR24KXWbSXodmVS0UuqfzbP81Q6_gKiCTYmDXEw13N3INVtLO29xsHi4Axmy-z3">Saul</h2><p data-content-id="m6O_7wkj2I9BaSe3e98ENx3tgVmZTQyszCDa8TTo8uoGTyDgRv564K1agPzgpLRlv"> In Saul’s behavior, his performed humility in pretense, his self-interest seeking, and his ambition for the kingship not only for himself but also for his descendants were all exposed and showed that he was not building the kingdom of God but a monarchy for himself and his descendants. This seduced him to forget about God and to contact a medium, a witch, concerning his fate. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ZeQl-Ggfa-L95aZ6sV8YghXeweSMoxThsDYA0I8nk2mlgA0M5dv0L2jLLjS5nOu8b">David and Solomon</h2><p data-content-id="AsrsnVDewhN_xkUk_WTlU5wiVSHlN_BSE1HvfD3ao4LAH-PwrvA1skXIGl89AeR4K"> David behaved himself as a man according to God’s heart for God’s delight, yet he committed an awful sin in indulging <span class="pg" data-page-id="156" id="156">[156]</span> himself in sexual lust, offending God to the uttermost, so that in His Holy Word this evil is mentioned a few times (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46464" data-verses="1Kings 15:5">1 Kings 15:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46465" data-verses="Matthew 1:6">Matt. 1:6</span>). He made himself a very negative example in indulging in lust and in marrying a Gentile wife. This first influenced Solomon in his indulging of lust and in the taking of heathen women as his wives, which seduced him into idolatry, causing the loss of a great part of David’s God-given kingdom, and continually influenced most of the kings in the indulgence of lust and in idolatry. </p>
<p data-content-id="FcpF1-uvIVoxNzmD74ZJcPGQURXNFQeSQfzIHVZS-q0qbmFblc2GMguTSR9KWNqKz"> Solomon, on the one hand, was very good in expressing the wisdom of God and in building the temple for God, but, on the other hand, he was evil in the indulgence of lust, taking seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, most of whom were heathen, and in idolatry in building high places with temples of idol worship for many heathen idols. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="CopVEflapt7_izv_cR_NmTtN8zGT98EwjVeMidRMO4EuVQCM3-C7K6--k2Z2UmUGk">The Remaining Thirty-eight Kings</h2><p data-content-id="P3imRn1sndybd3IvEJwSbNLp0ystpt_zJ6c1iMpbJU2eooXgH4h3_VE3BeZdhft9I"> Of the remaining thirty-eight kings, only eight were comparatively good. Actually, however, they still were self-seeking and self-glorying, somewhat considering the kingdom of God among them something of their monarchies, not knowing God according to the way ordained by God, not denying themselves, their natural man, to live a life and carry out a career absolutely by the Spirit of God. Twenty-nine kings, among whom Jeroboam, Ahab, and Manasseh were the worst, were totally evil in such matters as rebelling, murdering, usurping the throne, and shedding the blood of the innocent for the building of their monarchies without any care for the kingdom of God on the earth. One king, Jehu, was evil as well as good. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-HfDqs344SdNa1_IMh3CEMROiSHDNCDxs31fP04YMskRzd9j1vGslXKThIbS0syRz">A FULL PICTURE OF HOW THE ELECT OF GOD<br/>COULD PARTAKE OF THE GOOD LAND<br/>AND ENJOY ALL ITS RIGHTS</h2><p data-content-id="pdolUJ2HmRpxVWtqu1cBF0xAtjCo3ioJ51yh1cWCj3yE8UJfvg9OJy_NuQ8xbwzvj"> The way in which these forty-one kings had their being, how they behaved, lived, moved, and acted in their daily living, activities, and careers, paints a full picture of how the elect of God could partake of the God-promised and God-given good land and enjoy all its rights that they could become <span class="pg" data-page-id="157" id="157">[157]</span> God’s kingdom on the earth usurped by His enemy Satan. This typifies and signifies how we can partake of the all- inclusive Christ as the portion ordained by God for us and enjoy all the rights in Christ assigned to us by God that we, the people chosen and redeemed by God, can become God’s kingdom in Christ and with Christ on the earth usurped by the evil one, God’s enemy Satan. </p>

These two evils drowned them in the death waters of idolatry, of the indulgence of lusts, and of injustice in shedding the blood of the innocent. Their evils offended their God to such an extent that He would not turn His anger from them but cast them off, first into the hands of the Assyrians and then into the hands of the Babylonians, who destroyed and burned the holy temple and the holy city, carried away into captivity the holy people to a pagan land of idol worship, and desolated the holy land for seventy years. Thus, they, as God’s elect, lost the enjoyment of the God-given good land and, instead of remaining the citizens of God’s kingdom in the holy land, they became captives in a heathen land. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2Jdp93YRIpIT_rZQnTOu8IbmburTAa9lVG8vk377fXHQnCx4qlVABu93jpk8n1BW7">A SERIOUS WARNING</h2><p data-content-id="uv29pzVJxWu1wfZ-J7ipJnYOfq-touh74uRMuv3ll3pkz3FVNsZ3nC6CMylKBM0qW"> The tragic result of such a pitiful history of the kings among God’s chosen and blessed elect should be a serious warning to us, God’s elect in the New Testament age, and should indicate to us how sober we should be to take heed to the particular points of each case. Just to be one who is according to God’s heart, like David, and just to be partly right and good in the eyes of God, like some honest Christians, do not qualify us to partake of Christ in full and to enjoy all the rights in Him that we may become adequately the church as the Body of Christ and as the kingdom of God <span class="pg" data-page-id="158" id="158">[158]</span> and of Christ. Conformity to Christ’s death by the power of His resurrection is required of us, the New Testament overcomers, that we may die to ourselves, our natural man, and live to God in resurrection. A life of living Christ, magnifying Christ, and moving and acting with Christ by the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, doing everything in and according to the Spirit, is indispensable for us, God’s New Testament seekers, to be winners in the racecourse of the divine life that we may fully enjoy Christ as the God-given good land in the church age and be gloriously rewarded to partake of Christ, in the fullest sense, in the kingdom age. </p>

For this purpose they had to be a Nazarite to take God as their Head, their authority, and submit themselves to Him as His servants, and abandon all the pleasures (wines) of the world. But all the kings failed God in this, including David, the best one among them. Thus, they did not fulfill God’s purpose for His economy. Rather, they lost their reign in God’s kingdom, which is the top portion of the enjoyment of the good land (the all-inclusive Christ). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="HkO6WD_kv6jd3LjyrcYWaGDgXGUFYfISgKYAZRKCLTVso7zgaD9cL1w_Xwy4_livZ">THE DEPUTY AUTHORITY OF GOD ON EARTH</h2><p data-content-id="XDw75jjQQzBsyAfLT8bSvncTb-7t8vGisekbcqkyDRSfoOa5QqU7QA7OBcABk9Ilq"> To be a king among God’s people is to be the deputy authority of God on the earth. The deputy authority of God on the earth is composed of God’s oracle, the speaking of God, and God’s authority, the ruling of God. Both items were entrusted to the priesthood, as in Moses, who was represented by Aaron the high priest. When the Aaronic priesthood started to wane, God raised up Samuel to speak for Him as a prophet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46468" data-verses="1Samuel 3:19-21">1 Sam. 3:19-21</span>), and Samuel brought in the kingship for God’s authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46469" data-verses="1Samuel 16:1-3">16:1-3</span>). The kingship among all the kings <span class="pg" data-page-id="159" id="159">[159]</span> of Israel was always regulated by the prophets, such as David by Nathan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46470" data-verses="2Samuel 12:1">2 Sam. 12</span>), Ahab by Elijah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46471" data-verses="1Kings 18:1">1 Kings 18</span>), and Jehoram by Elisha (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46472" data-verses="2Kings 3:1">2 Kings 3</span>), and was strengthened by the prophets, such as Hezekiah by Isaiah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46473" data-verses="2Kings 18:1">2 Kings 18—20</span>) and other kings by Jeremiah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46474" data-verses="Jeremiah 1:1-3">Jer. 1:1-3</span>). After the captivity of Israel due to the kings’ failures, it was through the prophet Daniel’s prayer that the captivity was returned (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46475" data-verses="Daniel 6:10">Dan. 6:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46476" data-verses="Daniel 9:15-25">9:15-25</span>). </p>
