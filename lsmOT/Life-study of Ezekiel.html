<p data-content-id="aO4fP_PJksfCXqSijn9t1i-BKrTAdwfYZbIFme-3od23Mf0x5MkBQvzpVrexMT24W"> Our intention in these messages is to see the visions in the book of Ezekiel. Our goal is not to research this book or to expound it but to see the visions of God’s glorious life contained in it. Therefore, instead of considering Ezekiel verse by verse or even chapter by chapter, we will endeavor to release the crucial points concerning life in this book. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bdSLpeqsU89fPsdy5AnMtTqy84FM9m_hi3bf9lycl88fNhg1oeUrZ3wbkkhWUYCI7">THE BOOK OF EZEKIEL BEING PARALLEL<br/>TO THE BOOK OF REVELATION</h2><p data-content-id="qwE1WvkY1-QdIiK-pNapP0Hzqxg-ugMEQCCUavkTc47dhd_OFD4OTSFvqKJ970JrB"> The Bible reveals that a mysterious story is unfolding in the universe—a story involving God and man. In this story God enters into man to be man’s life, causing man to have His nature and His glorious image. Ultimately, in the divine nature God and man will be built together to be the place of God’s rest. As a result of this building, God and man will have a complete union. This is the mysterious life story between God and man. </p>
<p data-content-id="yOtH1HV3kPzgY3hZDsHMOKQerPGklV8y--_Y9J7-0p3T-YCB3UCimInlfqgVbKpbr"> Although the entire Bible tells this mysterious story of God and man, two books are concerned with this story in a particular way. These books are Ezekiel and Revelation. Both books speak of God being life to man, of the Spirit of life, of the flow of the water of life, and of God’s people, who have His glorious likeness, becoming His dwelling place. Both books end with a vision of Jerusalem, and both books show us that God’s people are built together to become not only God’s dwelling place for His rest but also His corporate counterpart for His satisfaction. <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="l9G_FRwnnsPJj3AhWzxE_EJyAeriGMotQr6dTzF_0AH1ohdNbcgm_L7axAmUn1xY6"> The books of Ezekiel and Revelation go together in parallel. If we would understand Ezekiel, we need Revelation, and if we would see something in the book of Revelation, we need to understand the things revealed in Ezekiel. Thus, it is helpful to take these books together. If we read Ezekiel and Revelation together, we will see that in many respects they are quite similar. The main points in these two books are nearly the same. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Og7UyqSl0aJ0cDVx9zF6BFAU2Dkmqh4EuqGPEZPgJGx22PnoJnULS4DqVm50PXQyB">Visions Related to Life</h2><p data-content-id="4DeMWmLxu4b-lDGo37i221rTgaVzWN4EnLwWFLSDvmDsqxMC4sc0dt6rBw6Gtfsyn"> The first similarity is that both books start with visions. Both Ezekiel and John saw visions, and the visions seen by them are mainly related to life. The Bible speaks to us about life. In the books of Ezekiel and Revelation, we have not only the term <em>life</em> but also visions portraying what life is and how life works within us and among us. In both books we have not just a description of life but also visions showing us the matter of life. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ofbGyEjAxjN2AROrgUyqsO7UDQ--wpexrdoqYKmUhns76yxJ-WKrBWbHDNs8KMasj">The Flow of Living Water</h2><p data-content-id="3ADnnUCyZIFQmColjSiiMY1qvVoqq531s45-fiZptKzEeli67cXRD129xg1t3yvLL"> In the entire Bible the books that speak most clearly concerning God flowing out as life are Ezekiel and Revelation. Ezekiel and Revelation both show us the flow of the living water. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57505" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:1">Ezekiel 47:1</span> speaks of the river that flows out of the habitation of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57506" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:9">Verse 9</span> says, “Every thing shall live whither the river cometh,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57507" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:12">verse 12</span> says, “By the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57508" data-verses="Revelation 22:1-2">Revelation 22:1 and 2</span> we see the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. “He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.” In both Ezekiel <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> and Revelation, therefore, we have a river flowing out of God with the life supply. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="G8YLfHFDiG7w35WoxHmRqguA14FpWf0ygLEo09AQnh7gt7KesIFcUM0gixTROzO2D">Visions of Jerusalem</h2><p data-content-id="cfNKR6_Ikj5gcAUgF2D1HtTH4iohISr-RTlqIDpKhpHf6bnYGXOfPNwozn6omLk5q"> The main thing that Ezekiel and Revelation have in common is that both books give us a vision of Jerusalem. Ezekiel ends with the vision of Jerusalem, and so does Revelation. These two books, which end with a vision of Jerusalem, tell us that God’s intention is to come into us as life that we may have His nature and image so that, in His nature with His image, we who have Him as our life may be built up together as the holy city to be God’s dwelling place for eternity. This is the central message of both Ezekiel and Revelation. Therefore, the message of the book of Ezekiel is the same as that of the book of Revelation. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Y6VPJt1oDg8WbmA7biITOyDWaeOc88cF2EKdOPvQBDrnx0Sx5TXxBKCVwq3Eo1b_t">Both Ezekiel and John<br/>Standing in the Position of a Priest</h2><p data-content-id="EozqjcK3WHH7oN8cuyeAK65ZT_gbTidaE9HxDWd_xQtr_HoZoj_xVW3P53sr-ZAZx"> Not only are the books of Ezekiel and Revelation similar in content, but the authors of these books are similar in certain respects. The most important similarity is that the prophet Ezekiel and the apostle John were both priests before God. Although Ezekiel was a prophet, when he saw the visions recorded in his book, he stood in the position of a priest, having the status of a priest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57509" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:3">Ezek. 1:3</span>) and also the life of a priest. As he was by the river Chebar, he surely was carrying out his priesthood in the spirit, serving God and fellowshipping with God, so that the heavens were opened and he saw the glorious vision of God being life to man so that He and man could be built together. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57510" data-verses="Revelation 5:10">Revelation 5:10</span> the apostle John speaks of God’s redeemed people being priests to God. This indicates that John himself must have been serving as a priest. When John wrote the book of Revelation, his heart, standing, condition, and situation were that of a priest. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Dt4ZXNpkb1rmwOkLQFgJ51ARJSy69GVaCuSbypSfdx1T1kR7gOoqEPDVRFavwwa4V">A MINIATURE OF THE ENTIRE BIBLE</h2><p data-content-id="SdACyeUFvYVZos1f4owDhAAJzERTY6Yz4Byr-rS8Ov6KY4c_9XQ5zHiuRMmT8ec4o"> The book of Ezekiel occupies a very important position among the books of the Bible. If we know what the Bible reveals, we can see that Ezekiel is a miniature of the entire <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> Bible. What is revealed in Ezekiel is a condensed form of the whole revelation in the Bible. In this sense Ezekiel is a miniature of the Scriptures as a whole. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="g_0wEyFGf5iHyh2oYzPFUdB0aCiN6PMtnbwSWO8UaSIUu-Mv80Rrfn0O9tErFjOtz">God’s Eternal Purpose</h2><p data-content-id="eEfMgHWo1dWZ0DidRr1yOQ4NKhd9xexduNkkPs8a7-zsUc3SyJyc5YfURXamXrJQP"> The Bible shows us clearly that God’s eternal purpose is to dispense Himself into a group of human beings. His intention is to dispense Himself into us that we may have Him as our life, that we may have His nature, and that we may bear His glorious image. This means that God’s purpose, His intention, is that we and He would have the same life, nature, and image and that eventually, we and He, He and we, would be mingled together as one entity with two natures, the divine nature and the human nature, in order to be built together as God’s eternal dwelling place. This is God’s eternal purpose, which is clearly revealed in the Scriptures. The book of Ezekiel shows us the same picture in a condensed way, revealing that God’s intention is to work Himself into us as our life and to mingle Himself with us that we might be built together in Him as life to be His eternal habitation. This is what the Bible reveals, and this is what, in miniature, Ezekiel also reveals. </p>

We have seen the date of the visions, and now we will go on to see the place of the visions, the person who saw the visions, and the conditions for seeing the visions. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="d4dzE-7ip2KH-msJg1h1GKGHA6Ywj1cY4NugEh16_n8sHykLV7fOjxuCtjBE2lIwE">THE PLACE</h2><p data-content-id="Qd35Oici55jXFQ4TZ0gj7mZ2fu-ACboj_XWOxcttDFSmUnID-mvJb4Zav1g9e0C6A"> The second point in the introduction is the place where Ezekiel saw the visions. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57552" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:3">Verse 3</span> tells us that the visions came to Ezekiel when he was “in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar.” </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="KoVbp6lsJDUeqDS2edMNs-pPEQyLEUJGTddYMb8btjSk16Qd0kAVfs-qPqF9MAp6E">In Chaldea</h2><p data-content-id="PV2fNgIGsuE-bUFgF7Z0oPCXo-jTxnhBooHdZuUQ9Das4Je1zEiSHqrsJ0upsJB4U"> The place—the land of the Chaldeans—was not a good place, for Chaldea was the place where Babel began. The name <em>Babel</em> in Hebrew is the equivalent of <em>Babylon</em> in Greek. Thus, we may say that Chaldea was actually Babylon and that Babylon was Babel, the place where Satan collected the fallen people to rebel against God. The very place where Ezekiel saw the visions was the place where Satan instigated the greatest rebellion against God among the fallen people. That was also the place out of which God had called Abraham that He might have a chosen people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57553" data-verses="Genesis 11:6">Gen. 11:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57554" data-verses="Genesis 11:31">31</span>). Unfortunately, at Ezekiel’s time most of God’s chosen people had been carried back to that place. Their captivity was their fall. They <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> had fallen into the very place out of which their forefather Abraham had been called by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="-wKvpHCzaienBNn1FUredxcWgeWSNwMXmd0XuRQTF8l38jLFug9nKYw9UAgkaYR6g"> I would ask you to consider the situation of today’s Christians. Are most Christians in the land of Canaan or in the land of the Chaldeans? Surely the majority of Christians are not in the good land but in a place of degradation. For this reason the book of Ezekiel exactly fits the situation of Christians today. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="p38LhWt-j07U2iMCnpvTRy9j63Kmv3mR3L5H63FoAbrSm3ahMmnisRyTT9j-cFYQW">By a River</h2><p data-content-id="v8e1FNT-phHR2DucAbCpb03sY-fK-HGbsUyvlVBbqjrDFw4byAhaNfrI7B0v1zrtp"> When Ezekiel saw the visions, he was by a river. He says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57555" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">verse 1</span>, “I was among the captives by the river of Chebar.” The river of Chebar signifies the power of the enemy to damage God’s people (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57556" data-verses="Isaiah 8:7-8">Isa. 8:7-8</span>). <em>Chebar</em> means “strong,” “many,” “powerful.” This river, the river of Babylon, indicates that Babylon was strong and powerful, and thus it signifies the power of Babylon in being against God’s people. Today the “river of Chebar” is the satanic tide of the age that carries people away from God to Babylon. </p>
<p data-content-id="WfEVbagx2vme1BiQhHb5Bno_ryXwiPb1Nstsb4tLT0KnncoTQeDqZVNZPsaUBaDG-"> There are two rivers in the book of Ezekiel: the river Chebar in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57557" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">chapter one</span> and the river flowing out of the temple in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57558" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:1">chapter forty-seven</span>. The river Chebar carries the people of God away from God, but the river flowing out of the temple brings people into God’s life. We need to realize that these two rivers are still on earth today. One river is the trend, the course, the tide, of this world. This is the river of Babylon, the river in the fallen world, which carries people away from God. We praise the Lord that there is another river and that everything lives wherever this river comes. </p>
<p data-content-id="2PYXRuBRbk3pazLkKTlYvBkinRwv15ApCa1VN8KxIix8cbBt0J74ZrjjS6AX6gZ1X"> Two rivers are flowing today. One river is of this world; the other river is of the holy land. One river carries people away from God; the other river brings people back to God in life. One river destroys the building of God; the other river builds up God’s dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="uLbh7taL_7-XoK9Q8ONqOzYE_hvJobsJZa-NymaFABQVYF3nbW2_GsMshc2YHU6b6"> By which river are you—the river Chebar or the river that flows out of the dwelling place of God? You may say that you are by the river of living water which comes out of the dwelling place of God, but you still may have something of the course of this age, of the trend of today’s world. If you are still <span class="pg" data-page-id="15" id="15">[15]</span> in the trend of today’s world, you are not by the river of living water but by the river of Chebar, and you are not in the holy land but in the land of the Chaldeans. </p>
<p data-content-id="fLosXWms1KYdGPCBWfcZMViDx8OQ_A9Ht8UGClPEeBQVlDGoJcH_conm1QNn2Q_o4"> When the heavens were opened to Ezekiel, he was <em>by</em> the river of Chebar, but he was not <em>in</em> this river. Many of the people of Israel had been killed by the Babylonian army; others had died because of famine, disease, and wild animals. Nevertheless, the situation was not totally hopeless, for God still left some “dry land” by the river which had carried His people away. By giving them this “dry land,” God enabled them to stay alive and to be preserved. This indicates that God’s grace remained with Ezekiel, with King Jehoiachin, and with many others who had been carried away into captivity. If they had not been by the banks of the river Chebar but instead had been in the river, they all would have perished. Because of God’s grace they could still live by the river in the land of captivity. Although they could not live in Canaan and thus could not enjoy the abundance of grace in Christ, they could still enjoy some mercy in the land of captivity. </p>
<p data-content-id="IX_UvHDiNQNKuMzDpACM6w8R-I2jmOXo9otBId5AM2tk46g0M3mHb3T-Twt1do4v1"> The visions recorded in the book of Ezekiel are urgently needed by today’s Christians and by today’s church. The more I contact the Lord and fellowship with Him and the more I observe today’s situation, the more I realize that the visions of Ezekiel are messages from God for the present age. The visions God gave to Ezekiel were for a people who were in captivity by the river Chebar. Today most of God’s children are also in the land of captivity. Instead of remaining in Christ as the good land of Canaan, they have fallen into captivity in Babylon, where they do not live in Christ properly and continually and where they do not enjoy the riches of Christ. This is the overall condition of Christians today. For this reason, I believe that the visions in the book of Ezekiel meet the need of God’s people today. </p>

Ezekiel was this kind of person. Although he was in the land of captivity, he still lived in the presence of God and ministered before God. He was by the river Chebar, not in the holy temple, yet as a priest he looked to God, prayed to God, contacted God, fellowshipped with God, and waited for God. Because Ezekiel was such a person and contacted God in such a way, the heavens were opened to him, and he “saw visions of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57561" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">v. 1</span>). </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57562" data-verses="Ezekiel 3:8-9">3:8-9a</span> the Lord said to Ezekiel, “Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.

This verse covers four main things: the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum. First, a stormy wind came from the north. Second, a great cloud came along with the wind.

Those who know God can testify that our spiritual experiences are according to our knowledge of God. Likewise, our service and the church affairs also depend on our knowledge of God. The degree of our knowing God will determine both the degree of our spiritual experience and the situation of the church. Spiritually speaking, everything we have depends on God’s being, vision, and manifestation and on our knowing God. </p>
<p data-content-id="EozqjcK3WHH7oN8cuyeAK6ZZavAbTidaE9HxDWd_xQtr_HoZoj_xVW3P53sr-ZAZx"> The visions in the book of Ezekiel begin not with man but with God. The visions, which begin from the north, where God is, show us God in His will, plan, intention, work, action, and relationship with man. These visions reveal what God expects man to be in relation to Him. In addition to the four items mentioned above, the visions in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57601" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">chapter one</span> include the four living creatures, the high and dreadful wheels, a sky as clear as crystal, God’s glorious throne, and the man upon the <span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> throne. As we consider God’s glorious visions in this chapter, we need to pay careful attention to all these matters. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Dt4ZXNpkb1rmwOkLQFgJ51gRBCC69GVaCuSbypSfdx1T1kR7gOoqEPDVRFavwwa4V">THE BIBLE BEING A BOOK OF PICTURES<br/>THAT DESCRIBE SPIRITUAL THINGS</h2><p data-content-id="EozqjcK3WHH7oN8cuyeAK6ZZT9gbTidaE9HxDWd_xQtr_HoZoj_xVW3P53sr-ZAZx"> The Bible is a book of pictures revealing to us God and the spiritual things. God is Spirit, and as such He is abstract, mysterious, invisible, intangible, and unfathomable. Not only is God abstract, but all spiritual things are also abstract. Without the pictures in the Bible, it would be rather difficult for us to understand God and the spiritual things. In His wisdom God uses visible, material things to describe invisible, spiritual things. Furthermore, He uses signs and symbols to express abstract, mysterious matters. For this reason the Bible uses many types, figures, and pictures to describe and portray spiritual things. </p>
<p data-content-id="Dt4ZXNpkb1rmwOkLQFgJ51gRJQy69GVaCuSbypSfdx1T1kR7gOoqEPDVRFavwwa4V"> A great many items in the universe are symbols of spiritual things. For example, the sun symbolizes Christ as our light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57602" data-verses="Malachi 4:2">Mal. 4:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57603" data-verses="Luke 1:78">Luke 1:78</span>), and food symbolizes Christ as our sustenance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57604" data-verses="John 6:35">John 6:35</span>). Actually, all the positive things in the universe may be used to portray what Christ is to us. God’s intention in His creation is to use the things of creation to illustrate what Christ is. This means that the entire universe came into existence for the purpose of describing Christ. For example, if vines had not been created, the Lord Jesus could not have used a vine to describe Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57605" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15:1</span>). If there were no foxes or birds, Christ could not have compared His situation in His ministry to that of foxes with their holes and birds with their roosts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57606" data-verses="Matthew 8:20">Matt. 8:20</span>). Even the pasture was created so that the Lord Jesus could use it as an illustration of Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57607" data-verses="John 10:9">John 10:9</span>). Because the universe with the billions of things and persons in it was created for the purpose of describing Christ, He, in revealing Himself, can find in any environment something to serve as an illustration of Himself. The whole universe is a picture of Christ. If we see this, we will realize how rich, profound, unlimited, and unsearchable Christ is. </p>
<p data-content-id="SdACyeUFvYVZos1f4owDhAgJwExTY6Yz4Byr-rS8Ov6KY4c_9XQ5zHiuRMmT8ec4o"> Just as the Bible as a whole is a picture book, so Ezekiel as a miniature of the Bible is also a picture book, a book full of <span class="pg" data-page-id="25" id="25">[25]</span> pictures. These pictures are presented in the form of visions. The visions Ezekiel saw were absolutely related to God and to spiritual things and therefore should not be understood in a literal, physical way. If we try to interpret the visions in Ezekiel literally, we will not be able to understand them. </p>
<p data-content-id="g_0wEyFGf5iHyh2oYzPFUdh0ZCCN6PMtnbwSWO8UaSIUu-Mv80Rrfn0O9tErFjOtz"> When I was young, I could not understand the book of Ezekiel. The more I read this book, the more confused I became. In particular, I could not understand the matter of the four living creatures. Each of the living creatures had four faces: at the front, the face of a man; on the right, the face of a lion; on the left, the face of an ox; and at the back, the face of an eagle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57608" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:5-6">Ezek. 1:5-6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57609" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:10">10</span>). Furthermore, “the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot,” and “they had the hands of a man under their wings” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57610" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:7">vv. 7a</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57611" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:8">8a</span>). I thought that the picture of the living creatures was very strange, and I could not understand it at all. I thank the Lord that as I gradually advanced in my spiritual experience, I began to understand the visions in Ezekiel, comparing the record in Ezekiel with other portions of the Word. Eventually, like someone putting together the pieces of a puzzle in order to have a complete picture, I put various parts of the Word together and began to see the pictures of the spiritual matters portrayed in the book of Ezekiel, realizing that Ezekiel uses visible, physical things to signify spiritual things. Now in our study of Ezekiel we need to see the intrinsic spiritual significance of the pictures in this book, considering them in light of the entire Bible and comparing them with our spiritual experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="eEfMgHWo1dWZ0DidRr1yOQYNJg99xexduNkkPs8a7-zsUc3SyJyc5YfURXamXrJQP"> Let us now begin to consider the four matters in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57612" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:4">Ezekiel 1:4</span> point by point. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5B77wnH1FzY8BLTY6fCXJLQ8cGPk2y-0-wcSHFSE7ZmUp0tp06z5YVYlyz-mtu8g6">THE STORMY WIND</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="NRHnpckJ6kUzVbbOlq4UtvThVyMs0xCY8-NMDod05m56iu8RUUufdxZWFCU9NFkvw">From the North </h2>
<p data-content-id="t8I9sHpJ7S0cz__sqMkC7RG_19KYvi-xEyhSUjmX-nxUewXzrG6j2mAcXlH_K87nH"> The first part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57613" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:4">Ezekiel 1:4</span> says, “I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north.” John Nelson Darby’s New Translation and the American Standard Version both translate the Hebrew word rendered <em>whirlwind</em> as “stormy wind,” and I feel that this translation is preferable. Thus, this verse is saying that a <em>stormy wind</em> came from the north. <span class="pg" data-page-id="26" id="26">[26]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="hcD2jLAk2Q_I5adxkIUEZpf7OkIgxfodbVTqRxpuLmJmSrEo35x0gZeqOh4O0u4mK"> Why did the stormy wind come from the north and not from the south, the east, or the west? The answer to this question is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57614" data-verses="Psalms 75:6-7">Psalm 75:6-7a</span>: “For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. But God is the judge.” Here <em>north</em> is replaced with <em>God</em>. This indicates that God is at the north. In geographical terms the north is commonly regarded as up, and thus to go north is to go up. God, who is at the north, is always up. Spiritually speaking, this means that when we are going north, we are going to God. The fact that the stormy wind came from the north means that it came from God. The dwelling place, the habitation, of God is the source of all spiritual things. The stormy wind came from the north, from the habitation of God. God, therefore, was the source of the stormy wind. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="UANm6l8X60Ln81YDphtJer6CIXVvd6_GJKp7S1vl6365tIU4hsCnLJVxdEpfXhTLP">Signifying the Spirit of God</h2><p data-content-id="MrGAKmEwuRJZufnXIFYv27nmY9bi7bqmm0lYolW9Gtafj5V6y_b9osiAx0Pa2oeqC"> The Hebrew word for <em>wind</em> is <em>ruach. Ruach</em> may be translated “wind” or “breath” or “spirit.” In the King James Version of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57615" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:1">Ezekiel 37</span>, this Hebrew word is translated in all three of these ways: “wind” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57616" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:9">verse 9</span>, “breath” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57617" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:5">verses 5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57618" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:6">6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57619" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:8">8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57620" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:9">9</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57621" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:10">10</span>, and “Spirit” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57622" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:1">verses 1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57623" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:14">14</span>. It is difficult for translators to decide whether in a certain verse <em>ruach</em> means wind, breath, or spirit. The decision must be made according to the context. </p>
<p data-content-id="VCxrIZDROhzMg_iDUgurevwm3lZwtZDDUMpTzPLj8wbLbl_0fQ-LNoTLnOG_szDEn"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57624" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:4">1:4</span> <em>ruach</em> denotes a wind, a stormy wind which signifies nothing less than the powerful Spirit. On the day of Pentecost there was a rushing, mighty wind which filled the house where the one hundred twenty were sitting. Then all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57625" data-verses="Acts 2:2">Acts 2:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57626" data-verses="Acts 2:4">4a</span>). No doubt, that rushing, mighty wind was the powerful Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="iqHzuS4OBJEFR4n8TR2JjyC_RR-yBxosrRqyPHAnj_rhfYAb5wc9op72svQD0kj0j"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57627" data-verses="John 3:8">John 3:8</span> the Lord Jesus said, “The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.” Some versions point out in a footnote that the word <em>wind</em> in this verse is a translation of the Greek word for spirit, <em>pneuma.</em> The Hebrew word <em>ruach</em> and the Greek word <em>pneuma</em> have exactly the same meaning. Like <em>ruach,</em> the word <em>pneuma</em> can be translated “wind,” “breath,” or “spirit.” Thus, in this verse the Greek words translated <em>the wind blows</em> may <span class="pg" data-page-id="27" id="27">[27]</span> also be rendered “the Spirit blows.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57628" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:4">Ezekiel 1:4</span> the strong, stormy wind is a figure, a picture, of the mighty Spirit of God. </p>

My burden is to point out that the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum should be a Christian’s spiritual life story. Throughout our whole Christian life, our spiritual experiences should be a continual cycle involving these four matters. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hcD2jLAk2Q_I5adxkIUEZov7J0ogxfodbVTqRxpuLmJmSrEo35x0gZeqOh4O0u4mK">NOT A THEORY BUT AN EXPERIENCE<br/>OF THE BLOWING WIND, THE COVERING CLOUD,<br/>THE CONSUMING FIRE, AND THE GLOWING ELECTRUM</h2><p data-content-id="UANm6l8X60Ln81YDphtJeqKCOHlvd6_GJKp7S1vl6365tIU4hsCnLJVxdEpfXhTLP"> What we spoke in the previous message regarding the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum is absolutely not a theory but something of spiritual experience. If a person has never experienced the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum, that person surely is not a normal Christian. A certain person may have a little doctrinal knowledge of the truth concerning salvation and then be baptized in a formal way without having any experience of the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum. A genuinely saved person is one who has had spiritual transactions with God, one who has experienced the blowing of the wind and the covering of the cloud. </p>
<p data-content-id="MrGAKmEwuRJZufnXIFYv26XmSv7i7bqmm0lYolW9Gtafj5V6y_b9osiAx0Pa2oeqC"> Before you were saved, your life might have seemed peaceful and tranquil, but one day you heard the gospel and experienced the blowing of a mighty wind. As a result, you were awakened and began to wonder about the meaning of <span class="pg" data-page-id="38" id="38">[38]</span> human life and, in particular, about the significance of your life. You began to question yourself, saying, “Where did I come from, and where am I going? What is the purpose of my life? What is its meaning? If I continue to live the way I have been living, where will I end up?” The wind kept blowing upon you and within you until you believed into the Lord and received His full salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="VCxrIZDROhzMg_iDUgureuAm83pwtZDDUMpTzPLj8wbLbl_0fQ-LNoTLnOG_szDEn"> A spiritual wind not only blew upon us when we were saved but also blows every time we have a spiritual revival. A particular believer may be quite careless regarding his spiritual life and yet be quite content with his spiritual condition. If such a believer is in a good mood, he may read the Bible and pray, but if he is in a bad mood, he may neglect prayer and Bible reading. The situation is very different with a believer who experiences the blowing of a mighty spiritual wind. When the wind blows upon him, he cannot feel satisfied with his spiritual condition. On the contrary, he will become restless and quite concerned about his situation and begin to ask questions concerning the condition of his spiritual life. The principle with the church corporately is the same as it is with a believer personally. The blowing of the wind always makes us feel restless and concerned about our situation and condition. I deeply long that a rushing, mighty wind would blow upon all the saints in all the churches and make them restless and cause them to seek the Lord about their spiritual condition. </p>
<p data-content-id="IX_UvHDiNQNKuMzDpACM6xcR-K2jmOXo9otBId5AM2tk46g0M3mHb3T-Twt1do4v1"> The blowing wind brings the covering cloud. We have learned from our spiritual experience that when the Holy Spirit blows upon us and touches us, we sense that God is overshadowing us and exercising His care for us. His presence is like a cloud covering us and surrounding us, and we can sense both His presence and His care. Following this we experience the burning of the consuming fire. This burning makes us realize that we are wrong in many ways and with many persons. Such a burning exposes our condition and causes us to confess our transgressions and deal with ourselves before God. The more the fire burns, the more we confess and the more we are sanctified and purified. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ha_9caqJ-gtW20LDfXmwcVwsUp3on1Pc0q0siMVKOik-gRx59IRw2r9MVWNDzyftI"> I would ask you to consider the matters of the blowing <span class="pg" data-page-id="39" id="39">[39]</span> wind, the covering cloud, and the burning fire in light of your own spiritual experience. Have you not experienced the wind blowing upon you, the cloud covering you, and the fire burning and purifying you? Before you experienced the Spirit’s blowing and burning, you might have felt that others were always at fault and that you were always right. But then through the blowing of the wind, under the covering of the cloud, and by the burning of the fire, you began to see how sinful and corrupt you were. The fire burned you to such an extent that you realized that even your love was selfish and fleshly. </p>
<p data-content-id="XepL-yKvCOMfBVF1zePEn3_xKNnDxci6eLedCPyLziLypB00oXRDxbo8XzhFKTQ4h"> This fire consumes not only our pride but also our humility, not only our wickedness but also our kindness, not only our hatred but also our love. When we are under the blowing of the wind, the covering of the cloud, and the burning of the fire, we will not feel that we are all right. On the contrary, our “I” will fall apart and be dissolved. Eventually, this fire will burn away everything other than God. Only God can pass through this burning. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="k4Ajjh-9TG5V-Yz5rWAXy43puUQD6qGu0sspdVg7meIXyXNW5MC3fw76TFIIoEuvx">THE RADIANT EXPRESSION OF THE REDEEMING GOD</h2><p data-content-id="JYnuRkNofqaCL_SuH1kdcTtsIw_6Xfa3kN3GnclC0uwXkYmOk2tHLkh0JpDrtZKzP"> We thank the Lord that in the fire there is the glowing electrum. I would remind you that the electrum, an alloy of gold and silver, signifies the redeeming God. After we have been burned by God as the consuming fire, we sense that we are filled with God’s nature and glory. This means that once we have experienced the wind, the cloud, and the fire, the only thing that remains is the glowing electrum, the redeeming God. The wind and the cloud bring forth the fire, and the fire manifests the shining electrum. The issue of the spiritual transactions involving the blowing wind, the covering cloud, and the purifying fire is always the radiant expression of the redeeming God. </p>
<p data-content-id="zqHbu0U7uWGsnviHhDYAWeAirKd65EDd4MObME8uyyFF5Of7TpcGEbbReHiBZe4IV"> At this juncture I would like to give a brief testimony of my experience when I was in my twenties.

As I consider my experience in light of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57674" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:4">Ezekiel 1:4</span>, I can testify that I surely experienced the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum. Shortly after I <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> reached the top of the mountain, I sensed the moving of the Holy Spirit, the blowing of the wind. Often as I was singing, my tears flowed freely. At those times I sensed also that I was under the overshadowing of the great cloud of the Lord’s presence. At the same time, I had a strong realization that I was sinful and corrupt, and I confessed my sins to the Lord. After praying in this way and after reading the Bible, I was filled with something sweet and glorious—the redeeming God as the glowing electrum. This experience was repeated morning after morning for quite a period of time. </p>

When we were saved, we experienced the Lord in these four ways, and we should continue to experience Him in this way. In fact, every time we are graced by the Lord, we have spiritual transactions with Him involving the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum. When you wake up in the morning, you may sense that the wind of the Spirit is blowing upon you and that a cloud is overshadowing you. Then as you spend some time to pray, you may sense that a fire is burning within you to consume your corruption, worldliness, and many other negative things. Eventually, you may sense that within you there is something bright, beautiful, and dignified—the glowing electrum. As a result of this experience, you may live the whole day in the enjoyment of the glowing electrum. However, as you live and walk in this corrupted world, you cannot avoid being defiled and contaminated, so at the end of the day or the next morning you may have a further experience of the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum. Once again the wind blows, the cloud broods, and the fire burns. You confess your sins and deal with your filthiness, and following this you once again enjoy the shining of the electrum within you. </p>

<p data-content-id="nspAW8ybtAwd-FktD5YN6ABw8NdVLabqi3PMGvjyYxVnV4VwKoIMl0lUt0qaHwvp9"> Ezekiel is a book of figures, or pictures, portraying spiritual things. We have considered four of these figures—the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum—which depict what God is to us. In our experience of Him, God is like a blowing wind, like a brooding, hovering, and overshadowing cloud, like a flashing, enlightening, searching, and consuming fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57691" data-verses="Hebrews 12:29">Heb. 12:29</span>), which sanctifies us by burning us, and like the glowing, shining electrum. The electrum, composed of the elements of gold and silver, signifies the compound God, the Lamb-God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57692" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Rev. 22:1</span>). The God who lives within us today is the Lamb-God; He is the very God (gold) and He is also the Redeemer (silver). Hence, as the compound God, He is signified by the electrum. For the Jews, God is typified merely by gold, but for us Christians, our God, the compound God, is signified by the electrum with its two elements of gold and silver. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6qZ5AXEp8asjHStkAiRCeS5uUazlXOIcRxYU_wF5J7VdKbK50VwX457J7bPXvUbLm">NOT DEAD BUT LIVING</h2><p data-content-id="Rrf22uMBNQan9P4T7jHi3bHH4YTQyypij84f2YwjWmMEgM7jEdvf-sug8okDcYg7H"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57693" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:5">Ezekiel 1:5a</span> says, “Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures.” We need to pay attention to the first word in this verse, <em>also.</em> Not only does electrum come out of the fire; something else also comes out. The wind brings in the cloud; the cloud enfolds the fire; and the fire produces the electrum plus something else—the four living creatures. When we experience God as the blowing wind, the overshadowing cloud, the burning fire, and the electrum, we become the four living creatures. We were dead, but by <span class="pg" data-page-id="44" id="44">[44]</span> experiencing God in this way we become something living. The Lord Jesus said that “the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God” and that “those who hear will live” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57694" data-verses="John 5:25">John 5:25</span>). Paul said that we were dead but God has made us alive (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57695" data-verses="Ephesians 2:5">Eph. 2:5</span>). The more we have the cycle of the wind, cloud, fire, and electrum, the more living we become. Every time we are blown upon by God and overshadowed and consumed and burned by Him, we are enlivened. As a result we become lively and vibrant. If we are not living in the meetings, this proves that we are lacking in the experience of the cycle consisting of the wind, cloud, fire, and electrum. The more we experience this cycle, the more living we will be. Whereas many of today’s Christians prefer to attend a quiet service, we should be very living in the meetings and sometimes even make a joyful noise to the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57696" data-verses="Psalms 95:1-2">Psa. 95:1-2</span>). Only the living ones can make such a noise. If we experience God as the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum, we will not be quiet but will be living and even noisy in the church meetings. </p>
<p data-content-id="sTV0uWaZaR7-etDNprDCLycPMSFH8qHOUJZKsAEyg7zQL_4KVEdzSLh5sv9V5JA-d"> The word <em>living</em> in Hebrew has the same root as the word for <em>life</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57697" data-verses="Genesis 2:9">Genesis 2:9</span>, which speaks of the tree of life. How can we, who are creatures, become the living creatures? We become living creatures by experiencing God as the tree of life. This life, the divine, eternal, uncreated life of God, is the real life. Only by having this real life can we become a living creature. Whenever we experience God as the tree of life, we sense that we have something living within us. We have a living element, a living factor, within us. This living element, or factor, will always make us living. </p>
<p data-content-id="wg-jmis-AhzGwVom8C3CVloDbWHliGiqarrGBZKYNwYK61MYfi1wuCb7PAN8DXDzF"> Before we were saved, we were dead in our offenses and sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57698" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Eph. 2:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57699" data-verses="Ephesians 2:5">5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57700" data-verses="Colossians 2:13">Col. 2:13</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57701" data-verses="John 5:25">John 5:25</span> the Lord Jesus spoke directly concerning those who were spiritually dead: “Truly, truly, I say to you, An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.” In this verse to live means to be alive in spirit. When we were saved and regenerated, we experienced the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum. The wind of the Holy Spirit blew upon us, the cloud of the Holy Spirit overshadowed us, and the fire of the Holy Spirit enlightened us and burned us. As a result, we confessed our sins, and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="45" id="45">[45]</span> electrum was produced inside of us. In this way we heard the voice of the Son of God and were enlivened. We met the glory of God and were saved and regenerated in His glorious manifestation. Through the experience of the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum, we, who were dead, were enlivened to become living creatures. Now we should daily experience the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum so that we may become living and vibrant in our inner being. </p>
<p data-content-id="hcD2jLAk2Q_I5adxkIUEZo_7OmIgxfodbVTqRxpuLmJmSrEo35x0gZeqOh4O0u4mK"> How can we prove that we are no longer dead but have become living creatures? There is a twofold proof, that is, an inward proof and an outward proof. The inward proof that we are living creatures is that we now have a feeling, or sense, of life. Living persons have feelings. For example, as we are sitting in a room, we will have a feeling concerning the temperature. We may feel hot or we may feel cold. A dead person, on the contrary, has no such feeling. Likewise, if we are living before God, we will have an inward, spiritual sense regarding our situation. If we offend God or if we do something that is not pleasing to God, we will have a feeling about this. A person who is spiritually living will have a deep feeling whenever he lives in a way that does not glorify God or that is not pleasing to Him. If our inner feeling, the inner sense of life, is sensitive, deep, and fresh, this is a proof that inwardly we are living and that we are therefore a living creature. However, some children of God may behave very badly, putting the name of the Lord to shame, yet they have no feeling about what they are doing. They are far from God and they need to repent, but they have no inner feeling at all. This is a proof that inwardly they are dead. A believer who is truly a living creature has much inner feeling about his situation. </p>
<p data-content-id="UANm6l8X60Ln81YDphtJeqaCIVVvd6_GJKp7S1vl6365tIU4hsCnLJVxdEpfXhTLP"> Whereas the first proof that we are living creatures is inward and is related to our feeling, the second proof is outward and is related to our activities. A dead person is inactive, but a living person is very active. For example, children are very active because they are full of life. The principle is the same in the Christian life. A Christian who is living, that is, who is a living creature, will engage in a number of activities. The first of these activities is prayer. Just as we cannot live physically without breathing, so we cannot live <span class="pg" data-page-id="46" id="46">[46]</span> spiritually without praying. Prayer is a Christian’s spiritual breathing, and it is often spontaneous. For instance, as soon as we wake up in the morning, we may spontaneously thank the Lord for a new day. To pray like this is to breathe, and it is a sign that we are living. However, some believers may go for a long time, even months, without praying. Their lack of the activity of prayer is a proof that they are not living. Other activities that prove that we are living creatures include reading the Bible, functioning in the meetings, serving God, and preaching the gospel. Not reading the Bible, not attending the meetings and not functioning in the meetings, not serving God, not testifying for the Lord, and not preaching the gospel—all these shortages indicate that one is not a living creature. The way to prove that you are a living Christian is to consider all these points. Do you pray? Do you read the Bible? Do you exercise your spirit to function in the meetings? Do you serve the Lord? Do you testify for the Lord and preach the gospel? If you are lacking in these matters, you are not a living believer. </p>

<p data-content-id="C92KRmALSxN5rAScVq8h1bR01jeAIB1PguamKjHkO2548nR0HClW6SzIeuBtdPCFg"> The first chapter of Ezekiel contains many figures which compose one picture. Unless all these figures are applied in a spiritual way, they seem to be meaningless. Consider, for example, the four faces of the living creatures: the face of a man, the face of a lion, the face of an ox, and the face of an eagle. If we apply these things spiritually, they are quite significant. </p>
<p data-content-id="PV2fNgIGsuE-bUFgF7Z0oOCXvsDTxnhBooHdZuUQ9Das4Je1zEiSHqrsJ0upsJB4U"> In this message we will consider the eagle’s wings, the human hands, and the calf’s hoofs.

<p data-content-id="-wKvpHCzaienBNn1FUredwcWmMmSNwMXmd0XuRQTF8l38jLFug9nKYw9UAgkaYR6g"> Speaking of the living creatures, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57747" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:6">Ezekiel 1:6</span> says, “Every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.” Surely the wings are the wings of an eagle because among the creatures represented by the four faces, only the eagle has the wings. </p>

Man’s feet are not straight but are shaped like an <em>L</em>. A lion does not have feet, but instead has paws with claws. An eagle also has claws. Strictly speaking, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57750" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:7">verse 7</span> speaks not of ox’s feet but of calf’s feet, or, hoofs, which are straight. <span class="pg" data-page-id="58" id="58">[58]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="qwE1WvkY1-QdIiK-pNapP13zjjA-ugMEQCCUavkTc47dhd_OFD4OTSFvqKJ970JrB"> If we would understand the spiritual significance of the eagle’s wings, the man’s hands, and the calf’s hoofs, we need to remember the significance of the blowing of the wind, the hovering and brooding of the cloud, and the consuming, searching, enlightening, and burning of the fire, out of which comes the glowing electrum. As we have pointed out, the experience of all these things causes us to become the living creatures, expressing Christ and living out His life in a corporate way. </p>

In the Bible the wings of an eagle signify the strength of God applied to us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57751" data-verses="Exodus 19:4">Exodus 19:4</span>, God said to His people, “Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself.” This verse speaks of the strength of God applied to His people. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57752" data-verses="Isaiah 40:31">Isaiah 40:31</span> says, “They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.” This also shows us that God’s strength applied to us is like the wings of an eagle. </p>
<p data-content-id="_mRKRptREFnggL-PU4CvKTGjQ1XwVg0KRxmxiSAqvoNRoVSn3LxL5lR9p8SgEoUoB"> In the New Testament the eagle’s wings are the grace, the power, and the strength of God in Christ applied to us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57753" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:7">Second Corinthians 4:7</span> says, “We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.” This is the eagle’s wings. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57754" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:12">1:12</span> Paul says, “Our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.” Again, this is the eagle’s wings. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57755" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:9">12:9a</span> the Lord Jesus said to Paul, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.” Because of this, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57756" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:9">12:9b</span> Paul could say, “Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of <span class="pg" data-page-id="59" id="59">[59]</span> Christ might tabernacle over me.” In our experience of the Lord, the power of Christ may overshadow us, even as the eagle’s wings overshadow the covered ones. From these verses we can see that the eagle’s wings signify the strength and the grace of the Lord Jesus applied to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="BIuz1ZsNpSVEtpe_c5-r1od6uoK9YkuX1Qe6UHpVubV30a2gTCokxsb0a78hLe8d5"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57757" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:10">1 Corinthians 15:10</span> Paul says, “By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.” This is the eagle’s wings. Whatever we do and whatever we are should not be according to our own wisdom, strength, and ability but by the grace, power, and strength of the Lord. Therefore, as Paul says, if we boast, we should boast in the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57758" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:31">1:31</span>). We have no boast in ourselves or in anything else but only in the Lord. His power, strength, and grace are the eagle’s wings to us today. </p>
<p data-content-id="xpNFS3cnmgvzIaDTu2KkVEIEijrkbcA-vKEI4I9BgDZLERtmA4_nBIxGCUirLQktl"> In our Christian life we all should bear four wings on four sides, showing others that whatever we are and whatever we do is not by ourselves and is not of ourselves but of God, so that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us. </p>

This joining is for moving. Later we will see that this moving is altogether a corporate matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qd35Oici55jXFQ4TZ0gj7nZ2V8eACboj_XWOxcttDFSmUnID-mvJb4Zav1g9e0C6A"> The Bible reveals that the wings of an eagle are not only for power but also for protection.

Whatever we do and <span class="pg" data-page-id="60" id="60">[60]</span> whatever we are must be by the grace of the Lord and the power of the Lord. At the same time, we are under the overshadowing, the covering, of the Lord’s grace and power. </p>
<p data-content-id="l9G_FRwnnsPJj3AhWzxE_F5yDeLiGMotQr6dTzF_0AH1ohdNbcgm_L7axAmUn1xY6"> This indicates that as Christians, God’s children, we should have an element that causes others to wonder at us. They should sense that something is covering and overshadowing us. They should realize that we are normal, yet there is something empowering, strengthening, overshadowing, and covering us. </p>
<p data-content-id="Og7UyqSl0aJ0cDVx9zF6BEwU1DEmqh4EuqGPEZPgJGx22PnoJnULS4DqVm50PXQyB"> The front face of the four living creatures is the face of a man, but the body is that of an eagle. Two of his wings are stretched forth to join to the other living creatures, and two of his wings are wrapped around his body for a cover. Thus, if you look at his face, he looks like a man, but if you look at his body, he looks like an eagle. He looks like a man, but he moves like an eagle. This indicates that we must always express ourselves like a normal man, for example, like a normal and proper husband, wife, parent, or child. But when others look at us and consider us, they should realize that there is something covering, empowering, strengthening, protecting, and overshadowing us. As a result, it should be difficult for others to describe us. Those who work with such a person might say, “He can suffer the things we cannot suffer, and he can bear a responsibility that we cannot bear. He understands things more deeply than we do. What kind of person is he? How can he live this way?” </p>
<p data-content-id="4DeMWmLxu4b-lDGo37i220bTjb1zWN4EnLwWFLSDvmDsqxMC4sc0dt6rBw6Gtfsyn"> The point here is that with us as children of God there should always be something mysterious. Although we suffer, we are happy and rejoice in the Lord because something is covering us. We have two wings for moving and another two wings for covering and overshadowing us. These moving and overshadowing wings should give others an impression of the Divine Being. We have the four wings of an eagle, giving others the impression that we have God with us as our power and protection. This is the eagle. </p>

<p data-content-id="XepL-yKvCOMfBVF1zePEn3PxNfnDxci6eLedCPyLziLypB00oXRDxbo8XzhFKTQ4h"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57783" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:11-14">Ezekiel 1:11b-14</span> reveals a very clear picture of coordination. No other verses in the Bible present the matter of coordination in such a definite and practical way. In this message we will begin to consider the coordination of the four living creatures described in this portion of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57784" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">Ezekiel 1</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="k4Ajjh-9TG5V-Yz5rWAXy4HpoGAD6qGu0sspdVg7meIXyXNW5MC3fw76TFIIoEuvx">COORDINATION IN THE DIVINE POWER,<br/>STRENGTH, AND SUPPLY</h2><p data-content-id="JYnuRkNofqaCL_SuH1kdcTdsBjf6Xfa3kN3GnclC0uwXkYmOk2tHLkh0JpDrtZKzP"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57785" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:11">Ezekiel 1:11b</span> says, “Two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.” Here we see that two of their wings are for moving, and this moving is in coordination. By two of their wings they are joined to one another, and in this way they are coordinated. As we have seen, the living creatures use the other two wings to cover themselves. </p>
<p data-content-id="zqHbu0U7uWGsnviHhDYAWewijZt65EDd4MObME8uyyFF5Of7TpcGEbbReHiBZe4IV"> We have also seen that in the Old Testament the eagle’s wings signify the divine power, the divine strength, and the divine supply. This indicates that the coordination of the living creatures is not in themselves. In themselves they do not have the ability to be coordinated. Their coordination is in the divine power, in the divine strength, and in the divine supply because the eagle’s wings are the means for them to be coordinated with one another. Thus, their coordination does not depend on themselves; it does not depend on what they are or on what they can do. Their coordination depends on the eagle’s wings. The eagle’s wings are the means by which they are coordinated and move as one. God Himself is the power <span class="pg" data-page-id="68" id="68">[68]</span> and strength, and it is by this divine power and strength that they are coordinated. </p>
<p data-content-id="TnPiuEpy87hQJz8U3MuApg8E5Y8jxOnarHGWQvC9iBsDYVqVbp5NKVgBsK6amROCx"> The same principle can be seen in the tabernacle. The tabernacle was built of forty-eight boards coordinated into one entity. These boards were coordinated into one building not by themselves but by the overlaying gold (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57786" data-verses="Exodus 26:29-30">Exo. 26:29-30</span>). All the boards were overlaid with gold. Upon the overlaying gold were the golden rings, and through the golden rings were golden bars. The gold, therefore, coordinated all forty-eight boards into one entity. The overlaying gold signifies the divine nature and indicates that God Himself is the coordinating factor that enables all the parts of the divine building to be one. </p>
<p data-content-id="nspAW8ybtAwd-FktD5YN6Ahw4ftVLabqi3PMGvjyYxVnV4VwKoIMl0lUt0qaHwvp9"> In themselves the living creatures are separate and are individuals, but with the eagle’s wings they are coordinated as one body. This indicates that the coordination among us Christians is not something of ourselves. What we have in ourselves does not coordinate—it divides. Whatever we are in ourselves, whatever we have in ourselves, and whatever we do in ourselves result not in coordination but in division and separation. However, we have the eagle’s wings, and with the eagle’s wings we can be one and we can be coordinated. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6qZ5AXEp8asjHStkAiRCeSZuTIzlXOIcRxYU_wF5J7VdKbK50VwX457J7bPXvUbLm">FOR THE LORD’S EXPRESSION, MOVE,<br/>AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p data-content-id="Rrf22uMBNQan9P4T7jHi3bnH-KDQyypij84f2YwjWmMEgM7jEdvf-sug8okDcYg7H"> It is important for us to realize why we need to be coordinated. We must be coordinated as living creatures in order that Christ may be expressed and manifested. Also, the coordination of the living creatures is for the Lord’s move. The Lord moves in the center of the coordination of the living creatures. Furthermore, coordination is the divine administration, the divine government. The throne upon which the Lord is, the throne which is for God’s administration, is in the center of this coordination. Thus, the coordination of the living creatures is for the Lord’s expression and manifestation, for the Lord’s move, and for the divine government. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sTV0uWaZaR7-etDNprDCLy8PFBlH8qHOUJZKsAEyg7zQL_4KVEdzSLh5sv9V5JA-d">THE WAY OF COORDINATION</h2><p data-content-id="wg-jmis-AhzGwVom8C3CVlIDTF3liGiqarrGBZKYNwYK61MYfi1wuCb7PAN8DXDzF"> Now we need to see how the four living creatures are coordinated. Each of the living creatures faces one direction, <span class="pg" data-page-id="69" id="69">[69]</span> respectively facing north, south, east, and west. As they face these four directions, two of their wings spread out and touch the adjacent creatures’ wings, forming a square. Each of the living creatures uses two of his wings to join with other living creatures. </p>
<p data-content-id="L2WIjxRxjPexB4ljS1Z986hkwFKqDMsdmNq-kfPc-ASSG92jR6I00KWKAAuB8m_gB"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57787" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:12">Ezekiel 1:12</span> says, “And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.” Here we see that every one of the living creatures goes straight forward. They do not turn, but some return, that is, move backward. For instance, while one of the living creatures is moving toward the north, the living creature facing the south must return, moving backward. Thus, one goes straight forward while the opposite creature moves backward. At the same time, the other two living creatures must move sideways. One moves sideways to the left, and the other moves sideways to the right. No matter in which direction the living creatures are moving, there is no need for any one of them to turn. One simply goes straight forward; one returns, moving backward; and the other sides move sideways. This is a beautiful picture of the coordination that we need in the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="mGlXzQXS93cQ2872KI0vzuycgdCV-G1UsJYVrLVxuEDM8b9zGL6DI--iW39DhFc3_"> Certain brothers and sisters cannot tolerate being coordinated together. Instead, they prefer to be separated and to do things on their own. As long as they are separated, there is no suffering. Once they are coordinated, there is a kind of suffering, because in coordination there is no freedom or convenience. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZcpsnUdxuzP1fe7xzQYBRVqyh0Mby-sPo0PWrAq-u0JTohcoak0pVDSWjfxazgK4B"> Coordination keeps us from making turns. If one is moving by himself, he may first move to the north and then turn and move to the east. Later he may turn again to move to the south and eventually turn once more and move to the west. He moves in many directions by making many turns. In the Lord’s ministry, on the contrary, there is no such turning. Instead, one moves straight forward, and those who coordinate with him move either backward or sideways. </p>
<p data-content-id="As5RuqkUNs_QiZFPbIMPKbmsJU2jaGSkxZFJj9qFrh1olgghfpp9B3mssRvvCbg_p"> If someone acts without coordination in the church service, doing things on his own, he will make a number of turns. If he functions in the way of doing many different things by himself, it will be necessary for him to make many turns. In the <span class="pg" data-page-id="70" id="70">[70]</span> church service, however, there is no need for turns. Everyone has his function and position. He can simply go straight forward in his function and position. If there is the need to move in another direction, others can take care of that. There is no need for anyone to turn. </p>
<p data-content-id="FIwJ3qsV0mAwigCPE19nHl1AgwBxca5caBJgl1SwOL2Bj2VbKIKDuM59RyUdUoB__"> In the church life we all need to learn not only how to walk straight forward but also how to walk backward (that is, to return) and to walk sideways. Although this may seem quite awkward, we all need to learn this lesson. Otherwise, we cannot be coordinated. </p>
<p data-content-id="C92KRmALSxN5rAScVq8h1bB0yxuAIB1PguamKjHkO2548nR0HClW6SzIeuBtdPCFg"> One problem is that certain brothers and sisters either want to do everything or do nothing at all. Those who want to do everything want to be able to move in every direction. If they are asked to move in a particular direction, they will also want to move in other directions. This means that they want to make a lot of turns. No matter what direction is needed in the church service, they want to be able to walk in that direction. </p>
<p data-content-id="PV2fNgIGsuE-bUFgF7Z0oOSXr-DTxnhBooHdZuUQ9Das4Je1zEiSHqrsJ0upsJB4U"> In the proper coordination there are no turns. You walk straight forward or you either return by walking backward or you walk sideways. It is particularly difficult to walk sideways, and many brothers and sisters are unable to do this. </p>
<p data-content-id="-wKvpHCzaienBNn1FUredwMWje2SNwMXmd0XuRQTF8l38jLFug9nKYw9UAgkaYR6g"> We need the proper coordination in the local churches. In some churches certain brothers and sisters are very capable and make many turns. Others are not very capable, so they do nothing. As a result, there is no coordination. If we would have coordination in the church life, we all need to learn to walk straight forward, to walk backward, and to walk sideways. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="p38LhWt-j07U2iMCnpvTRztj52qmv3mR3L5H63FoAbrSm3ahMmnisRyTT9j-cFYQW">COORDINATION IN MINISTRY</h2><p data-content-id="v8e1FNT-phHR2DucAbCpb1nsb__K-HGbsUyvlVBbqjrDFw4byAhaNfrI7B0v1zrtp"> If in a local church one brother has a ministry to preach the gospel and another has a ministry to build up the saints, they must coordinate. Otherwise, they may cause a problem. If there were only one ministry—the ministry of preaching the gospel of building up the saints—there would be little or no problem. However, if brothers with different ministries do not know how to coordinate, they will compete and may even strive against each other. The brother who is burdened for the gospel may contend for the outreach and the increase, and he <span class="pg" data-page-id="71" id="71">[71]</span> may try to convince others to join him. The brother who is burdened for the building up of the saints may criticize the one who is burdened for the gospel, claiming that he brings in new ones but does not care for them. Then he might encourage others to help him to take care of the new ones. The result of this lack of coordination between these two brothers may be division, with some concerned only for the gospel and others concerned only for shepherding. </p>

<p data-content-id="7dtg_xWd_1oVROwVwjxL53zd78HBvmuWOR1SM6eDsY7qUofk88XbvGJSfbzR4yZMY"> Concerning the vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57797" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">chapter one</span> of Ezekiel, we have paid close attention to the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum, to the four faces of the living creatures—the faces of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle—and to the eagle’s wings, the man’s hands, and the calf’s hoofs. In the previous message we began to consider the coordination of the four living creatures, and in this message we will consider this matter further. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_mRKRptREFnggL-PU4CvKQmjWmnwVg0KRxmxiSAqvoNRoVSn3LxL5lR9p8SgEoUoB">GOD’S EXPRESSION, MOVE, AND ADMINISTRATION<br/>FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF HIS PURPOSE</h2><p data-content-id="BIuz1ZsNpSVEtpe_c5-r1r96n7K9YkuX1Qe6UHpVubV30a2gTCokxsb0a78hLe8d5"> It is crucial for us to realize that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57798" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">Ezekiel 1</span> shows us the desire of God’s heart and unveils to us the purpose that God wants to accomplish. As we read this chapter, we may think that it speaks merely about four living creatures. However, if we read this chapter carefully, we will see that it speaks of God’s desire to be expressed in His Son. The four faces of the living creatures signify the complete and adequate expression of Christ. Furthermore, the four living creatures with their four faces signify a coordinated, corporate entity, the corporate Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57799" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:12">1 Cor. 12:12</span>). This corporate Christ is the corporate expression of God among human beings. </p>
<p data-content-id="xpNFS3cnmgvzIaDTu2KkVHoEqw7kbcA-vKEI4I9BgDZLERtmA4_nBIxGCUirLQktl"> The four living creatures exist for at least three reasons. First, these living creatures are for God’s expression. God in the Son wants to express Himself among men. Second, the living creatures are for God’s move. As they coordinate together, they are full of burning, shining, and enlightening, <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> and the great and high wheel, which is for God’s move, follows them. This one entity composed of four living creatures is both for God’s expression and His move. Their expression of God is for the move of God. Third, the living creatures are for God’s administration. Over their heads was the likeness of an expanse, or a firmament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57800" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:22">Ezek. 1:22</span>), and “above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57801" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:26">v. 26</span>). The throne is for God’s ruling, God’s administration. When God has His expression, move, and administration, He can manifest Himself in His glory and complete His eternal purpose and plan. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZN_01ZRAZsGzinFwLFI9F7bgSAk6hy_uYn-1RTJR1luDvjvzFq4qNaKHBKyV5NFD"> Today many Christians think that the reason for believing in the Lord Jesus is that they may have peace and well being in the present and that in the future they may go to heaven to enjoy eternal bliss. This thought falls far short of the divine revelation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57802" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">Ezekiel 1</span> God reveals that He needs a group of living creatures who can coordinate together as one entity for His expression, move, and administration. When God gains such a corporate expression, His purpose will be accomplished. </p>
<p data-content-id="d4dzE-7ip2KH-msJg1h1GImHGoowj1cY4NugEh16_n8sHykLV7fOjxuCtjBE2lIwE"> In the church life God’s plan is fulfilled on a small scale. We who have received grace and have experienced the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum are a group of living creatures with four faces to express Christ. We have God’s grace and power as the wings for both moving and covering. We also have the calf’s hoofs and thereby have a walk that is full of discernment, enlightening, and freshness. Now we can be coordinated together for God’s expression, move, and administration. If this is our situation in the church life, then when others contact us, they will say, “God is among you.” There needs to be such an expression of Christ in the church life today. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qd35Oici55jXFQ4TZ0gj7k52W8-ACboj_XWOxcttDFSmUnID-mvJb4Zav1g9e0C6A"> Regarding the coordination of the living creatures, there are five points that we need to consider: the basis of coordination, the need of coordination, the prerequisites of coordination, the practical condition of coordination, and the result of coordination. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KoVbp6lsJDUeqDS2edMNs8JPMCiLEUJGTddYMb8btjSk16Qd0kAVfs-qPqF9MAp6E">THE BASIS OF COORDINATION</h2><p data-content-id="l9G_FRwnnsPJj3AhWzxE_GZyAfriGMotQr6dTzF_0AH1ohdNbcgm_L7axAmUn1xY6"> The basis of the coordination of the living creatures has a number of aspects. <span class="pg" data-page-id="81" id="81">[81]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Og7UyqSl0aJ0cDVx9zF6BHQU2Ckmqh4EuqGPEZPgJGx22PnoJnULS4DqVm50PXQyB">All Being out of Christ</h2><p data-content-id="4DeMWmLxu4b-lDGo37i2237TgbVzWN4EnLwWFLSDvmDsqxMC4sc0dt6rBw6Gtfsyn"> The basis of our coordination as living creatures is, first, that we all are out of Christ. You are out of Christ and I am out of Christ; therefore, we can coordinate together. </p>
<p data-content-id="ofbGyEjAxjN2AROrgUyqsMrUDR--wpexrdoqYKmUhns76yxJ-WKrBWbHDNs8KMasj"> By His blood the Lord has purchased us for God “out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57803" data-verses="Revelation 5:9">Rev. 5:9</span>). No matter what our race or nationality may be, we all are out of Christ and we can coordinate together as one entity in Christ. If we were not of Christ and if we were not in Christ, we could not coordinate together. But although in Adam we have many differences, in Christ we can be blended together and we can coordinate together. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="3ADnnUCyZIFQmColjSiiMalqvWoqq531s45-fiZptKzEeli67cXRD129xg1t3yvLL">Having the Same Life</h2><p data-content-id="G8YLfHFDiG7w35WoxHmRqi-A17FpWf0ygLEo09AQnh7gt7KesIFcUM0gixTROzO2D"> We are not only out of Christ—we also have the same life, the life of Christ. Outwardly we are quite different, but inwardly we all have Christ as our life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57804" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">Col. 3:4</span>). Therefore, we have the same life. </p>
<p data-content-id="cfNKR6_Ikj5gcAUgF2D1HvDH7jIhISr-RTlqIDpKhpHf6bnYGXOfPNwozn6omLk5q"> In 1933 I visited some Japanese brothers and sisters in the Lord. I could not understand Japanese, and they could not understand Chinese. Nevertheless, when we knelt down to pray together, we had a sense of freshness and sweetness in our spirits. This indicates that we, the living creatures, all are out of Christ and that we all have the same life, the life of Christ. If we reject everything that is not Christ, we will be one entity in Christ and we will be able to coordinate together. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Y6VPJt1oDg8WbmA7biITOwTWZfuc88cF2EKdOPvQBDrnx0Sx5TXxBKCVwq3Eo1b_t">Having the Same Heart to Express Christ</h2><p data-content-id="EozqjcK3WHH7oN8cuyeAK4pZQ9AbTidaE9HxDWd_xQtr_HoZoj_xVW3P53sr-ZAZx"> Another aspect of the basis of coordination is having the same heart’s desire to express Christ. Deep within many believers, including those who have fallen away from Him, is the desire to express Christ and glorify Him. To glorify the Lord, to express Him, is to live Him out. As a genuine living creature, every Christian who has experienced the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum has such a desire to express Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Dt4ZXNpkb1rmwOkLQFgJ53QRKQS69GVaCuSbypSfdx1T1kR7gOoqEPDVRFavwwa4V"> The basis of our coordination is that we are out of Christ, that we have the life of Christ, and that we wish to glorify Christ and express Christ. Now, because of this, we can coordinate together. <span class="pg" data-page-id="82" id="82">[82]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="SdACyeUFvYVZos1f4owDhCQJzFRTY6Yz4Byr-rS8Ov6KY4c_9XQ5zHiuRMmT8ec4o"> A proverb says, “Birds of a feather flock together.” Since we all are out of Christ and have the same life and the same desire to express Christ, we are “birds of a feather” and we “flock together” to become one entity in Christ. This is the basis of our coordination. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="g_0wEyFGf5iHyh2oYzPFUfR0aDiN6PMtnbwSWO8UaSIUu-Mv80Rrfn0O9tErFjOtz">THE NECESSITY OF COORDINATION</h2><p data-content-id="eEfMgHWo1dWZ0DidRr1yOSoNKgd9xexduNkkPs8a7-zsUc3SyJyc5YfURXamXrJQP"> I hope that every believer will understand that we cannot be Christians in isolation. Basically, as believers in Christ we are a collective entity, and we cannot do anything alone. The vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57805" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">Ezekiel 1</span> shows us that we need to be corporate and that we need to be in coordination. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="5B77wnH1FzY8BLTY6fCXJJg8fGvk2y-0-wcSHFSE7ZmUp0tp06z5YVYlyz-mtu8g6">Necessary for God’s Expression</h2><p data-content-id="NRHnpckJ6kUzVbbOlq4UttjhWxss0xCY8-NMDod05m56iu8RUUufdxZWFCU9NFkvw"> Coordination is necessary for God’s expression. We have pointed out that the four living creatures are for God’s expression in Christ. In order for God to have a corporate expression of Himself in Christ, we need to be joined together and knit together with all the saints and thereby become one entity. If we are isolated, we cannot express Christ adequately. </p>
<p data-content-id="t8I9sHpJ7S0cz__sqMkC7T2_2-qYvi-xEyhSUjmX-nxUewXzrG6j2mAcXlH_K87nH"> Each of the living creatures has four faces. However, if we were to look at the living creatures one by one, we could not see all four faces at the same time. Only when the living creatures are coordinated together can we see all four faces simultaneously. This indicates that as individual believers we cannot express Christ completely and adequately. For the corporate expression of Christ, we need to be joined together, knit together, and coordinated together. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="hcD2jLAk2Q_I5adxkIUEZrv7MmIgxfodbVTqRxpuLmJmSrEo35x0gZeqOh4O0u4mK">Necessary for God’s Move</h2><p data-content-id="UANm6l8X60Ln81YDphtJepKCKVVvd6_GJKp7S1vl6365tIU4hsCnLJVxdEpfXhTLP"> Coordination is also necessary for God’s move. The spreading of the gospel of God, the advancement of God’s move on earth, the execution of God’s will, the progress of the church of God—all this requires coordination. It is impossible for us to accomplish these things as individual Christians. Through our experience in serving the Lord, we have learned that coordination is necessary for every aspect of God’s move. The great wheel of God moves according to the coordination of the living creatures. <span class="pg" data-page-id="83" id="83">[83]</span> </p>

First we have the wind and this is followed by the cloud, the fire, and the electrum. Then the living creatures appear with four faces to express Christ in a corporate way. Next we have the eagle’s wings, the man’s hands, and the calf’s hoofs. All this is for the coordination. The living creatures move in a coordinated way. This chapter goes on to speak of the fire going up and down and of the burning coals and the burning torches. After all this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57825" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:15-21">verses 15 through 21</span> describe the high and dreadful wheels. By the side of every living creature there is a wheel. This wheel is so high that it is dreadful; it is dreadfully high. In this message we will consider the significance of the high and dreadful wheels. </p>
<p data-content-id="4DeMWmLxu4b-lDGo37i223rTnIVzWN4EnLwWFLSDvmDsqxMC4sc0dt6rBw6Gtfsyn"> A wheel is for moving, not in an ordinary way but in a special way. At home, when we walk from the kitchen to our bedroom or living room, we do not need a wheel. But when we travel a distance, we need a wheel. When we do something to fulfill a purpose, we may also need a wheel. Thus, the move by a wheel is not an ordinary move but a special move with a purpose. The wheel in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57826" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">Ezekiel 1</span> implies a move with a purpose. Furthermore, the wheel implies that this move is not by our own strength. </p>

They are for the corporate expression of Christ, and thus they express Christ in a corporate way. The Lord on the throne looks like a man, and the four living creatures expressing the Lord also look like a man. The Lord <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> on the throne looks like burning fire, and the four living creatures also look like burning fire. From this we see that the living creatures are the expression of the Lord. Whatever the Lord is, they express. The Lord is living, and they also are living. The Lord is the living God, and they are the living creatures. Whatever the Lord is, they are. Whatever the Lord expresses, they also express. Therefore, the four living creatures are the expression of the Lord. </p>

<p data-content-id="As5RuqkUNs_QiZFPbIMPKYGsJW2jaGSkxZFJj9qFrh1olgghfpp9B3mssRvvCbg_p"> Whenever a church is proper, expresses the Lord, and has the proper coordination with the fire going up and down, the move of the Lord will be with that church. However, if a church claims to be proper and yet has no move of the Lord, something is wrong. If there is no increase in number year after year and no growth in life among the members, there is no move with that church. With those in that church there is neither increase nor spread. This indicates there is something wrong with that church. If a church is proper, it will have a great wheel at its side. </p>

Everyone will see the move of this wheel. If a church claims to have the move of the Lord, this may indicate that it does not actually have the Lord’s move. When a church has the move of the Lord, no one needs to declare, “Look at the move of the Lord among us.” If there is a move, it will be manifest to all. Everyone can see the great wheel, high and dreadful, for it is at the side of the living creatures for all to see. The wheel is simply there. </p>

These prophets and teachers were living creatures coordinating together and having the burning coals and the burning torches. They fulfilled all the requirements in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57830" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">Ezekiel 1</span> related to being in the Lord’s move. Thus, the move of the great wheel was with them. </p>

First, they can move by flying because they have the wings of an eagle. They can also move by walking on the calf’s hoofs. These two ways of moving are an ordinary move. But when they need to move in a special way, they move by a wheel. </p>
<p data-content-id="WfEVbagx2vme1BiQhHb5BlY_rxXwiPb1Nstsb4tLT0KnncoTQeDqZVNZPsaUBaDG-"> On your job you need to move daily by the eagle’s wings and the calf’s hoofs. If you move in this way, your co-workers will see that with you there is something powerful. You can suffer things which others cannot suffer and you can endure things which others cannot endure because you have the eagle’s wings. They can also realize that in your character and behavior you are honest, straight, frank, and sincere, having no crookedness. They will see the eagle’s wings and the calf’s hoofs upon you, and thus they will be convicted by you in their conscience. </p>
<p data-content-id="2PYXRuBRbk3pazLkKTlYvDUinSwv15ApCa1VN8KxIix8cbBt0J74ZrjjS6AX6gZ1X"> In addition to this kind of move with you on your job, there should also be another kind of move—an extraordinary move, the move of a wheel. Eventually, because the move of the wheel is with you, some of your co-workers may be gained by the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="uLbh7taL_7-XoK9Q8ONqOxoE8gPJobsJZa-NymaFABQVYF3nbW2_GsMshc2YHU6b6"> If you should work at a job for several years and nothing happens for the Lord’s interests, this indicates that with you there is no move of the Lord. You may consider yourself spiritual and heavenly, but you are lacking the wheel. If there is no move of the Lord with you, it is questionable whether you have the eagle’s wings, the man’s hands, and the calf’s hoofs. This may indicate that while you are at work, you are somewhat worldly and that you are not a proper human being; <span class="pg" data-page-id="94" id="94">[94]</span> therefore, the move of the Lord is not with you. But if you have the eagle’s wings, the man’s hands, and the calf’s hoofs, there will surely be a wheel beside you. The move of the Lord will be with you. </p>
<p data-content-id="fLosXWms1KYdGPCBWfcZMXSDy9uQ_A9Ht8UGClPEeBQVlDGoJcH_conm1QNn2Q_o4"> Wherever we go, there should be a high and dreadful wheel by us. If we move to a certain city, there should be a wheel in that city. If we move to a particular country, there should be a wheel in that country. The presence of the wheel will prove that we are proper, that is, that we have the eagle’s wings, the man’s hands, and the calf’s hoofs. As we have pointed out, if we do not have the eagle’s wings, the man’s hands, and the calf’s hoofs, we are not qualified to have a wheel standing beside us. </p>
<p data-content-id="IX_UvHDiNQNKuMzDpACM6yMR9KWjmOXo9otBId5AM2tk46g0M3mHb3T-Twt1do4v1"> If we would have the wheel, we need to be the proper living creatures. This means that we need to experience the blowing of the wind, the overshadowing of the Spirit, and the burning of the Spirit in order to gain much electrum. We also need to have the four faces expressing Christ in an adequate way and the eagle’s wings by which we can move and behave in a divine way. Furthermore, we need the calf’s hoofs in order to walk in a straight and sincere way, in a way that convinces others and commends us to their conscience. If this is our situation, then certainly there will be a high and dreadful wheel beside us. This wheel is the move of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ha_9caqJ-gtW20LDfXmwcWgsXpXon1Pc0q0siMVKOik-gRx59IRw2r9MVWNDzyftI"> Consider the apostle Paul.

Even his name, Paul, means “little.” Paul was a little man, yet with him there were the eagle’s wings, the man’s hands, and the calf’s hoofs. Thus, wherever he went, there was a great, high, and dreadful wheel. The situation should be the same with us today. We should have the eagle’s wings, the man’s hands, and the calf’s hoofs, and thereby have a great wheel for the Lord’s move. </p>

<p data-content-id="g_0wEyFGf5iHyh2oYzPFVdR0dQSN6PMtnbwSWO8UaSIUu-Mv80Rrfn0O9tErFjOtz"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57848" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:22-25">Ezekiel 1:22-25</span> is very profound and deep. These verses tell us that upon the heads of the four living creatures there is the firmament, or the expanse, which we call the sky. The appearance of the sky is like terrible crystal. It is so clear that it looks terrible. This sky stretches forth over the heads of all the creatures. Under this sky the living creatures stretch their two wings straight. In a previous message we saw that two of the wings of each of the living creatures are stretched forth and joined to the wings of others. The living creatures use their other two wings to cover their body. Whenever they move and whenever they act, a voice, or a sound, comes from their wings. This voice is like the noise of great waters and also like “the voice of the Almighty” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57849" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:24">v. 24</span>), that is, the Almighty God. It is also like the voice of tumult, the voice of a host or army. (The word <em>host</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57850" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:24">verse 24</span> means “an army.”) Furthermore, when the living creatures stop and stand still, they lower their wings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57851" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:25">v. 25</span>). We need to consider the spiritual significance and application of all these matters. If we do not understand this spiritual significance and application, then to us these points may appear either nonsensical or meaningless. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="eEfMgHWo1dWZ0DidRr1yPQoNOzd9xexduNkkPs8a7-zsUc3SyJyc5YfURXamXrJQP">BASED ON ALL THE PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES</h2><p data-content-id="5B77wnH1FzY8BLTY6fCXILg8aV_k2y-0-wcSHFSE7ZmUp0tp06z5YVYlyz-mtu8g6"> These verses are based on the preceding verses. This means that we first need to experience the blowing wind, which brings in the cloud of the Lord’s presence to overshadow us. As we enjoy the Lord’s presence, the cloud brings in the burning fire, and we experience the burning. Out of the burning fire, we gain the electrum, and then we become living <span class="pg" data-page-id="102" id="102">[102]</span> creatures. As living creatures, we move in coordination with others to express Christ. We have four faces to express the all-inclusive Christ in a corporate way. In order to have these four faces, we need to be dealt with by the cross. Following this, we need to experience and enjoy the eagle’s wings; that is, we move by the divine power and strength and by the grace of Christ. We also cover ourselves, hiding ourselves under His overshadowing wings, hiding ourselves under the grace and power of Christ. Furthermore, we need to learn to work as a man by using the man’s hands and also learn to walk on the calf’s straight feet, having a walk that is straight, frank, honest, sincere, and faithful. This will qualify us to be in coordination. Within the coordination we will have the fire up and down, the burning coals, and the enlightening torches. When we reach this point, the holy God as a consuming fire will be among us in a corporate way. Then there will be a high and dreadful wheel beside us, indicating that we have God’s move on earth by us and with us. Within this wheel is a wheel, signifying that within our move is the Lord’s move. He is moving within us. By having such a wheel, such a move, we will be full of eyes and have insight and foresight. Now we need to see that when we have all these matters in our experience, we will have a clear sky and a very particular sound—the sound of great waters, a sound that is the voice of the Almighty. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NRHnpckJ6kUzVbbOlq4UsvjhchMs0xCY8-NMDod05m56iu8RUUufdxZWFCU9NFkvw">A CLEAR SKY, EXPANDING AND STABLE</h2><p data-content-id="t8I9sHpJ7S0cz__sqMkC6R2_9uaYvi-xEyhSUjmX-nxUewXzrG6j2mAcXlH_K87nH"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57852" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:22">Ezekiel 1:22</span> says, “The likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the color of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.” This reveals that after we have experienced all the things in the first twenty-one verses, the sky over our heads will be crystal clear. It will be like a great expanse of crystal. We will have a wide, clear expanse above us. This means that above us is an open, clear heaven. </p>
<p data-content-id="3ADnnUCyZIFQmColjSiiNYlqvUoqq531s45-fiZptKzEeli67cXRD129xg1t3yvLL"> The sky is not only clear; it is also expanding. It is not just a matter of having a clear sky vertically, from heaven to earth, but also a matter of having a clear sky horizontally. This means that the clear sky is expanding. Our sky, therefore, should be clear and expanding. <span class="pg" data-page-id="103" id="103">[103]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="G8YLfHFDiG7w35WoxHmRrg-A15FpWf0ygLEo09AQnh7gt7KesIFcUM0gixTROzO2D"> Before we were saved, our sky was dark and cloudy, even foggy. It was also narrow, without any expanse. With us there was hardly any heaven, hardly any sky. But one day we repented, confessed our sins, and received the Lord Jesus as our Savior. The more we confessed our sins, the more clear our sky became. After we made a thorough confession, we had the sense, for the first time, that the sky above us was clear. We sensed that the day was dawning, that the clouds were leaving, and that the fog was lifting. When we were saved, we received not only a clear sky but also an expanding sky. We had the sense that our sky was expanding. </p>
<p data-content-id="cfNKR6_Ikj5gcAUgF2D1GtDH4johISr-RTlqIDpKhpHf6bnYGXOfPNwozn6omLk5q"> Later, however, some problems might have arisen with ourselves personally, with our relatives, with the church, or with some of the brothers and sisters. Immediately our sky became somewhat cloudy again. It was not as cloudy and dark as before we were saved, but still it was no longer clear. Clouds and fog reappeared. We all have had this kind of experience. Eventually, we confessed our failures, condemned such things as our attitudes, motives, intentions, and goals, and received God’s forgiveness and the cleansing of the blood of Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57853" data-verses="1John 1:9">1 John 1:9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57854" data-verses="1John 1:7">7</span>). The sky above us became clear again, and once again we were under a clear sky. Then the sky began to open and expand above us. In our experience we should always have a clear, open, and expanding heaven. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y6VPJt1oDg8WbmA7biITPyTWafOc88cF2EKdOPvQBDrnx0Sx5TXxBKCVwq3Eo1b_t"> The kind of sky a Christian has depends upon his conscience. Your conscience is connected to your sky. If there is no blemish on your conscience, your sky will be clear. If your sky is not clear, this means that there is some offense on your conscience. In order to have a clear sky, we need to deal with any offense and condemnation in our conscience. The story of our sky is the story of our conscience. </p>
<p data-content-id="EozqjcK3WHH7oN8cuyeAL6pZT8gbTidaE9HxDWd_xQtr_HoZoj_xVW3P53sr-ZAZx"> When we as living creatures reach the point of having a clear, open, and expanding heaven, there will be nothing between us and God and nothing between us and one another. There will be nothing cloudy or foggy covering us or separating us from one another. All the clouds, coverings, separations, and fog will be gone, and we will have a sky that is thoroughly clear and continually expanding. Our expanse will be as clear as crystal. When others look upon our clear <span class="pg" data-page-id="104" id="104">[104]</span> sky, they will be astonished. Our sky is terrible because it is crystal clear and expanding. </p>
<p data-content-id="Dt4ZXNpkb1rmwOkLQFgJ41QRJRy69GVaCuSbypSfdx1T1kR7gOoqEPDVRFavwwa4V"> This clear and expanding sky is also stable. As a rule, the sky above the earth usually has some kind of movement. Either the clouds are moving or the wind is blowing. But the sky above the living creatures is not moving; rather, it is as stable as crystal. There is no change. </p>
<p data-content-id="SdACyeUFvYVZos1f4owDgAQJwFxTY6Yz4Byr-rS8Ov6KY4c_9XQ5zHiuRMmT8ec4o"> We need to consider this in light of our experience. At the time we were saved, we had a clear sky. However, we enjoyed such a sky only for a short time. Like the weather in certain places, our sky fluctuated very much. Sometimes our sky became cloudy, but after we confessed our sins, it became clear again. Later we would have another failure, such as losing our temper, and our sky would become cloudy once again. There were many fluctuations in the sky above our head. </p>
<p data-content-id="g_0wEyFGf5iHyh2oYzPFVdR0ZDCN6PMtnbwSWO8UaSIUu-Mv80Rrfn0O9tErFjOtz"> With the living creatures, however, the situation is altogether different. The sky above the heads of the living creatures is perfectly stable, like crystal. There is no fluctuation. The heaven above them is clear, expanding, and stable. They have a thorough fellowship with the Lord vertically and also a clear fellowship among themselves horizontally. They have a wide and stable span of fellowship. </p>
<p data-content-id="eEfMgHWo1dWZ0DidRr1yPQoNJj99xexduNkkPs8a7-zsUc3SyJyc5YfURXamXrJQP"> A proper local church should be like this. Unfortunately, however, the sky in some local churches seems to be cloudy and narrow. The sky over that church is very small and narrow. There is no expanse, and the situation is dark and touchy, making it difficult for anyone to say anything. If you say anything in this touchy situation, some of the saints will be offended. No matter what you say, certain ones will be unhappy with you. However, if a local church is proper, the sky over it will be clear and broad. No matter what you say, no one will be offended. </p>

<p data-content-id="1ndPv8fkswHQhtHDIW5BrROYLReHWyFmZNb9_KLPYegjxTwNUHMra6t8sEFG8knNv"> In the vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57876" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">chapter one</span> things in the natural realm are used to describe things in the spiritual realm. These spiritual things are deep, but we can understand them through the natural and physical things that are used to describe them. According to God’s plan the spiritual things revealed here begin with the wind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57877" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:4">v. 4</span>) and end with the rainbow (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57878" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:28">v. 28</span>). As we will see in the next message, there is a rainbow that manifests God’s splendor. In our experience, the throne (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57879" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:26">v. 26</span>) and the rainbow both depend on our having a sky that is crystal clear. </p>
<p data-content-id="9ijk45dscac4Wlmzclqwwx7P5pfiy2-Am9tCXkwHT7HfH7cIo2T26IlH4uk-xtqu6"> In the last message we saw that above the heads of the living creatures is a clear firmament, a clear sky, that is expanding and yet was stable. Now in this message we need to see that above this clear sky there is a throne. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57880" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:26">Ezekiel 1:26</span> says, “Above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.” We need to consider the meaning of the throne and apply it to our experience. </p>

This means that we need always to have a clear fellowship with Him. We should have nothing between us and the Lord. When there is nothing between us and the Lord, our sky will be crystal clear, and our conscience will be pure, void of any offense (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57881" data-verses="Acts 24:16">Acts 24:16</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="nspAW8ybtAwd-FktD5YN7BBwwNdVLabqi3PMGvjyYxVnV4VwKoIMl0lUt0qaHwvp9"> We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that if, as <span class="pg" data-page-id="112" id="112">[112]</span> Christians, we would have a clear sky, a crystal heaven, before the Lord, we need to have a conscience that is without offense. Whenever there is condemnation or an offense on our conscience, our sky immediately becomes cloudy, darkened, and foggy. At such times we should confess our failure and our sin to the Lord and receive His forgiveness and the cleansing of His precious blood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57882" data-verses="1John 1:9">1 John 1:9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57883" data-verses="1John 1:7">7</span>). This will cleanse our conscience so that it will be void of offense. We will again have a clear sky and a clear fellowship with the Lord, with nothing between us and Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="WfEVbagx2vme1BiQhHb5AnY_rzXwiPb1Nstsb4tLT0KnncoTQeDqZVNZPsaUBaDG-"> Sometimes a small matter, such as a poor attitude toward our spouse, can cause us to have clouds in our sky. Perhaps the other party is wrong, but our attitude is also wrong, and we lose our joy and our peace. Also, we may have no anointing to pray for a period of time. Our conscience begins to condemn us and bother us. This is the loss of a clear Christian sky, the loss of a clear heaven. We no longer have a clear heaven over us, because something is wrong between us and the Lord. This situation will remain until we go to the Lord and ask His forgiveness for our bad attitude. Then the Lord’s anointing within us may cause us to sense that we need to confess and apologize to our spouse. Although we may hesitate, because we have lost the Lord’s presence, eventually we confess, apologize, and ask for forgiveness. As soon as we do this, the “weather” changes; the clouds disappear, and the clear sky returns. Something within us is living once again, and we can praise the Lord. Once more we have a clear sky, a sky like the firmament of terrible crystal over the heads of the living creatures. We should have this kind of experience not only in our daily life but also in the church life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2PYXRuBRbk3pazLkKTlYuBUinQwv15ApCa1VN8KxIix8cbBt0J74ZrjjS6AX6gZ1X">A CLEAR SKY AND THE THRONE</h2><p data-content-id="uLbh7taL_7-XoK9Q8ONqPzoE_gvJobsJZa-NymaFABQVYF3nbW2_GsMshc2YHU6b6"> Whenever we have such a clear sky in our Christian life and in our church life, we will also have the throne, which is above the clear sky (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57884" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:26">Ezek. 1:26</span>). The throne is the center of the universe, and it is where the Lord is. We often talk about the Lord’s presence, but we need to realize that the Lord’s presence is always with the throne. Where the Lord is, there His throne is. His presence can never be separated from His <span class="pg" data-page-id="113" id="113">[113]</span> throne. The Lord’s throne is in the third heaven, but His throne is also in our spirit. Hence, the Lord’s throne is with us all the time. </p>
<p data-content-id="fLosXWms1KYdGPCBWfcZNVSDx9OQ_A9Ht8UGClPEeBQVlDGoJcH_conm1QNn2Q_o4"> As Christians and as local churches, we all should be under a crystal clear and expansive sky. Above this clear, expansive sky is the throne of the Lord. By having such a clear sky, we are spontaneously under the government of the Lord’s throne. Now we are under the ruling and reigning of the throne. </p>
<p data-content-id="IX_UvHDiNQNKuMzDpACM7wMR-L2jmOXo9otBId5AM2tk46g0M3mHb3T-Twt1do4v1"> We should always be under the ruling of the Lord’s throne. Because we are under the throne, we do not need policemen and law courts to rule over us. If we need to be ruled by the police and by the courts, this means that we are not under the throne. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ha_9caqJ-gtW20LDfXmwdUgsUo3on1Pc0q0siMVKOik-gRx59IRw2r9MVWNDzyftI"> We should be under the throne of the Lord all the time. Perhaps we want to say a certain thing, but the ruling of the throne does not allow us to speak a word. As we begin to speak, the throne exercises its ruling, and we are forced to swallow our words. At other times, we may become angry and may be close to losing our temper, but we realize that we are under the ruling of the throne, and we are subdued. Who is ruling over us? We are ruled not merely by the teachings of the Bible but by the throne. </p>
<p data-content-id="XepL-yKvCOMfBVF1zePEm2vxKMnDxci6eLedCPyLziLypB00oXRDxbo8XzhFKTQ4h"> In our Christian life and in our church life, if the sky is clear, the throne will be there. But if our sky is cloudy and darkened, we will not see the throne. When we do not see the throne, we can be loose and do many things according to our taste and convenience. Today many believers are careless in their daily Christian life because they do not have a clear sky with the throne above it. Whenever believers are in darkness and thus are not under the throne, they can be quite loose, speaking what they want to speak, expressing what they want to express, and going where they want to go. But a person who is under the throne has no liberty to behave in such a way. </p>
<p data-content-id="k4Ajjh-9TG5V-Yz5rWAXz5npuVQD6qGu0sspdVg7meIXyXNW5MC3fw76TFIIoEuvx"> In a sense, because we have been saved, we are liberated, but in another sense we are under the throne and have no liberty at all. I can testify that sometimes I wanted to go to a certain place, but because of the throne I did not have the <span class="pg" data-page-id="114" id="114">[114]</span> liberty to go there. Praise the Lord for the clear sky and for the throne! Above our heads is the firmament, and above the firmament is the throne. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="JYnuRkNofqaCL_SuH1kddS9sIz_6Xfa3kN3GnclC0uwXkYmOk2tHLkh0JpDrtZKzP">THE HIGHEST SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE—<br/>HAVING THE THRONE IN OUR FIRMAMENT</h2><p data-content-id="zqHbu0U7uWGsnviHhDYAXfQirJd65EDd4MObME8uyyFF5Of7TpcGEbbReHiBZe4IV"> The highest step in the spiritual experience of a Christian is to have the throne in our firmament, in our clear sky. To have the throne, or to arrive at the throne, is to allow God to have the highest and most prominent position in our Christian life. For God to have the throne in us means that He has the position to reign in us. Therefore, to reach the throne in our spiritual experience means that in everything we are completely submissive to God’s authority and administration. Then we are no longer a person without the throne, without authority, without government. </p>
<p data-content-id="aO4fP_PJksfCXqSijn9t0i-BO5zAdwfYZbIFme-3od23Mf0x5MkBQvzpVrexMT24W"> A believer who does not have a clear sky with a throne above it can easily be loose and careless in his daily living. On the contrary, a believer who has a sky that is crystal clear has the sense of being under divine government and restraint; therefore, he cannot be loose or careless in anything he says or does. A believer who has a clear sky above him is under an authority which restricts and restrains him in things such as speaking or a display of anger. This authority is a matter of the throne. </p>
<p data-content-id="bdSLpeqsU89fPsdy5AnMsTqy5q1M9m_hi3bf9lycl88fNhg1oeUrZ3wbkkhWUYCI7"> The clearer our firmament is, the more we are under the throne. The more we have clear fellowship with the Lord, the more we will be under His authority. We need to ask ourselves if there is a throne in our Christian life. If we have the throne above the clear sky, we are greatly blessed, and we should worship God for this blessing. </p>

<p data-content-id="mGlXzQXS93cQ2872KI0vyvickOSV-G1UsJYVrLVxuEDM8b9zGL6DI--iW39DhFc3_"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that in the Christian life and in the church life we need a clear sky with a throne in it. To have a clear sky means that we have no clouds or darkness between us and the Lord, and to have the throne means that we are under the ruling of the heavens. We all need to have a life with a clear sky and the throne above the clear sky. In this message we will go on to consider the One sitting on the throne (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57904" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:26-27">Ezek. 1:26-27</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZcpsnUdxuzP1fe7xzQYBQU6ymksby-sPo0PWrAq-u0JTohcoak0pVDSWjfxazgK4B">THE ONE ON THE THRONE<br/>HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF A MAN</h2><p data-content-id="As5RuqkUNs_QiZFPbIMPLa2sPEGjaGSkxZFJj9qFrh1olgghfpp9B3mssRvvCbg_p"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57905" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:26">Verse 26b</span> says, “Upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.” Here we are told that the One on the throne looks like a man. This is absolutely different from the human concept and also different from the religious concept, including the concept widely held in today’s Christianity. Mainly, our concept is that the One on the throne is the mighty God. Have you ever thought that the Lord on the throne is not only the mighty God but is also a man? Oh, the One who sits on the throne is a man! However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57906" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:28">verse 28</span> speaks of “the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.” The One on the throne looks like a man, yet with Him there is the appearance of the glory of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="FIwJ3qsV0mAwigCPE19nGklAqihxca5caBJgl1SwOL2Bj2VbKIKDuM59RyUdUoB__"> Christians realize, of course, that the Lord Jesus was a man when He was on this earth. They recognize the fact that from the manger in Bethlehem to the time He was on the cross at Golgotha He was a man. We all have this concept. However, many believers in Christ have not considered that <span class="pg" data-page-id="124" id="124">[124]</span> the Lord who is on the throne today is still a man. He is a man there. As the One on the throne, the Lord is still a man. Although He is the almighty God, on the throne He looks like a man. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57907" data-verses="Matthew 19:28">Matthew 19:28</span> tells us that “in the restoration,” that is, in the coming kingdom age, the Son of Man will be sitting on the throne of His glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="C92KRmALSxN5rAScVq8h0aR05jeAIB1PguamKjHkO2548nR0HClW6SzIeuBtdPCFg"> How precious it is that the One sitting on the throne in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57908" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:26">Ezekiel 1:26</span> has the appearance of a man! This verse speaks not of the almighty God but of One who has “the likeness as the appearance of a man.” There is at least a twofold significance to the fact that the One sitting on the throne here has the appearance of a man. First, there is surely a connection between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57909" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:26">Ezekiel 1:26</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57910" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span>, which says that God created man in His own image and according to His likeness. Second, in the incarnation God Himself became a man. Having the nature of man, He lived, died, resurrected, and ascended as a man, and now in heaven He is still the Son of Man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57911" data-verses="John 6:62">John 6:62</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57912" data-verses="Acts 7:56">Acts 7:56</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="eEfMgHWo1dWZ0DidRr1yPQINJh99xexduNkkPs8a7-zsUc3SyJyc5YfURXamXrJQP"> In the Bible there is a mysterious thought concerning the relationship between God and man. God’s desire is to become the same as man is and to make man the same as He is. This means that God’s intention is to mingle Himself with man and thereby make Himself like man and make man like Him. The Lord Jesus is the God-man; He is the complete God and the perfect man. We may also say that He is the man-God. The One whom we worship today is the man-God. Furthermore, to be a man of God, as Moses was (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57913" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:1">Deut. 33:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57914" data-verses="Joshua 14:6">Josh. 14:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57915" data-verses="Psalms 90:1">Psa. 90</span>, title), is to be a God-man, a man who is mingled with God. It is a delight to God that all His chosen and redeemed people would be God-men. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5B77wnH1FzY8BLTY6fCXILA8cHPk2y-0-wcSHFSE7ZmUp0tp06z5YVYlyz-mtu8g6">GOD’S INTENTION TO HAVE A MAN</h2><p data-content-id="NRHnpckJ6kUzVbbOlq4UsvDhVzMs0xCY8-NMDod05m56iu8RUUufdxZWFCU9NFkvw"> God’s intention on earth is to have a man. This is His desire. Eventually, He Himself became a man, and today on the throne He is still a man. People may want to be like God, but God wants to be a man. God’s intention is to work Himself into us, making us the same as He is, and even more, making Himself the same as we are. Thus, God’s intention is to have a man and to work Himself into man. We need to be deeply <span class="pg" data-page-id="125" id="125">[125]</span> impressed with the fact that the Lord is still on the throne as a man. In the book of Ezekiel, the term <em>the son of man</em> is used more than ninety times. This indicates how much God desires to have a man. </p>
<p data-content-id="t8I9sHpJ7S0cz__sqMkC6RW_18KYvi-xEyhSUjmX-nxUewXzrG6j2mAcXlH_K87nH"> If we would live out God and express God, we need to be a man and have the appearance of a man. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57916" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:5">Ezekiel 1:5</span> says that the four living creatures have the appearance of a man, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57917" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:26">verse 26</span> says that the One on the throne has the appearance of a man. The crucial point here is that because man was created in the image of God in order to express God, only man is like God. A person must have the appearance of a man in order to live out the image of God and therefore express God. If we want to live out God and express God, we must be a man and have the appearance of a man. Anyone who does not have the appearance of a man cannot express God. The One on the throne and the four living creatures both have the appearance of a man, indicating that the four living creatures on earth are the expression of the One on the throne. </p>
<p data-content-id="hcD2jLAk2Q_I5adxkIUEYpP7OnIgxfodbVTqRxpuLmJmSrEo35x0gZeqOh4O0u4mK"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57918" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">Chapter one</span> of Ezekiel is the deepest chapter in the Bible. The thought in this chapter is profound. We have seen that the throne is above a clear sky, above a spiritual and heavenly expanse, or firmament. God’s grace works upon a group of people to such an extent that their condition now is the very condition of heaven. In this condition, indicated by a sky that is crystal clear, the throne of God is present. The place of the throne is the place where heaven and earth are connected. Because with the living creatures on earth there is a throne above a clear sky, God is not only the God of heaven but also the God of the earth. Through these living creatures, who have the throne over their heads, heaven and earth are joined. </p>
<p data-content-id="UANm6l8X60Ln81YDphtJfrqCIUVvd6_GJKp7S1vl6365tIU4hsCnLJVxdEpfXhTLP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57919" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">Ezekiel 1</span> the One on the throne is the union of God and man. Thus, the place where the throne is, is the place where heaven and earth are joined. The One on the throne is God, but He manifests the appearance of a man. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was God manifest in the flesh, for He was the God-man and had the appearance of a man. Inwardly, He was God, but His appearance on earth was the appearance of a man. Now, as the One on the throne after His ascension, <span class="pg" data-page-id="126" id="126">[126]</span> He is still the God-man; He is God, yet with the appearance of a man. </p>
<p data-content-id="MrGAKmEwuRJZufnXIFYv373mb87i7bqmm0lYolW9Gtafj5V6y_b9osiAx0Pa2oeqC"> In the church life today, there should be a condition where God is manifested in man. This means that in the church we should have not only a clear sky with a throne and the Lord on the throne but also the expression in man of the One who is on the throne. When this is the condition of the church, there will be in the church the great mystery of godliness—God manifested in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57920" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15-16">1 Tim. 3:15-16</span>). On the one hand, there are a clear sky, a throne, and the Lord on the throne; on the other hand, the Lord’s manifestation in the church is in the appearance of a man. In the church life there should be the manifestation of God in the flesh. In order for this to be the situation, there must be in the church the glorious union of God and man. Inwardly we should have God, but God is manifested in the flesh, manifested in and through a normal and proper humanity. All those in the church life—the brothers and the sisters, the elderly ones and the young ones—should behave in a way that is normal and fitting for their respective ages. Instead of pretense, there should be a genuineness that is both human and divine. This is the condition of God being manifested in humanity. </p>

<p data-content-id="2PYXRuBRbk3pazLkKTlYuB0ijCAv15ApCa1VN8KxIix8cbBt0J74ZrjjS6AX6gZ1X"> As we pointed out in the first message, the book of Ezekiel is of four sections. The first section, consisting of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57951" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">chapter one</span>, presents a vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord. This chapter reveals how God is manifested, how God moves, and how God administrates His government through the coordination of the four living creatures. The second section includes the next thirty-one chapters and covers the judgment of God by fire. In this section we see that God judges His people and the heathen nations by Himself as a consuming fire. The third section (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57952" data-verses="Ezekiel 33:1">chs. 33—39</span>) is concerned with God’s recovery of His people by life. After carrying out His judgment, God comes in to recover. Whereas God’s judgment is by fire, His recovery is by life. The last section (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57953" data-verses="Ezekiel 40:1">chs. 40—48</span>) covers the holy building of God. The issue, the result, of God’s recovery by life is a holy building, which is the consummation of the entire book of Ezekiel. Thus, the four sections of Ezekiel cover four main things: the vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord, the judgment by fire, the recovery by life, and the holy building of God. This is a sketch of the book of Ezekiel, a book that begins with a glorious vision and ends with a holy building. This indicates that God’s goal is the building. </p>
<p data-content-id="uLbh7taL_7-XoK9Q8ONqPzIE4yvJobsJZa-NymaFABQVYF3nbW2_GsMshc2YHU6b6"> We have also seen that the book of Ezekiel and the book of Revelation are similar. Like Ezekiel, Revelation covers the four matters of vision, judgment, recovery, and building, and it covers them in the same sequence that we find in Ezekiel. <span class="pg" data-page-id="138" id="138">[138]</span> The vision of the Lord in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57954" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1</span> is followed by God’s judgment, God’s recovery, and God’s building. Ultimately, the book of Revelation, like the book of Ezekiel, consummates with God’s building with its twelve gates. From this we see that the books of Ezekiel and Revelation are not only similar but are also parallel to each other. The former is on the history of God’s people in the Old Testament; the latter is a revelation of the church in the New Testament. God’s Old Testament people were a foreshadow, a prefigure, a type, of the New Testament church. </p>
<p data-content-id="fLosXWms1KYdGPCBWfcZNVyD3veQ_A9Ht8UGClPEeBQVlDGoJcH_conm1QNn2Q_o4"> If we read Ezekiel carefully, we will realize that it portrays a picture of the church. In a sense, the picture in the Old Testament is more clear and complete than the revelation in the New Testament. Therefore, in reading Ezekiel we should not merely be concerned with the history of Israel or with prophecies regarding Israel, but we should consider the clear picture of the church, in particular the picture unveiled here of the degraded situation of the church. Because the degradation of Israel is a picture of the degradation of Christianity, what we see in this picture is applicable to today’s situation. </p>
<p data-content-id="IX_UvHDiNQNKuMzDpACM7wsR3YWjmOXo9otBId5AM2tk46g0M3mHb3T-Twt1do4v1"> In this message we will begin to consider the second section of Ezekiel—the judgment of God by fire. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57955" data-verses="Ezekiel 2:1">chapters two through twenty-four</span> we see God’s judgment on Israel, His chosen people, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57956" data-verses="Ezekiel 25:1">chapters twenty-five through thirty-two</span>, His judgment on the Gentiles, the nations. God’s judgment is first upon His people, the children of Israel, and then His judgment comes upon the Gentiles. This matches the principle in the New Testament, seen both in the book of Revelation and in 1 Peter, that God first judges His house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57957" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">1 Pet. 4:17</span>) and afterward judges the unbelievers. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Ha_9caqJ-gtW20LDfXmwdUAsc7Hon1Pc0q0siMVKOik-gRx59IRw2r9MVWNDzyftI">THREE STAGES OF THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="JYnuRkNofqaCL_SuH1kddSdsIx_6Xfa3kN3GnclC0uwXkYmOk2tHLkh0JpDrtZKzP"> In the Old Testament Israel was God’s chosen and elect people. God had delivered the people of Israel out of Egypt and had brought them into the good land. God’s putting the people of Israel into the good land typifies God’s putting us into Christ, who is our good land today. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57958" data-verses="Ezekiel 20:6">Ezekiel 20:6</span> says that the good land is the glory of all lands. Christ is the glory on earth, and God has put us into the glorious Christ, who, in <span class="pg" data-page-id="139" id="139">[139]</span> His unsearchable riches, is a land flowing with milk and honey. </p>
<p data-content-id="zqHbu0U7uWGsnviHhDYAXfwirLd65EDd4MObME8uyyFF5Of7TpcGEbbReHiBZe4IV"> The people of Israel experienced three stages of the enjoyment of Christ. In the first stage they enjoyed Christ in Egypt as the Passover with the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs. In the second stage they enjoyed Christ while they were wandering in the wilderness as the heavenly manna and the living water. In the third stage they enjoyed Christ as the land, full of rich produce. </p>
<p data-content-id="aO4fP_PJksfCXqSijn9t0ieBN5TAdwfYZbIFme-3od23Mf0x5MkBQvzpVrexMT24W"> These three stages match our experience today as believers in Christ. When we were saved, we enjoyed Christ as the Passover Lamb. Afterward we began to enjoy Christ as our daily portion, our daily manna. However, this is not the ultimate enjoyment of Christ. The ultimate enjoyment of Christ is to enjoy Christ in the church as the good land with all His unsearchable riches. </p>
<p data-content-id="bdSLpeqsU89fPsdy5AnMsTKy6qVM9m_hi3bf9lycl88fNhg1oeUrZ3wbkkhWUYCI7"> Concerning Christ as the good land, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57959" data-verses="Ezekiel 20:6">Ezekiel 20:6</span> says, “In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.” Milk and honey, both of which are the product of the mingling of the plant life and the animal life, represent the riches of the good land of Canaan. In Christ there are both spiritual food (honey) and spiritual drink (milk). Both milk and honey are the issue of Christ being two kinds of life: the redeeming life, typified by the animal life, which has blood, and the generating, or multiplying, life, typified by the plant, or vegetable, life. On the one hand, the life of the Lord Jesus is a redeeming life—a life which has the blood that was shed for our redemption. On the other hand, the life of the Lord Jesus is a producing and generating life—a life that was released through His death on the cross for His multiplication and increase. These two aspects of His life have been blended to produce milk as our spiritual drink and honey as our spiritual food. Christ is now our milk and honey, and as such He is our supply and enjoyment. If we abide in Him as our good land, we will enjoy the riches of His supply. </p>
<p data-content-id="qwE1WvkY1-QdIiK-pNapO0nzjiA-ugMEQCCUavkTc47dhd_OFD4OTSFvqKJ970JrB"> Eventually, Israel, God’s chosen people, were living in the good land with a temple and a city. The temple signifies God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="140" id="140">[140]</span> house, and the city signifies God’s kingdom. God’s presence is in His house, and God’s authority is in His kingdom. In the church life today, we enjoy Christ as our good land, and therefore we have God’s presence and God’s authority. Because we are God’s elect living in Christ and enjoying all that He is, in the proper and normal church life, we have God’s temple with His presence and God’s kingdom with His authority. </p>

As His elect, they should have been separated from the nations and different from them. The principle is the same with Israel in the Old Testament and with the church in the New Testament. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="_mRKRptREFnggL-PU4CvLSWjQ2XwVg0KRxmxiSAqvoNRoVSn3LxL5lR9p8SgEoUoB">God’s Vine</h2><p data-content-id="BIuz1ZsNpSVEtpe_c5-r0pN6tpq9YkuX1Qe6UHpVubV30a2gTCokxsb0a78hLe8d5"> Israel was not only God’s elect but also God’s vine. God’s vine is for the accomplishing of God’s economy. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57960" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> reveals that Christ is the true vine and that we are the branches. As a whole, Christ and we are a vine for God’s economy. To the vine God grants His rich visitation with the supply of sunshine, air, rain, soil, and many other things that are necessary for the vine to grow and produce something. </p>
<p data-content-id="xpNFS3cnmgvzIaDTu2KkUFYEhiLkbcA-vKEI4I9BgDZLERtmA4_nBIxGCUirLQktl"> This vine consists not only of human beings but of human beings joined to the divine person. This means that the vine is a combination of the Divine Being with many human beings. Such a vine is for God’s economy, and it should produce something that can make God happy and cause people to rejoice. As God’s chosen and elect people, Israel was God’s vine for His economy. Christ with the church is God’s vine today. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qwE1WvkY1-QdIiK-pNapO1Xzkxg-ugMEQCCUavkTc47dhd_OFD4OTSFvqKJ970JrB">THE BASIS OF GOD’S JUDGMENT</h2><p data-content-id="yOtH1HV3kPzgY3hZDsHMPLAelPGklV8y--_Y9J7-0p3T-YCB3UCimInlfqgVbKpbr"> First, we need to see the basis of God’s judgment upon His people. God’s judgment upon His people was based on three things: the righteousness of God, the holiness of God, and the glory of God. In the first section of Ezekiel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58018" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">ch. 1</span>), in the vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord, we saw three main things: the throne, which looked like a sapphire, signifying God’s righteousness; the fire, signifying God’s holiness; and the glowing electrum, signifying God’s glory. As we have pointed out, these three things give us three basic colors. The throne in the appearance of sapphire was blue; the fire was red; and the glowing electrum was yellow. When these three basic colors shine, reflect, and refract together, they give the appearance of the rainbow. The crucial matter here is that God’s righteousness, holiness, and glory are the basis upon which God exercises His judgment over His people. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="8rxS5dZWVru-86TEaA6zN7pjEoLANmg5-TyvgQviBBdA2QzpLMdh_9X48Yc1XaXBM">God’s Glory versus Idols</h2><p data-content-id="0mK3LkhfG47nUOjE9-zWs8IwFZU0lXbjvbrleLxaYyGQ2fu_UAK3zSTJrVOIAjqAC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58019" data-verses="Ezekiel 2:1">chapters two through twenty-four</span> there are some negative things which are versus the righteousness, holiness, and glory of God. God’s glory is versus idols, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58020" data-verses="Ezekiel 8:2-4">8:2-4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58021" data-verses="Ezekiel 8:10">10</span> and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58022" data-verses="Ezekiel 9:3">9:3</span> God’s glory is contrasted with idols. In a vision Ezekiel was brought to Jerusalem and entered the temple. Before Him the glory of God and the idols were contrasted. On the <span class="pg" data-page-id="152" id="152">[152]</span> walls were the images of the idols, and over the temple was the glory of the Lord. The glory of the Lord could not tolerate the images of the idols. Those images were called <em>provoking</em> images because they provoked God’s jealousy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58023" data-verses="Ezekiel 8:3">8:3</span>). Our God is a jealous God; He will not tolerate idols. Because of the idols in the temple, the glory of God withdrew step by step, leaving the temple, the city, and the people. In the last step the glory of the Lord left the temple and the city, stopping on the Mount of Olives on the east side of the city (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58024" data-verses="Ezekiel 11:23">11:23</span>), the same place where the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens. The glory of the Lord stopped there and waited for a while, but eventually it left that mountain and went back to the heavens. That was the departure of the glory of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="iqHzuS4OBJEFR4n8TR2Jizy_SReyBxosrRqyPHAnj_rhfYAb5wc9op72svQD0kj0j"> God’s judgment upon His people is based first upon His glory. Anything that is versus God’s glory will surely provoke His judgment. Today’s Christianity is under God’s judgment. The situation of today’s Christianity is provoking God’s jealousy because of the many idols. The Roman Catholic Church has all kinds of idols, and other so-called churches also have idols. In some of these places there may not be physical idols, but there are other kinds of idols. With some their work for God is an idol. With others Bible teaching or evangelism becomes an idol. If we love our work, activity, or practice more than the Lord, even such things, which are for the Lord, may be idols. Based upon this principle, we can realize that the situation of Christianity is filled with idols. This is why I say that the situation of today’s Christianity is provoking to God and under His judgment. </p>

As God’s elect, God’s chosen people, the church should be pure gold, pure silver, and a pure treasure. However, like the people of Israel at Ezekiel’s time, the church has become dross. Therefore, like Israel the church needs to be burned by fire. The Lord said that He would put the city of Jerusalem and the people of Israel into a furnace to burn them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58025" data-verses="Ezekiel 22:17-22">22:17-22</span>). This indicates that God’s holiness is versus dross. God’s holiness cannot tolerate any kind of dross. <span class="pg" data-page-id="153" id="153">[153]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="jclG18nLWkHIJs8mAdEhaFxInlnctFrdNhIpmn7itG20nB0Co0rExkOSleSpjIvW_"> Consider the situation of today’s Christianity. Where can you find a pure treasure to God? Nearly everywhere you look there is only dross. Surely there is the need of God’s burning fire to burn out the dross. </p>
<p data-content-id="TnPiuEpy87hQJz8U3MuAogME5Z8jxOnarHGWQvC9iBsDYVqVbp5NKVgBsK6amROCx"> The love expressed by many Christians today is not pure but is dross because it is according to the flesh. These ones may love others, but their love is according to the natural human emotion and contains a great deal of mixture or impurity. This kind of love is a love that has not passed through the cross. The same is true of the kindness and humility expressed by many Christians. In this kind of love, kindness, and humility there is no pure gold. Instead of something pure and holy, there is mixture, dross. Those who express such love, kindness, and humility are in the flesh, doing good things or expressing something in a good way. Although the expression may be good, it is still the flesh. There is no dealing of the cross and no dealing of God’s holiness. Therefore, this kind of love, kindness, and humility needs to be burned and judged; it needs to be put under God’s judgment by fire. From this we see that not only does our hatred need to be burned, but even our love needs to be burned. Likewise, both our pride and our humility need to be burned by God. </p>

Ezekiel says clearly some were killed by the sword. <span class="pg" data-page-id="154" id="154">[154]</span> The escapees died from the lack of food; others were killed by pestilence; and the remainder were devoured by beasts. War causes famine. Thus, when there is war, there is a shortage of food. The lack of food brings in pestilence or disease. These are the means God used to exercise His judgment on His people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58028" data-verses="Ezekiel 7:15-17">7:15-17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="L2WIjxRxjPexB4ljS1Z996RkzEqqDMsdmNq-kfPc-ASSG92jR6I00KWKAAuB8m_gB"> These four means of God’s judgment can be applied to the situation of today’s Christianity. Among Christians there is much fighting and very little peace. If in a particular church there is war, this indicates that God’s judgment has come. It indicates that something idolatrous, unholy, or unrighteous has brought in God’s judgment, which is first by the sword, that is, by fighting. We all need to be careful. If there is fighting or dissenting among us, that is a sign of God’s judgment. The more we fight with one another, the more we will suffer God’s judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="mGlXzQXS93cQ2872KI0vyuCcjciV-G1UsJYVrLVxuEDM8b9zGL6DI--iW39DhFc3_"> Due to the fighting among Christians, there is the shortage of food. When a church is filled with fighting, there will not be in such a church a rich supply of spiritual food. Instead of spiritual food, there will be dearth, famine. There will be no supply, no riches of Christ, no living word, and no healthy word. If we desire to have the healthy word, the supply of Christ, and the rich and special spiritual food, we need oneness, peace, and harmony. There is the need for everyone to be in the Spirit and to be one. Such a church is always full of the food supply. After every meeting, there is an abundance of “leftovers.” This is a strong proof that those in this church are not under God’s judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZcpsnUdxuzP1fe7xzQYBQVayi2sby-sPo0PWrAq-u0JTohcoak0pVDSWjfxazgK4B"> Because of the shortage of spiritual food, there is pestilence among Christians today. This means that there are all kinds of spiritual disease, sickness, and weakness. However, when the church life is proper, there will be no pestilence, no disease. Rather, there will be healing, strengthening, and building up. </p>
<p data-content-id="As5RuqkUNs_QiZFPbIMPLbWsKWWjaGSkxZFJj9qFrh1olgghfpp9B3mssRvvCbg_p"> Furthermore, among Christians today there are many roaring, devouring, and ravening beasts. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58029" data-verses="Acts 20:29">Acts 20:29</span> Paul warned the elders from Ephesus that one day wolves would come into the church who would have no pity on the flock. Caring only for themselves, they would devour the church. It <span class="pg" data-page-id="155" id="155">[155]</span> may be that there are small wolves in some of the local churches. </p>
<p data-content-id="FIwJ3qsV0mAwigCPE19nGlFAgxBxca5caBJgl1SwOL2Bj2VbKIKDuM59RyUdUoB__"> Today’s Christianity is characterized by fighting, by the shortage of food, by spiritual diseases, and by roaring, devouring beasts.

This is covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58070" data-verses="Ezekiel 25:1">chapters twenty-five through thirty-two</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Qd35Oici55jXFQ4TZ0gj6np2Ru-ACboj_XWOxcttDFSmUnID-mvJb4Zav1g9e0C6A">ISRAEL BEING THE CENTER OF GOD’S ECONOMY AMONG THE HUMAN RACE ON EARTH</h2><p data-content-id="KoVbp6lsJDUeqDS2edMNt_ZPKQyLEUJGTddYMb8btjSk16Qd0kAVfs-qPqF9MAp6E"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58071" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">Genesis 11</span> rebellious mankind sought to do something to build the tower and city of Babel in order to concentrate themselves and make a name for themselves. However, the Lord came down to exercise His judgment over these rebellious people. Under the Lord’s judgment, Babel became a center not for gathering but for scattering, and the human race was scattered from Babel as the center. </p>
<p data-content-id="l9G_FRwnnsPJj3AhWzxE-FJyJMLiGMotQr6dTzF_0AH1ohdNbcgm_L7axAmUn1xY6"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58072" data-verses="Deuteronomy 32:8">Deuteronomy 32:8</span> says, “When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, / when he separated the sons of Adam, / he set the bounds of the people / according to the number of the children of Israel.” Here we see that God set up the boundaries of all the nations according to the number of the people of Israel. This indicates that in His economy on earth among the human race, God made Israel the center. Israel is the center of the earth’s population. To be sure, God did this with a purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="Og7UyqSl0aJ0cDVx9zF6AEAU-RUmqh4EuqGPEZPgJGx22PnoJnULS4DqVm50PXQyB"> If we look at a map, we will see that Palestine, the good land where God put Israel, is the real center of the inhabited earth. Palestine is situated at the center of the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, the continents where the human race began. Later, the human population spread to America and also to Australia. The central location of the land of Israel provided a good opportunity for the spreading <span class="pg" data-page-id="164" id="164">[164]</span> of the gospel. We know from history that the preaching of the gospel began in Jerusalem and then spread to Europe, Egypt, and Asia. Eventually, the preaching of the gospel spread to America and Australia. This was God’s purpose in putting His people at the center of the human population. Furthermore, according to the prophecy concerning the coming age, the millennium, the people of Israel will be the priests on this earth teaching all the nations to worship God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58073" data-verses="Isaiah 61:6">Isa. 61:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58074" data-verses="Isaiah 2:3">2:3</span>). These prophecies also show us that Palestine is the center of the earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="7dtg_xWd_1oVROwVwjxL40jd8unBvmuWOR1SM6eDsY7qUofk88XbvGJSfbzR4yZMY"> However, at the time of Ezekiel, the people of Israel became degraded and unsuitable for God’s purpose. Their degraded situation forced God to exercise His judgment upon them and temporarily to give up Palestine as His center. God turned to Babel again and raised up King Nebuchadnezzar, who built the great empire of Babylon. The Babylonian empire then became God’s center for executing His judgment. Through the empire of Babylon under King Nebuchadnezzar, God executed His judgment not only upon His people Israel but also over the nations. </p>

Actually, there were more nations around Israel, but the record mentions only seven. This is similar to the mentioning of the seven churches in Asia in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58076" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1—3</span>. When the Lord spoke of the churches in Asia, He selected seven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58077" data-verses="Revelation 1:11">1:11</span>). This does not mean that there were only seven churches in Asia but that the Lord selected seven representative churches. The principle is the same in the book of Ezekiel. There were more than seven nations surrounding Israel, but the Lord selected seven nations as representatives of all the nations. These seven nations were Ammon, Moab, Edom, Philistia, Tyrus, Zidon, and Egypt. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="xpNFS3cnmgvzIaDTu2KkUE4EiirkbcA-vKEI4I9BgDZLERtmA4_nBIxGCUirLQktl">Divided into Three Groups</h2><p data-content-id="rZN_01ZRAZsGzinFwLFI8GrbgTAk6hy_uYn-1RTJR1luDvjvzFq4qNaKHBKyV5NFD"> These seven nations are divided into three groups. The first four nations—Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Philistia—form <span class="pg" data-page-id="165" id="165">[165]</span> the first group; Tyrus and Zidon make up the second group; and Egypt stands alone. We know that these nations are divided into these three groups because Ezekiel saw three separate visions at three different times concerning these groups. His first vision covers the first four nations; his second vision, Tyrus and Zidon; and his third vision, Egypt. Moreover, the first two, Ammon and Moab, fit together as a pair; the third and fourth, Edom and Philistia, stand as a pair; and the fifth and sixth, Tyrus and Zidon, are a pair. Only Egypt is alone. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="d4dzE-7ip2KH-msJg1h1HL2HGpowj1cY4NugEh16_n8sHykLV7fOjxuCtjBE2lIwE">Applicable to Today’s Situation</h2><p data-content-id="Qd35Oici55jXFQ4TZ0gj6np2W9-ACboj_XWOxcttDFSmUnID-mvJb4Zav1g9e0C6A"> The Old Testament is not only a record of history but a record that can be applied to the church today. We need to keep this in mind as we read the book of Ezekiel and be impressed with the fact that Ezekiel was not written merely for the sake of history. Rather, the record in this book is applicable to today’s situation. Therefore, we need to know the spiritual application of all these seven representative nations. Previously we pointed out that the spiritual application of the noisome beasts is that some evil people could be in the church as wolves (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58078" data-verses="Ezekiel 14:21">Ezek. 14:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58079" data-verses="Acts 20:29">Acts 20:29</span>). Here we have the spiritual application of Ezekiel’s word concerning the beasts. Now we need to see the spiritual application of the seven nations. Otherwise, we may read these chapters merely as prophecies which have been fulfilled in history. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KoVbp6lsJDUeqDS2edMNt_ZPMDiLEUJGTddYMb8btjSk16Qd0kAVfs-qPqF9MAp6E">AMMON AND MOAB</h2><p data-content-id="l9G_FRwnnsPJj3AhWzxE-FJyAcriGMotQr6dTzF_0AH1ohdNbcgm_L7axAmUn1xY6"> Ammon and Moab were brothers who were born of Lot by his daughters. Their origin was an ugly, evil thing. Yet Lot was a relative of Abraham, the first forefather of the people of Israel. Hence, in blood Ammon and Moab were somewhat close to Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="Og7UyqSl0aJ0cDVx9zF6AEAU2Bkmqh4EuqGPEZPgJGx22PnoJnULS4DqVm50PXQyB"> According to the record in Ezekiel, Ammon offended God. First, when the sanctuary of God was profaned, they were happy and said, “Aha” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58080" data-verses="Ezekiel 25:2-3">25:2-3</span>). Second, when the holy land of God was made desolate, the Ammonites were also happy. Furthermore, when the house of Judah was carried away into captivity, the Ammonites again were happy. They were happy <span class="pg" data-page-id="166" id="166">[166]</span> about three things: the sanctuary being profaned, the good land being made desolate, and the house of Judah being carried away. This indicates that they hated the sanctuary, the holy land, and the house of Judah. </p>
<p data-content-id="4DeMWmLxu4b-lDGo37i230rTja1zWN4EnLwWFLSDvmDsqxMC4sc0dt6rBw6Gtfsyn"> The sanctuary was a type of the incarnated Christ tabernacling on earth as God’s dwelling place, God’s sanctuary (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58081" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>). The good land also signifies Christ with all His riches and grace that God has given us. According to typology the house of Judah signifies the church. Thus, the sanctuary signifies Christ, the good land signifies all of God’s rich grace in Christ, and the house of Judah signifies the church. Today’s Ammonites hate these three things. They hate Christ, they hate the grace of God in Christ, and they hate the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="ofbGyEjAxjN2AROrgUyqtP7UAQe-wpexrdoqYKmUhns76yxJ-WKrBWbHDNs8KMasj"> During the first centuries A.D. the Roman Empire was a kind of Ammonite. The Roman Empire hated the incarnated Christ, the tabernacle as God’s sanctuary on earth, and it hated the rich grace given by God to His people. The Roman Empire also hated the church. There are still “Ammonites” on earth today, people who hate Christ, God’s grace, and the church. In this country and even in your neighborhood, there are some “Ammonites.” </p>
<p data-content-id="3ADnnUCyZIFQmColjSiiNZ1qsUIqq531s45-fiZptKzEeli67cXRD129xg1t3yvLL"> The Moabites said, “Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58082" data-verses="Ezekiel 25:8">Ezek. 25:8</span>). The Moabites were happy to see that Jerusalem was no longer separated from the nations. This signifies the kind of person who likes to bring the church into an association with the world and who likes to make the church the same as the nations. During the first two centuries of the church, the Roman Empire was an “Ammonite,” hating Christ, God’s grace, and the church. Then a Roman emperor, Constantine, came in not as an “Ammonite” but as a “Moabite.” He brought the church into the world, making the church nearly the same as the nations. </p>
<p data-content-id="G8YLfHFDiG7w35WoxHmRrhuA25lpWf0ygLEo09AQnh7gt7KesIFcUM0gixTROzO2D"> Today the situation is still the same. Some “Ammonites” hate the church, but some “Moabites” have come into the church and have tried to cause the church to be associated with the world and to make the church the same as the world. </p>
<p data-content-id="cfNKR6_Ikj5gcAUgF2D1GsTH7iIhISr-RTlqIDpKhpHf6bnYGXOfPNwozn6omLk5q"> Although Ammon and Moab were brothers, what they did toward the people of Israel was very different. Today we still <span class="pg" data-page-id="167" id="167">[167]</span> have these two kinds of people. I am concerned that in some of the local churches certain ones might be used by Satan to be “Moabites” to bring the church back to the world and to cause the church to be associated with the world. They want the church to be the same as the world, the same as the heathen. </p>

<p data-content-id="EozqjcK3WHH7oN8cuyeAL7JZUvAbTidaE9HxDWd_xQtr_HoZoj_xVW3P53sr-ZAZx"> The dates of Ezekiel’s visions are significant. For instance, the vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58100" data-verses="Ezekiel 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span> concerning Tyrus was in the eleventh year, and the vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58101" data-verses="Ezekiel 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span> concerning Egypt was in the tenth year. This indicates that Ezekiel’s record is not according to chronology but according to meaning. He wrote not according to the sequence of history but according to the sequence of meaning. According to spiritual meaning or significance, Tyrus comes before Egypt, although in fact Ezekiel saw the vision concerning Egypt before the vision concerning Tyrus. The record regarding these seven nations is arranged not according to historical events but according to meaning. This is a strong proof that these seven nations have a spiritual significance. </p>
<p data-content-id="Dt4ZXNpkb1rmwOkLQFgJ40wRPCC69GVaCuSbypSfdx1T1kR7gOoqEPDVRFavwwa4V"> The last three nations—Tyrus, Zidon, and Egypt—are mainly related to worldly wealth and natural resources. Tyrus represents worldly riches and wealth, which damage the church life. We may say that we love the church, but if we pursue the wealth and riches of the world, we will become a damage to the church life. We need to look to the Lord that, in His mercy, none of us in the local churches in the Lord’s recovery would care for worldly riches. Instead of caring for the riches of the world, we should prefer to be poor. </p>
<p data-content-id="SdACyeUFvYVZos1f4owDgBwJ5WxTY6Yz4Byr-rS8Ov6KY4c_9XQ5zHiuRMmT8ec4o"> Out of caring for worldly riches comes Zidon as the pricking briers and the grieving thorns, as indicated by the Lord’s parable in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58102" data-verses="Matthew 13:3-23">Matthew 13:3-23</span>. The church is like a farm for producing something (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58103" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">1 Cor. 3:9</span>). Briers and thorns frustrate the <span class="pg" data-page-id="174" id="174">[174]</span> growth of the proper plants on the farm. In the church life none of us should care for the world’s wealth and riches. If we care for riches, we may hinder not only our own growth but also the growth of others. </p>
<p data-content-id="g_0wEyFGf5iHyh2oYzPFVcx0RQSN6PMtnbwSWO8UaSIUu-Mv80Rrfn0O9tErFjOtz"> The last nation, Egypt, is closely related to Tyrus and Zidon and represents the development of natural resources for others to trust in. When the people of God become poor and are short of food, they put their trust in Egypt. But God said that Egypt was a staff made of reeds and was not strong enough to trust in (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58104" data-verses="Ezekiel 29:6-7">Ezek. 29:6-7</span>). If you trust in Egypt, you will hurt yourself. This indicates that natural resources are not trustworthy. Even many worldly people realize this. If you put your trust in natural resources or in the riches that come from the development of natural resources, you will be a damage to the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="sTV0uWaZaR7-etDNprDCKysPFAlH8qHOUJZKsAEyg7zQL_4KVEdzSLh5sv9V5JA-d"> We should not regard this understanding of the spiritual significance of the seven nations as mere knowledge. Rather, we need to apply this understanding to ourselves in the church life. </p>

God’s judgment is always with a purpose, and God never executes His judgment without a purpose. The purpose of God’s judgment is to bring in recovery. He does not exercise judgment apart from His purpose to recover something. </p>
<p data-content-id="mGlXzQXS93cQ2872KI0vyuicgcCV-G1UsJYVrLVxuEDM8b9zGL6DI--iW39DhFc3_"> We need to remember that God’s judgment is based upon His righteousness, His holiness, and His glory. Whenever the condition among His people or in the world does not match His righteousness, holiness, and glory, God will exercise His judgment for the purpose of recovery. God wants to recover His people according to His righteousness, holiness, and glory. As we will see, whereas God’s judgment is by fire, God’s recovery is by life. </p>

The principle is the same in the New Testament, where God sent John the Baptist as a great watchman. When John the Baptist came, he sounded the trumpet of repentance, crying, “Repent!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58107" data-verses="Matthew 3:1-2">Matt. 3:1-2</span>). In principle, Ezekiel voiced the same thing when he urged the people to turn from their evil ways. God did not want them to die; His desire was that they would turn and live. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58108" data-verses="Ezekiel 33:11">Ezekiel 33:11</span> says, “Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?” </p>

After the warning of the watchman, God did not send an angel or another person; He Himself came as the Shepherd. How wonderful! We see this not only in Ezekiel but also in the New Testament. After John the Baptist sounded the trumpet of repentance, the Lord Jesus came in as the Shepherd (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58110" data-verses="Matthew 9:36">Matt. 9:36</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58111" data-verses="Luke 15:1-7">Luke 15:1-7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58112" data-verses="John 10:11">John 10:11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="PV2fNgIGsuE-bUFgF7Z0pOCXo8jTxnhBooHdZuUQ9Das4Je1zEiSHqrsJ0upsJB4U"> In God’s recovery by life, He first sends the watchman to His people to repent, turn, and live, and then He Himself appears as the Shepherd. In our own personal experiences it is exactly the same. First we may hear a warning from the Lord causing us to repent. Then we realize that the Lord Jesus is not only our Savior but also our Shepherd, seeking and searching us out. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="-wKvpHCzaienBNn1FUrecwcWgcWSNwMXmd0XuRQTF8l38jLFug9nKYw9UAgkaYR6g">Searching for His Sheep and Seeking Them Out</h2><p data-content-id="p38LhWt-j07U2iMCnpvTQz9j53qmv3mR3L5H63FoAbrSm3ahMmnisRyTT9j-cFYQW"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58113" data-verses="Ezekiel 34:11">Ezekiel 34:11</span> says, “For thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.” As the Shepherd, the Lord not only seeks but also searches. Because of our fallen condition, we were all buried under many evil things, so we needed God to search for us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58114" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span> we have <span class="pg" data-page-id="176" id="176">[176]</span> both the shepherd (signifying Christ as the Shepherd) seeking the lost sheep and the woman (signifying the Spirit) lighting the lamp and searching within the house for the lost coin. The prodigal son then was drawn home by the searching of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="v8e1FNT-phHR2DucAbCpa13sb-_K-HGbsUyvlVBbqjrDFw4byAhaNfrI7B0v1zrtp"> The Lord has done the same thing with us. He searched for us in order to save us and recover us. Before we were saved, we were buried under many sins, but the Lord Jesus sought us. Then after we were saved, we backslid into degraded Christianity, and we were buried under many things, such as doctrines, forms, and gifts. However, once again the Lord Jesus searched for us; He sought us out and brought us out. Now we are the ones who have been sought out by the Lord Jesus as the Shepherd. How is it possible for us to be here in the church life? This is not of us but absolutely of Him. We are here because as the Shepherd He sought and searched for us. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="WfEVbagx2vme1BiQhHb5Amo_oz3wiPb1Nstsb4tLT0KnncoTQeDqZVNZPsaUBaDG-">Bringing Them out of the Nations</h2><p data-content-id="2PYXRuBRbk3pazLkKTlYuAkikQQv15ApCa1VN8KxIix8cbBt0J74ZrjjS6AX6gZ1X"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58115" data-verses="Ezekiel 34:12-13">Ezekiel 34:12-13a</span> says, “As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries.” Here we see that Ezekiel prophesied that as the Shepherd the Lord would bring His people, His sheep, out of the nations. </p>
<p data-content-id="uLbh7taL_7-XoK9Q8ONqPyYE8hPJobsJZa-NymaFABQVYF3nbW2_GsMshc2YHU6b6"> This also has been our experience. When we were fallen as sinners or when we became backsliders, we were among the nations living like Gentiles. Although we were living like unbelievers among billions of others on earth, the Lord Jesus sought us out and brought us out of the nations, out of the unbelievers. You might have been a school teacher among many others, but you alone were sought out and brought back by the Lord Jesus, who then caused you to be different from the Gentiles. Formerly you were the same as the unbelievers, but one day the Lord Jesus as the Shepherd sought you and brought you out from among the unbelievers and brought you to Himself. <span class="pg" data-page-id="177" id="177">[177]</span> </p>

This recovery continues in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58157" data-verses="Ezekiel 34:1">chapter thirty-four</span>, where God Himself comes in to be the Shepherd to search for His people, to seek them out, to bring them back, and to cause them to enjoy the riches of Christ signified by the riches of the good land. Following this, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58158" data-verses="Ezekiel 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span> the Lord reminds us of the need to condemn our old man, which is signified by Edom. This is the reason that after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58159" data-verses="Ezekiel 30:1">chapter thirty</span> there is another word concerning the judgment upon Edom. For the most part, God waits until judgment has been executed before He begins His work of recovery. However, in the process of recovery, there is still the need of God’s judgment. This is true, in particular, regarding Edom. Edom was judged in the previous section, but because the old man is very difficult to deal with, the judgment upon the old man must be repeated. Yesterday you might have condemned your old man and experienced judgment upon him. But today your old man may return to pay you a visit, perhaps in a nice way or in a subtle way. You have been recovered and you have been brought back to Christ as the good land and have entered into the rich enjoyment of Christ. You might have thought that your old man had been fully condemned and judged, but you did not realize that he has come back <span class="pg" data-page-id="188" id="188">[188]</span> without giving you any notice and without asking for permission to visit you. Now as you are enjoying Christ, he is with you, hating your enjoyment of Christ and your enjoyment of the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="iqHzuS4OBJEFR4n8TR2JizC_bD-yBxosrRqyPHAnj_rhfYAb5wc9op72svQD0kj0j"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58160" data-verses="Ezekiel 35:1">Ezekiel 35</span> says that Edom and his company were happy to see that Israel was desolate (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58161" data-verses="Ezekiel 35:12">vv. 12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58162" data-verses="Ezekiel 35:15">15</span>). Edom was also waiting to possess the two nations of Israel and Judah, claiming them as belonging to Edom. To the Lord Edom was speaking nonsense, for He intended to exercise His judgment upon Edom once again. </p>
<p data-content-id="1ndPv8fkswHQhtHDIW5BrQuYHReHWyFmZNb9_KLPYegjxTwNUHMra6t8sEFG8knNv"> We need to learn the lesson of judging Edom. While we are being recovered, we have to judge our old man again and again. The judgment upon Ammon, Moab, Tyrus, Zidon, and Egypt may be once for all, but the judgment upon Edom cannot be once for all. On the contrary, Edom, our old man, must be judged repeatedly until the day of the redemption of our body. This is the reason that between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58163" data-verses="Ezekiel 34:1">Ezekiel 34</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58164" data-verses="Ezekiel 36:1">36</span>, which are wonderful chapters, there is a very negative chapter regarding the judgment upon Edom. Because Edom returns, the judgment upon him must be repeated. Although we have condemned him, judged him, and chased him away, he comes back. Therefore, we need to cooperate with the Lord to exercise once again His judgment upon the old man. </p>
<p data-content-id="l9G_FRwnnsPJj3AhWzxE-FpyAeriGMotQr6dTzF_0AH1ohdNbcgm_L7axAmUn1xY6"> The genuine recovery of the Lord is not simply a matter of repenting, turning to the Lord, and enjoying the blessing of the Lord. There also needs to be a change in our life and nature. In His recovery, God needs to touch our heart and our spirit and thereby touch our life directly and change us in life and nature. Therefore, we need both the outward recovery described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58165" data-verses="Ezekiel 34:1">Ezekiel 34</span> and the inward recovery described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58166" data-verses="Ezekiel 36:1">Ezekiel 36</span>. Because the recovery in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58167" data-verses="Ezekiel 36:1">Ezekiel 36</span> concerns our life and our nature and involves our heart and our spirit, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58168" data-verses="Ezekiel 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span> is inserted to show the importance of judging our old man. In order to recover us and make us a new man, God must judge our old man, our old creation. </p>

Whenever we backslide and become fallen, we lose the rich enjoyment of Christ. Christ Himself is rich, but we may lose the enjoyment of His riches. We praise the Lord that in His recovery there is the restoration of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. </p>

Suppose that you have fallen away from Christ, from the church life, and from the fellowship with the saints and have become involved with sinful, worldly things. But one day the Lord seeks you out and brings you back to Himself, to the church life, and to the fellowship with the saints. This is a recovery, but it is only an outward recovery, the outward aspect of the Lord’s recovery. However, at the same time the Lord does an inward work. He not only brings you back to the good land, but He also recovers you inwardly. To be recovered back to the church life and to the fellowship with Christ is only the outward aspect. You still need the inward aspect of the Lord’s recovery, which is covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58172" data-verses="Ezekiel 36:22-30">36:22-30</span>. </p>

Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went. And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, saith the Lord God, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.” Here we see that in recovering His people, God acts on behalf of His holy name. The inward recovery of life is carried out by God for the sake of His name. Many of us can testify that we have been recovered and revived not because of any merit in ourselves but because God did something in us for His own name. <span class="pg" data-page-id="190" id="190">[190]</span> </p>

Filthiness includes all kinds of sinful things, unjust things, unrighteous things, and dark things. It also includes hating others, doing wrong to others, and indulging in worldly amusements. When we were saved, we felt ashamed of these filthy things. When we are revived, we also have such a feeling of shame, not wanting to recall the sinful and worldly things that we were once involved with. The Lord’s blood as the clean water washes us from all our filthiness. Perhaps today we need to be washed from gossip, rumors, jealousy, criticism, and unkindness. We praise the Lord that no matter how filthy we were, the Lord’s blood is the clean water that washes us and cleanses us. </p>

<p data-content-id="Rrf22uMBNQan9P4T7jHi2YXH6YTQyypij84f2YwjWmMEgM7jEdvf-sug8okDcYg7H"> The book of Ezekiel has four main sections, each of which contains one crucial point. The first section, consisting of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58200" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">chapter one</span>, speaks of the glorious vision of God and reveals the holy God in His glory. The second section, composed of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58201" data-verses="Ezekiel 2:1">chapters two through thirty-two</span>, speaks of God’s judgment to deal with all things and matters that do not match His righteousness, holiness, and glory. God judges everything among Israel and among the Gentiles that is incompatible with His nature. The third section, which includes <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58202" data-verses="Ezekiel 33:1">chapters thirty-three through thirty-nine</span>, concerns God’s recovery of a remnant of His people. When God comes in to judge, He remembers His covenant of grace, and thus He preserves a group of His elect and brings them back to their own land. This indicates that the main idea in the third section of Ezekiel is the Lord’s recovery. The fourth section, consisting of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58203" data-verses="Ezekiel 40:1">chapters forty through forty-eight</span>, speaks about God coming to build His beloved recovered people into His dwelling place. This means that the last section is devoted to the matter of God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="sTV0uWaZaR7-etDNprDCKxMPCSFH8qHOUJZKsAEyg7zQL_4KVEdzSLh5sv9V5JA-d"> In the book of Ezekiel, there are three chapters which may be considered great chapters in the Bible—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58204" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">chapter one</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58205" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58206" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:1">chapter forty-seven</span>. These chapters occupy a special position not only in Ezekiel but in the Bible as a whole. Each of these chapters may be represented by a single word: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58207" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">chapter one</span>—<em>fire;</em> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58208" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span>—<em>breath;</em> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58209" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:1">chapter forty-seven</span>—<em>water.</em> No chapter speaks of God as fire in the way <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58210" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">Ezekiel 1</span> does. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58211" data-verses="John 4:1">John 4</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58212" data-verses="John 7:1">7</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58213" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span> speak about water, but not in the way that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58214" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:1">Ezekiel 47</span> does. Likewise, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58215" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:1">Ezekiel 37</span> is unique in the way it speaks of God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="200" id="200">[200]</span> breath. This chapter reveals how God’s Spirit comes into us in order to enliven us that we may become a corporate body, formed into an army, and also built up as God’s dwelling place. Only in this chapter do we see the result of our being enlivened by the breath of life. From this we see that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58216" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:1">Ezekiel 37</span> occupies a particular position in the Bible. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58219" data-verses="Ezekiel 36:1">chapter thirty-six</span> we see that the Lord recovers His people by life not only outwardly but also inwardly, by giving them a new heart and a new spirit and by putting His Spirit within them. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58220" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:1">Chapter thirty-seven</span> reveals that the Lord comes to revive His dead and scattered people and to make them one. From this we see that God’s captured people needed to be recovered in different aspects. Because they had been driven away and scattered like sheep, they needed the Lord to search for them as their Shepherd. Because their inward condition was unclean and old, they needed a new heart and a new spirit. Because they had become dead, dry bones, they needed to be enlivened and joined together. </p>

The plant of renown, a famous plant, is Christ. Christ is not only the good land, containing many trees whose fruits are good for food; Christ is also a plant of renown. Concerning the expression <em>like the garden of Eden,</em> we need to see that eventually the Lord’s recovery should come to the point where it is like the garden of Eden. Then wherever we may be in the Lord’s recovery, we will be in the garden of Eden. Frequently in the meetings of the local churches we have the sense that we are in the garden of Eden. In the garden of Eden we have Christ as a famous plant, the plant of renown. This means that in the church life we enjoy the riches of Christ in a special way day by day. <span class="pg" data-page-id="201" id="201">[201]</span> </p>

In this chapter God comes as the Shepherd to search and seek for His people and to bring them back to His good land. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58225" data-verses="Ezekiel 36:1">Ezekiel 36</span> covers the inward aspect of the Lord’s recovery. In His recovery, the Lord not only brings us back outwardly, but He also inwardly gives us a new heart and a new spirit and puts His Spirit into our spirit. If we see this, we will realize that the Lord’s recovery is not merely a matter of outward position and outward circumstances but also a matter of inward nature and disposition. In the Lord’s recovery, which is something both outward and inward, not only are our position, circumstances, and surroundings changed, but we also have the inward renewing of our heart and our spirit, and we receive the Spirit of God. Outwardly there is a change, and inwardly there is a conversion. </p>
<p data-content-id="p38LhWt-j07U2iMCnpvTQwdj63Kmv3mR3L5H63FoAbrSm3ahMmnisRyTT9j-cFYQW"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58226" data-verses="Ezekiel 36:1">Ezekiel 36</span>, however, does not tell us clearly and thoroughly how we may have a conversion, how we may have a new heart and a new spirit, and how we may obtain God’s Spirit. We are simply told in a general way that the Lord will give us a new heart and a new spirit and put His own Spirit within us. Thus, we need <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58227" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:1">Ezekiel 37</span> to show us how God renews us and regenerates us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="v8e1FNT-phHR2DucAbCpa2XsY-fK-HGbsUyvlVBbqjrDFw4byAhaNfrI7B0v1zrtp">BEING DEAD AND DRY BONES</h2><p data-content-id="WfEVbagx2vme1BiQhHb5AlI_ryXwiPb1Nstsb4tLT0KnncoTQeDqZVNZPsaUBaDG-"> Before God came in to renew us and regenerate us, we were like dead and dry bones. If we had only <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58228" data-verses="Ezekiel 36:1">Ezekiel 36</span>, we would realize that we were sinful and filthy, but we would not think that we were dead. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58229" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:1">Ezekiel 37</span> reveals that we were not only dead but that we were also dry bones. This indicates that God’s salvation is not only for those who are sinful but also for those who are dead. </p>
<p data-content-id="2PYXRuBRbk3pazLkKTlYuDEinRwv15ApCa1VN8KxIix8cbBt0J74ZrjjS6AX6gZ1X"> In the sight of God, when we were fallen, either as a sinner or as a backslidden believer, we were dead and buried in a grave. We were in the “grave” of various sinful things and worldly entertainments. Before we were saved or before we were revived we were all buried in some kind of grave. We were sinful, dead, buried, and dried up. We had no blood, no flesh, <span class="pg" data-page-id="202" id="202">[202]</span> no sinew, no skin—just dry bones. This is a picture showing what we were and where we were. </p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58230" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:1">Ezekiel 37</span> not one piece of bone was joined to another piece. All the bones were disjointed and scattered, having no oneness. Whether we were an unsaved sinner or a backslidden believer, this was our situation. </p>
<p data-content-id="IX_UvHDiNQNKuMzDpACM7ycR-I2jmOXo9otBId5AM2tk46g0M3mHb3T-Twt1do4v1"> Today many Christians are buried in the graves of denominations, divisions, independent groups, and different movements. All denominations, sects, groups, and movements are graves. Many of us can testify that formerly we were in such graves, dead, dry, scattered, disjointed, and not connected to anyone. </p>

Some saints have become fallen and desolate and now are bound in their graves. I do not know by what you were slain or in what kind of grave you are being held. But I hope that God’s wind will blow upon you, that God’s light will shine into you, and that God’s life will work within you to tear open your grave and cause you to come up out of this grave and to be revived. </p>

<p data-content-id="-wKvpHCzaienBNn1FUreczsWkMmSNwMXmd0XuRQTF8l38jLFug9nKYw9UAgkaYR6g"> In the foregoing messages we saw the appearance of the glory of the Lord, the judgment of God by fire, and the recovery of the Lord by life. Now we come to the last section of Ezekiel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58254" data-verses="Ezekiel 40:1">chs. 40—48</span>), which is concerned with the holy building of God. The three previous sections are for the last section; that is, the glory of the Lord, the judgment of God, and the recovery of the Lord are all for the holy building of God. We may even say that the issue of the glory of the Lord, the judgment of God, and the recovery of the Lord is the building of God. God’s eternal purpose is to have a building. Whatever God does among His people on earth is for His building. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="p38LhWt-j07U2iMCnpvTQwNj9lKmv3mR3L5H63FoAbrSm3ahMmnisRyTT9j-cFYQW">THE TIME OF THE VISION</h2><p data-content-id="v8e1FNT-phHR2DucAbCpa2HsesPK-HGbsUyvlVBbqjrDFw4byAhaNfrI7B0v1zrtp"> At the very beginning of this section (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58255" data-verses="Ezekiel 40:1">40:1</span>), we are told the time of the vision—the year, the month, and the day. If we compare the year mentioned here with that mentioned at the beginning of the first chapter, we will see that there is a difference of twenty years. The vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord which Ezekiel saw in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58256" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">chapter one</span> was seen in the fifth year of the captivity. The vision of the building of God’s house which he saw in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58257" data-verses="Ezekiel 40:1">chapter forty</span> was in the twenty-fifth year of the captivity. There is a difference of twenty years, which is not a short time. We need to remember that when Ezekiel saw the first vision, he was thirty years of age, the age at which a priest began to function. When he saw the last vision, he was fifty years of age, the age of retirement for a priest. This is very meaningful, for it indicates that to see the building of God, Ezekiel needed more maturity in life. When he saw the first vision, he was still rather young, only thirty <span class="pg" data-page-id="210" id="210">[210]</span> years of age. But when he saw the vision of God’s building, he was at the age of retirement, indicating that he attained further maturity in life and could see the building of the Lord. To see the vision of God’s building, maturity in life is required. Due to their immaturity in the divine life, very few of today’s Christians have seen anything regarding the Lord’s building. Spiritually speaking, many are far below the age of thirty and thus are not even qualified to be an apprentice. Thus, it is not possible for them to see the vision of God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="WfEVbagx2vme1BiQhHb5AlY_ih3wiPb1Nstsb4tLT0KnncoTQeDqZVNZPsaUBaDG-"> It is significant that the years are counted in increments of five. The first vision was seen in the fifth year, and the last vision was seen in the twenty-fifth year. </p>
<p data-content-id="2PYXRuBRbk3pazLkKTlYuDUivCAv15ApCa1VN8KxIix8cbBt0J74ZrjjS6AX6gZ1X"> Twenty-five is five times five. In the Bible the number five signifies man plus God. Four is the number of the creature, man, and one is the number for the Creator, God. Five signifies the bearing of responsibility. Therefore, five, which is composed of four plus one, signifies that man as a creature plus God as the Creator together bear responsibility. The number twenty-five signifies not only maturity but also the full qualification for bearing responsibility. </p>
<p data-content-id="EozqjcK3WHH7oN8cuyeAL45ZT9gbTidaE9HxDWd_xQtr_HoZoj_xVW3P53sr-ZAZx"> This year is also called the fourteenth year. The twenty-fifth year was counted from the time of the captivity, whereas the fourteenth year was counted from the time of the destruction of Jerusalem. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58258" data-verses="Ezekiel 40:1">Ezekiel 40:1</span> says, “After that the city was smitten.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Dt4ZXNpkb1rmwOkLQFgJ43ARJQy69GVaCuSbypSfdx1T1kR7gOoqEPDVRFavwwa4V"> In the Bible the number fourteen is composed mainly of seven times two. Seven is the number of completion, and two is the number of testimony. Therefore, seven times two denotes a testimony of completion. This indicates that for fourteen years the destruction of the city of Jerusalem had been a strong testimony to the people. Originally, the people did not believe that the city would be destroyed. Nevertheless, Ezekiel prophesied concerning the destruction of the city of Jerusalem, and his prophecy was fulfilled. Fourteen years after the destruction of Jerusalem, Ezekiel saw further visions. This means that the testimony of the destruction of the city was sufficient. It stood for fourteen years, and after those fourteen years the people in captivity realized that it was a strong testimony. <span class="pg" data-page-id="211" id="211">[211]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="SdACyeUFvYVZos1f4owDgCAJwExTY6Yz4Byr-rS8Ov6KY4c_9XQ5zHiuRMmT8ec4o"> Furthermore, we are told that Ezekiel saw the visions at the beginning of the year, in the first month. The first month indicates a new start. This indicates that with us in our experience, the building of God must have a new start. When we see something regarding the building up of the church, this is a new start in our life. </p>
<p data-content-id="g_0wEyFGf5iHyh2oYzPFVfB0ZCCN6PMtnbwSWO8UaSIUu-Mv80Rrfn0O9tErFjOtz"> The record speaks also of the tenth day. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58259" data-verses="Exodus 12:3">Exodus 12:3</span> the tenth day of the first month was the day that the people of Israel prepared the lamb for the Passover. This surely points to Christ, our Passover, for our redemption. From this we see that whenever we have a new beginning in our Christian life, it must be based on Christ and His redemption. In ourselves, by what we are and what we can do, we can never have a new beginning. We are not qualified to have a new beginning, and we have no merit to have a new beginning. Any new beginning that we can have in our spiritual life is always based on Christ, the Passover Lamb, and His redemption. Only by Christ and His redemption can we have a new beginning in our Christian life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="eEfMgHWo1dWZ0DidRr1yPS4NJg99xexduNkkPs8a7-zsUc3SyJyc5YfURXamXrJQP">THE PLACE TO SEE THE VISION</h2><p data-content-id="5B77wnH1FzY8BLTY6fCXIJw8cGPk2y-0-wcSHFSE7ZmUp0tp06z5YVYlyz-mtu8g6"> Now we need to consider the place to see the vision. Ezekiel did not see the vision concerning the building of God in the land of captivity. Rather, he was brought back to the holy land, the land of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58260" data-verses="Ezekiel 40:2">Ezek. 40:2</span>). Since this land signifies Christ, to be brought back to the land of Israel is to be brought back to Christ. In addition to being brought back to the land of Israel, Ezekiel was brought to a high mountain, signifying a place of resurrection and ascension. When we come back to Christ, we may sense in our spirit that we are in an elevated place, that is, in the resurrected and ascended Christ. Furthermore, Ezekiel was brought back to Jerusalem. Many of us can testify that while we were in captivity in the denominations, we could not see the vision of the building of the church. But when we came back to the holy land, to the church life, we could see the vision of the building of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="NRHnpckJ6kUzVbbOlq4UstzhVyMs0xCY8-NMDod05m56iu8RUUufdxZWFCU9NFkvw"> In order to see something properly, we need the right position, the right standing, and the right angle. If we are wrong either in position or in standing, we will not be able to see. <span class="pg" data-page-id="212" id="212">[212]</span> For example, if we want to see Los Angeles, we must be in the right position and have the right standing. If we want to see God’s building, we need to be on the mountain in Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="t8I9sHpJ7S0cz__sqMkC6Tm_19KYvi-xEyhSUjmX-nxUewXzrG6j2mAcXlH_K87nH"> Ezekiel was not the only person who saw the vision of God’s building. In the book of Revelation the apostle John told us that he was carried away in spirit to a high mountain to see the holy city, New Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58261" data-verses="Revelation 21:10">21:10</span>). The reason that we need to be on a mountain (which signifies resurrection and ascension) is that the building of God is something in the resurrection and ascension of Christ, and we need to be in an elevated position in order to see the vision of God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="hcD2jLAk2Q_I5adxkIUEYr_7OkIgxfodbVTqRxpuLmJmSrEo35x0gZeqOh4O0u4mK"> Some people have been offended because of my ministering on the building of God. The reason they are offended is that, regarding spiritual matters, they are like little children playing with toys. If you touch their “toys,” they will be offended. If you tell them that they need to grow up in the spiritual life and give up their toys, they may be quite upset. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we may grow up and also go up. We not only need to grow up, but we also need to go up to the highest position with the highest standing and the best angle to see the building of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="UANm6l8X60Ln81YDphtJfpaCIXVvd6_GJKp7S1vl6365tIU4hsCnLJVxdEpfXhTLP"> If Ezekiel had remained in Babylon in the captivity, he could not have seen the building. Likewise, if he had been on a plain and not on the mountaintop, he could not have seen the vision of God’s building. Therefore, if we would see this vision, we need to grow up and to go up. This means that we need maturity in life and that we need to be on the high mountain. Then we will be able to see the building of God. </p>

<p data-content-id="k4Ajjh-9TG5V-Yz5rWAXw53pqGAD6qGu0sspdVg7meIXyXNW5MC3fw76TFIIoEuvx"> In the foregoing message, we covered many of the details related to the gates. They are divided into four sections: the first threshold, a passage, a further threshold, and the porch. Each gate is six cubits high and ten cubits wide. Six is the number of the Lord’s humanity, by which He fulfilled all the requirements of the Ten Commandments. This indicates that the number six fulfills the number ten; that is, the man Jesus fulfills the Ten Commandments. As we have pointed out, the dimensions of the guardrooms match the dimensions of the cross section of the wall—six cubits by six cubits. This indicates that to us the guardrooms are Christ Himself as God mingled with man. The passage, having the number eight, indicates a new beginning in resurrection. The porch, the final section of the gate, has the numbers two, six, and eight, indicating that the Lord as a man is fully in resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="JYnuRkNofqaCL_SuH1kdeStsPjf6Xfa3kN3GnclC0uwXkYmOk2tHLkh0JpDrtZKzP"> All the numbers used in Ezekiel with respect to the building of God are very meaningful. The numbers three, five, and multiples of five are used frequently. For instance, extensive use is made of the number thirty, which signifies the Triune God in resurrection bearing the full responsibility. When Ezekiel saw the visions in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58281" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">chapter one</span>, he was thirty years of age. There are thirty supporting posts, thirty chambers in the outer court, and thirty side chambers surrounding the temple. In Ezekiel the number thirty indicates both maturity which is able to bear something and also the enjoyment and expression of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="zqHbu0U7uWGsnviHhDYAUfAitZt65EDd4MObME8uyyFF5Of7TpcGEbbReHiBZe4IV"> The palm trees on the posts signify victory and everlasting power. Because the columns must bear the weight of the roof and support the entire building, they need to be in victory and <span class="pg" data-page-id="226" id="226">[226]</span> to be everlasting. Christ is the column which supports and bears God’s building with a victorious, everlasting life. </p>
<p data-content-id="aO4fP_PJksfCXqSijn9t3iuBErTAdwfYZbIFme-3od23Mf0x5MkBQvzpVrexMT24W"> We have also seen that the gate has thirty windows to let in light and air. These windows are covered with a lattice, or screen, to keep the negative things out. All this is precisely the work of the life-giving Spirit: He brings in the light and the air, but He continually screens out the negative things. </p>
<p data-content-id="bdSLpeqsU89fPsdy5AnMvT6yy4FM9m_hi3bf9lycl88fNhg1oeUrZ3wbkkhWUYCI7"> In this message we will go on to see that with the temple in Ezekiel there are two courts: the outer court and the inner court. Let us first consider what is in the outer court and then the inner court. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="IX_UvHDiNQNKuMzDpACM4wcR-K2jmOXo9otBId5AM2tk46g0M3mHb3T-Twt1do4v1">THE OUTER COURT</h2><p data-content-id="Ha_9caqJ-gtW20LDfXmweUwsUp3on1Pc0q0siMVKOik-gRx59IRw2r9MVWNDzyftI"> If we would enter into the temple which Ezekiel saw in his vision, we must first climb up the seven steps and then pass through the spacious gate. This would bring us into the outer court of the temple. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="XepL-yKvCOMfBVF1zePEl2_xKNnDxci6eLedCPyLziLypB00oXRDxbo8XzhFKTQ4h">The Pavement</h2><p data-content-id="k4Ajjh-9TG5V-Yz5rWAXw53puUQD6qGu0sspdVg7meIXyXNW5MC3fw76TFIIoEuvx"> The first thing we need to pay attention to in the outer court is the pavement. There is pavement around the wall on the three sides of the outer court, on the east, the south, and the north. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="JYnuRkNofqaCL_SuH1kdeStsIw_6Xfa3kN3GnclC0uwXkYmOk2tHLkh0JpDrtZKzP">The Chambers</h2><p data-content-id="zqHbu0U7uWGsnviHhDYAUfAirKd65EDd4MObME8uyyFF5Of7TpcGEbbReHiBZe4IV"> There are six different sections, or areas, of pavement, and on each section there are five chambers. This means that there are thirty chambers. Here the number thirty is composed of five times six. </p>
<p data-content-id="aO4fP_PJksfCXqSijn9t3iuBN4TAdwfYZbIFme-3od23Mf0x5MkBQvzpVrexMT24W"> In addition to the thirty chambers on the pavement, there are four small courts, one at each corner of the outer court. These four courts at the four corners are places for boiling the sacrifices. In modern terms, these are kitchens, places for cooking food. These cooking places are used not by the priests but by the people. Whereas the priests eat in the inner court, the people eat in the outer court. </p>
<p data-content-id="bdSLpeqsU89fPsdy5AnMvT6y6rVM9m_hi3bf9lycl88fNhg1oeUrZ3wbkkhWUYCI7"> Outside of these kitchens, these cooking places, are some chambers. These chambers are for eating, just as in our homes the room connected to the kitchen is the dining room, a <span class="pg" data-page-id="227" id="227">[227]</span> place for eating the food prepared in the kitchen. In Ezekiel, the chambers connected to the kitchens are dining places for the people to enjoy the sacrifices. This indicates that these chambers are places to enjoy Christ. From this we can see that the main thing in the outer court is the enjoyment of Christ as the offerings and sacrifices. After we pass through the gate, we come to the outer court and enter into the chambers to eat, to enjoy, Christ, who is the reality of all the offerings. </p>
<p data-content-id="qwE1WvkY1-QdIiK-pNapN0XzjhA-ugMEQCCUavkTc47dhd_OFD4OTSFvqKJ970JrB"> Ezekiel tells us that these chambers for eating are built upon the pavement (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58282" data-verses="Ezekiel 40:17">40:17</span>). In ancient times the pavement of a court was made with stones. This indicates that whenever we are about to enjoy Christ, we need to be on a pavement made of stones. The stone pavement separates us from the dirt of the earth. Otherwise, our feet would be on the dirt. As believers in Christ, we have the pavement of the stones to separate us from the dirt. Although we are still on the earth and in the world, we are separated from any kind of dirt. </p>
<p data-content-id="yOtH1HV3kPzgY3hZDsHMMKAejf2klV8y--_Y9J7-0p3T-YCB3UCimInlfqgVbKpbr"> Originally, as the old creation, we were clay, being the same in nature as the earth. We came out of the earth, and we were one with the earth. But when we were saved, converted, and regenerated, we became stones, which are for the pavement. Now if we intend to enjoy Christ, we need to stand upon the stones of our regeneration. </p>
<p data-content-id="8rxS5dZWVru-86TEaA6zO6pjO6rANmg5-TyvgQviBBdA2QzpLMdh_9X48Yc1XaXBM"> However, in their daily situation, many genuine Christians do not stand upon these stones. After work, they may engage in certain worldly activities and entertainments. They are genuine Christians, but they are standing on dirt; they do not have a pavement of stones under their feet. </p>
<p data-content-id="0mK3LkhfG47nUOjE9-zWv9IwOLk0lXbjvbrleLxaYyGQ2fu_UAK3zSTJrVOIAjqAC"> As those in the church life in the Lord’s recovery, our situation should be very different. When we come home after a day at work or at school, we may take a rest or have dinner. Then, exercising our spirit to call on the Lord, we gather together in a meeting to enjoy the Lord. This indicates that we are standing on a pavement of stones. Furthermore, in our experience the pavement on which we are standing becomes a place, a “chamber,” for us to enjoy Christ. Many of us can testify that day by day we are in the chambers enjoying Christ. This is especially true of the Lord’s Day. By contacting the Lord early <span class="pg" data-page-id="228" id="228">[228]</span> in the morning, we put our feet on the stones and prepare ourselves to come into the chambers. Then in the meetings of the church we enjoy Christ by eating Him. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="7dtg_xWd_1oVROwVwjxL71zd_uHBvmuWOR1SM6eDsY7qUofk88XbvGJSfbzR4yZMY">The Number Thirty</h2><p data-content-id="_mRKRptREFnggL-PU4CvISmjT03wVg0KRxmxiSAqvoNRoVSn3LxL5lR9p8SgEoUoB"> The number thirty, used in relation to the chambers, is composed either of five times six or of three times ten. If thirty is composed of five times six, we then have man (six) multiplied by responsibility (five). If thirty is composed of three times ten, then we have the Triune God in resurrection (three) fulfilling all the requirements (ten). The Christ whom we enjoy is the number thirty. He is not merely five or six or three. As the number thirty, He includes six, five, three, and ten. In Him we have man, the Triune God, resurrection, responsibility, and the fulfillment of all the requirements. The number ten also signifies completion and perfection. This indicates that in Christ we have completeness and perfection. Praise the Lord that we have such a rich Christ for our enjoyment! </p>
<p data-content-id="BIuz1ZsNpSVEtpe_c5-r3p96toq9YkuX1Qe6UHpVubV30a2gTCokxsb0a78hLe8d5"> The number thirty here corresponds to the thirty sides of the posts. This indicates that our enjoyment of Christ depends on His being the supporting posts, or pillars. The extent to which He bears, supports, and sustains, is the extent to which we can enjoy Him. Also, the thirty chambers correspond to the thirty windows. If the all-inclusive Spirit were not of the number thirty, we could not have the rich enjoyment of Christ as the number thirty. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="xpNFS3cnmgvzIaDTu2KkXFoEhjLkbcA-vKEI4I9BgDZLERtmA4_nBIxGCUirLQktl">The Width of the Pavement</h2><p data-content-id="rZN_01ZRAZsGzinFwLFI_H7bjTgk6hy_uYn-1RTJR1luDvjvzFq4qNaKHBKyV5NFD"> If we consult the diagram of the plot plan, we will see that the width of the pavement equals the length of the gate. This signifies that the Christ whom we enjoy is the Christ whom we experience. How much we can enjoy Christ depends on how much we experience Christ. If our experience of Christ measures fifty cubits, then our enjoyment of Christ will also measure fifty cubits. How much are we able to enjoy Christ? This depends on how much we experience Christ. The more we pass through Christ, the more we experience Christ, and the more we experience Christ, the more we enjoy <span class="pg" data-page-id="229" id="229">[229]</span> Christ. We cannot enjoy Christ if we have Christ only in doctrine. This means that we cannot enjoy a Christ whom we have not experienced. We can only enjoy the Christ whom we have experienced. The width of our enjoyment of Christ always equals the length of our experience of Christ. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="0mK3LkhfG47nUOjE9-zWv9YwPZU0lXbjvbrleLxaYyGQ2fu_UAK3zSTJrVOIAjqAC">THE ALTAR</h1><p class="scripture" data-content-id="7dtg_xWd_1oVROwVwjxL71jd58HBvmuWOR1SM6eDsY7qUofk88XbvGJSfbzR4yZMY">Scripture Reading: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58287" data-verses="Ezekiel 40:47">Ezek. 40:47</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58288" data-verses="Ezekiel 43:13-17">43:13-17</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="_mRKRptREFnggL-PU4CvIS2jUmnwVg0KRxmxiSAqvoNRoVSn3LxL5lR9p8SgEoUoB"> In this message we will go on from the inner gate and even from the inner court to consider the central matter—the altar. Before we do this, I would like to review two other matters so that we may be impressed with them. </p>
<p data-content-id="BIuz1ZsNpSVEtpe_c5-r3pt6p7K9YkuX1Qe6UHpVubV30a2gTCokxsb0a78hLe8d5"> First, we have seen that altogether there are six gates in three groups of two, on the east, on the south, and on the north. We need to remember that six is the number of man, who was created on the sixth day, and that the number three signifies the Triune God in resurrection. The six gates signify that the Triune God is mingled with man. Three is mingled with six. The fact that the gates are divided into three groups of two indicates that the Triune God became a man, the God-man, and was “split,” or “cut,” in His crucifixion, and is now in resurrection. He is now the gate through which we enter into God and into all the things of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="xpNFS3cnmgvzIaDTu2KkXF4Ekw7kbcA-vKEI4I9BgDZLERtmA4_nBIxGCUirLQktl"> Second, we need to notice that from the outer gate to the inner gate is a distance of exactly one hundred cubits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58289" data-verses="Ezekiel 40:47">40:47</span>). The number one hundred is composed either of ten times ten or of twenty times five. Ten times ten signifies fullness in fullness or completion in completion. Twenty times five signifies full and complete responsibility as a testimony. Furthermore, as the chart on page 215 indicates, there are three sections of one hundred cubits each, making a total of three hundred cubits. Once again, the number three signifies the Triune God, who became a man, the God-man. How wonderful and marvelous it is that we are in such a God-man! <span class="pg" data-page-id="236" id="236">[236]</span> He was crucified, but now He is in resurrection, and we are in Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="rZN_01ZRAZsGzinFwLFI_HrbpAgk6hy_uYn-1RTJR1luDvjvzFq4qNaKHBKyV5NFD">THE ALTAR BEING THE CENTER OF THE COMPOUND</h2><p data-content-id="d4dzE-7ip2KH-msJg1h1EK2HO6Ywj1cY4NugEh16_n8sHykLV7fOjxuCtjBE2lIwE"> If we consult the diagram on page 215 which shows the plot plan of the temple, we will see that no matter which gate we take to enter the compound, eventually we will come to the altar. There is no exception; the altar is unavoidable. We have all come in through the wonderful God-man, who was crucified and who is now in resurrection. If we want to meet God, we must come to the altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="hcD2jLAk2Q_I5adxkIUEbp_7OmIgxfodbVTqRxpuLmJmSrEo35x0gZeqOh4O0u4mK"> The altar is at the center of the compound. The altar is the center not only of the inner court but also of the whole premises of the temple. </p>
<p data-content-id="UANm6l8X60Ln81YDphtJcraCIVVvd6_GJKp7S1vl6365tIU4hsCnLJVxdEpfXhTLP"> This altar, which signifies the cross, is actually the center of the universe. As far as the relationship between man and God is concerned, the earth is the center. The center of the inhabited earth is the good land of Canaan, Palestine, for it is the connecting center that connects the continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The city of Jerusalem is the center of the good land; the temple compound is the center of Jerusalem; and the altar is the center of the temple compound. Thus, ultimately the altar is the center of the universe. Since the altar signifies the cross, this means that the cross is the center of the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="MrGAKmEwuRJZufnXIFYv07Hmb97i7bqmm0lYolW9Gtafj5V6y_b9osiAx0Pa2oeqC"> It is crucial for us to know the full significance of the cross. According to superficial Christian teachings, the cross is the place where the Lord Jesus died for us. This is surely true, but the cross means much more than this. As the center of the universe, the cross signifies the all-inclusive death of God, of man, and of all the creatures. The death of the Lord Jesus on the cross was not the death merely of one single person; it was an all-inclusive death involving God, man, and all the creatures. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VCxrIZDROhzMg_iDUgurcvQm0l5wtZDDUMpTzPLj8wbLbl_0fQ-LNoTLnOG_szDEn">THE MEETING PLACE OF GOD AND MAN</h2><p data-content-id="iqHzuS4OBJEFR4n8TR2Jhyi_SQeyBxosrRqyPHAnj_rhfYAb5wc9op72svQD0kj0j"> As we have pointed out, by looking at the plot plan of the temple compound, we can see that no matter through which gate we enter, we will arrive at the altar. When God comes <span class="pg" data-page-id="237" id="237">[237]</span> from the temple to meet man, He likewise arrives at the altar. Therefore, the altar is not only the center of the universe but also the meeting place of God with man and of man with God. If one person comes in through the north gate and another enters through the south gate, both will eventually meet God and each other at the altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="1ndPv8fkswHQhtHDIW5BoROYPCuHWyFmZNb9_KLPYegjxTwNUHMra6t8sEFG8knNv"> God came out of His dwelling place and went to the cross and died there. First, He left His dwelling place and was born in Bethlehem. After living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, He went to the altar, to the cross. As He was dying there, He was not alone. Through His incarnation He had put man upon Himself. Hence, as He was dying on the cross, man was also dying there. This indicates that God and man met together on the cross in the way of death. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="9ijk45dscac4Wlmzclqwzx7P-6fiy2-Am9tCXkwHT7HfH7cIo2T26IlH4uk-xtqu6">Death Being a Release to God</h2><p data-content-id="jclG18nLWkHIJs8mAdEhZEhInknctFrdNhIpmn7itG20nB0Co0rExkOSleSpjIvW_"> God, however, cannot be affected by death. No matter how much death He passes through, He remains the same. Death actually helps Him to be released. God came out of His dwelling place and went to the cross and died there in order to release what was in Him. We may use a grain of wheat as an illustration. When a grain of wheat is sown into the earth, it dies. Is this death terrible or is it wonderful? We should say that the death of a grain of wheat is wonderful, because without this death all the riches and beautiful things in the grain cannot be released. For this reason, the death of a grain of wheat is not terrible but wonderful. In the same principle, death is wonderful to God. The Lord Jesus said, “Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58290" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>). He was speaking of Himself as the one grain who would fall into the ground and die in order to be multiplied into many grains. By His death the riches of the divine life within Him were released. Because God is life, even resurrection, He cannot be terminated by death. Whatever is of man can be terminated, but whatever is of God is released through death. Now we can see that when God went to the altar, the cross, and died there, His life was released. <span class="pg" data-page-id="238" id="238">[238]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="TnPiuEpy87hQJz8U3MuArhcE5a8jxOnarHGWQvC9iBsDYVqVbp5NKVgBsK6amROCx">Death Being a Termination to Man</h2><p data-content-id="nspAW8ybtAwd-FktD5YN4BBw4dtVLabqi3PMGvjyYxVnV4VwKoIMl0lUt0qaHwvp9"> As we have pointed out, man also was on the cross. When the Lord Jesus died, man also died, and this death meant the termination of man. All the negative things related to man were terminated on the cross. Praise the Lord that we all were terminated on the cross! By the all-inclusive death of the Lord Jesus on the cross, all the riches of God were released. The death of Christ on the cross was a wonderful release to God and a wonderful termination to us. We all need this vision of the altar. We need to see that, no matter what our age may be, we all were terminated on the cross at the same time. The riches of God were released there, and all the negative things were terminated there. Therefore, the all-inclusive death of Christ on the cross was our termination and God’s release. </p>
<p data-content-id="6qZ5AXEp8asjHStkAiRCcT5uQITlXOIcRxYU_wF5J7VdKbK50VwX457J7bPXvUbLm"> The mingling of God with man began when the Lord Jesus was born in Bethlehem. By His incarnation God came into man. But the mingling of man with God began on the cross and was fully accomplished at the resurrection. Through the Lord’s death and resurrection, we were put into God and were mingled with God. Therefore, through incarnation God came into man, and through death and resurrection man was put into God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Rrf22uMBNQan9P4T7jHi1aHH9KjQyypij84f2YwjWmMEgM7jEdvf-sug8okDcYg7H"> All that we are and have was terminated on the cross, on the altar. Through the cross the divine life was released, and then this life was imparted to us through Christ’s resurrection. If we bury a grain of wheat and a small stone, something living will grow out of the grain of wheat, but the stone will remain buried. Through His death on the cross, the Lord Jesus as a grain of wheat was released, but we, a dead “stone,” were terminated. Although we have been terminated in this way, the divine life has been imparted into us to make us wonderful persons. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="Og7UyqSl0aJ0cDVx9zF6DFwU0RUmqh4EuqGPEZPgJGx22PnoJnULS4DqVm50PXQyB">THE TEMPLE AND SIDE CHAMBERS</h1><p class="scripture" data-content-id="4DeMWmLxu4b-lDGo37i201bTlIVzWN4EnLwWFLSDvmDsqxMC4sc0dt6rBw6Gtfsyn">Scripture Reading: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58294" data-verses="Ezekiel 40:48-49">Ezek. 40:48-49</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58295" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:25-26">41:25b-26a</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ofbGyEjAxjN2AROrgUyquOLUHCu-wpexrdoqYKmUhns76yxJ-WKrBWbHDNs8KMasj"> In this message we will consider the temple and the side chambers. The temple is composed of three sections: the porch, the Holy Place (outer temple), and the Most Holy (inner temple). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3ADnnUCyZIFQmColjSiiOYFqoGIqq531s45-fiZptKzEeli67cXRD129xg1t3yvLL">THE TEMPLE</h2><p data-content-id="G8YLfHFDiG7w35WoxHmRogeAzr1pWf0ygLEo09AQnh7gt7KesIFcUM0gixTROzO2D"> After we pass the altar, we come to the temple. The temple is composed of three main sections: the porch, the outer temple, which is called the Holy Place, and the inner temple, which is called the Most Holy or the Holy of Holies. In addition, there is an attachment which Ezekiel calls the side chambers. The side chambers surround the entire building of the temple. Thus, the temple is composed of three sections with an attachment. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="cfNKR6_Ikj5gcAUgF2D1FtjHxxohISr-RTlqIDpKhpHf6bnYGXOfPNwozn6omLk5q">The Porch</h2><p data-content-id="Y6VPJt1oDg8WbmA7biITMyzWSNec88cF2EKdOPvQBDrnx0Sx5TXxBKCVwq3Eo1b_t"> Let us begin with the first main part of the temple, the porch. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="qwE1WvkY1-QdIiK-pNapN03zjjA-ugMEQCCUavkTc47dhd_OFD4OTSFvqKJ970JrB">The Steps</h2><p data-content-id="yOtH1HV3kPzgY3hZDsHMMKgejd2klV8y--_Y9J7-0p3T-YCB3UCimInlfqgVbKpbr"> Ten steps lead up to the porch (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58296" data-verses="Ezekiel 40:49">40:49</span>). Now we can see that the compound of the temple has three levels: the first level in the outer court, the second level in the inner court, and the third level in the temple. The ground floor of the temple is on the third level. We need to remember that the street outside the wall is on a level even lower than that of the outer court. If we count from the street outside of the wall of the compound of the temple, there are four levels, with the street as the first level, the outer court as the second, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="250" id="250">[250]</span> </p>
<p class="image" data-content-id="8rxS5dZWVru-86TEaA6zO6JjN6LANmg5-TyvgQviBBdA2QzpLMdh_9X48Yc1XaXBM"> <img alt="chart" src="https://www.ministrybooks.org/assets/img/charts/LS01-26Ezekiel22_chart.jpg"/> <span class="pg" data-page-id="251" id="251">[251]</span></p>
<p class="noindent" data-content-id="0mK3LkhfG47nUOjE9-zWv9owNLE0lXbjvbrleLxaYyGQ2fu_UAK3zSTJrVOIAjqAC"> inner court as the third, and the ground floor of the temple as the fourth. This gives us some idea of the elevation of the temple. </p>
<p data-content-id="7dtg_xWd_1oVROwVwjxL71Td8vnBvmuWOR1SM6eDsY7qUofk88XbvGJSfbzR4yZMY"> It also indicates that the further inward we proceed in the temple, the higher we rise. When we are outside the wall, we are on the lowest level. But when we enter and progress inward, we rise higher and higher. When we go from the street to the outer court, we must ascend seven steps higher. When we go from the outer court to the inner court, we must ascend another eight steps higher. When we go from the inner court into the temple, we must ascend an additional ten steps higher. From this we can see that the temple is altogether twenty-five steps above the level of the street. </p>
<p data-content-id="_mRKRptREFnggL-PU4CvISGjQ1XwVg0KRxmxiSAqvoNRoVSn3LxL5lR9p8SgEoUoB"> Although we must climb twenty-five steps to go from the level of the street to the level of the temple, we actually ascend only fifteen cubits in height. We can calculate this because the ten steps to the temple are equal to the height of the platform of the temple. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58297" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:8">41:8</span> Ezekiel says that he saw an elevation of the temple which was six cubits high. This equals the height of the ten steps. The platform, which is six cubits high, is the base of the whole building of the temple and the side chambers. The height of the ten steps equals the six cubits. Therefore, the twenty-five steps from the level of the street to the level of the temple should be fifteen cubits. </p>
<p data-content-id="BIuz1ZsNpSVEtpe_c5-r3pd6uoK9YkuX1Qe6UHpVubV30a2gTCokxsb0a78hLe8d5"> Once again, the numbers are significant. Twenty-five is five times five, which indicates responsibility within responsibility. Fifteen is five times three, indicating the responsibility borne by the Triune God in resurrection. By putting these things together, we can see that the way to ascend higher and higher in the temple is by the responsibility within the responsibility borne by the Triune God in resurrection. We have no way to ascend higher apart from the Triune God bearing responsibility in resurrection. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="xpNFS3cnmgvzIaDTu2KkXFIEijrkbcA-vKEI4I9BgDZLERtmA4_nBIxGCUirLQktl">The Two Pillars</h2><p data-content-id="rZN_01ZRAZsGzinFwLFI_HbbgQAk6hy_uYn-1RTJR1luDvjvzFq4qNaKHBKyV5NFD"> From the steps we go on to the two pillars. We need to differentiate the pillars from the posts of the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58298" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:21">41:21</span>). The posts are square, whereas the pillars are round. While the measurements of the posts are given, they are not given <span class="pg" data-page-id="252" id="252">[252]</span> concerning the pillars. The fact that Ezekiel does not give us the measurement of the pillars indicates that they must be unlimited. Thus, these pillars signify Christ as God’s witness bearing the house of God with a strength which is unlimited and immeasurable. </p>
<p data-content-id="d4dzE-7ip2KH-msJg1h1EKGHGqowj1cY4NugEh16_n8sHykLV7fOjxuCtjBE2lIwE"> Now we come to the porch itself. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58299" data-verses="Ezekiel 40:48">Ezekiel 40:48</span> says, “He brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.” Here we have two posts which measure five cubits each. Since the number five indicates responsibility and the number two indicates testimony, the significance of these two posts is responsibility in testimony. Again the number three signifies the Triune God in resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qd35Oici55jXFQ4TZ0gj5mZ2V8eACboj_XWOxcttDFSmUnID-mvJb4Zav1g9e0C6A"> The height of the porch is twenty cubits, and the entry of the porch is fourteen cubits. As we have seen, the number fourteen is composed either of seven times two or of ten plus four. Seven signifies completion, two signifies a testimony, ten signifies fullness, and four signifies the creatures. Thus, the porch also signifies that the creatures bear a complete testimony in fullness. </p>
<p data-content-id="KoVbp6lsJDUeqDS2edMNu-pPPCCLEUJGTddYMb8btjSk16Qd0kAVfs-qPqF9MAp6E"> An additional point concerning the porch is that it is used as a lobby. This makes the temple easy to approach. In the church life we also should have a lobby, making it easy for others to come in. This means that we need to have an atmosphere that is stretching out and making it easy for others to contact us and touch us. Such a lobby makes the church accessible and enables us to take others in and hold them. In addition to making the temple approachable, the porch, or lobby, is a place where we can slow down, draw near, and prepare ourselves to enter the temple. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="l9G_FRwnnsPJj3AhWzxE9E5yDeLiGMotQr6dTzF_0AH1ohdNbcgm_L7axAmUn1xY6">The Outer Temple</h2><p data-content-id="Og7UyqSl0aJ0cDVx9zF6DFwU1DEmqh4EuqGPEZPgJGx22PnoJnULS4DqVm50PXQyB"> After we pass through the porch, we come to the outer temple. The entrance to the outer temple measures ten cubits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58300" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:2">41:2</span>). The first entrance, that of the porch, measures fourteen cubits, but the second entrance to the outer temple measures ten cubits. This indicates that the further inward <span class="pg" data-page-id="253" id="253">[253]</span> we progress, the more narrow the way becomes. As we will see, the entrance into the inner temple is even narrower, measuring six cubits. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58301" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:2">41:2</span> there are five cubits on the sides of the doors. This indicates responsibility in testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="4DeMWmLxu4b-lDGo37i201bTjb1zWN4EnLwWFLSDvmDsqxMC4sc0dt6rBw6Gtfsyn"> The length of the outer temple is forty cubits, and the breadth is twenty cubits, making a total of eight hundred square cubits. The number eight hundred indicates one hundred times resurrection. The numbers forty and twenty are multiples that can be factored by five. Twenty is four times five, and forty is eight times five. Five is composed of four (the creature) plus one (the unique God) and signifies man receiving God’s grace to bear responsibility. The number eight signifies resurrection. Therefore, composed of eight times five, forty signifies the adding together of the man as God’s creature and God in resurrection to produce something that has a perfect and complete form. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ofbGyEjAxjN2AROrgUyquOLUARe-wpexrdoqYKmUhns76yxJ-WKrBWbHDNs8KMasj">The Entries</h2><p data-content-id="3ADnnUCyZIFQmColjSiiOYFqsVIqq531s45-fiZptKzEeli67cXRD129xg1t3yvLL"> The entry into the inner temple is six cubits wide (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58302" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:3">41:3</span>). As we have seen, this shows us that the more inward we advance, the narrower the entry becomes. If we are outside the porch, we have no restriction. When we come inside the porch, we have some restriction. This restriction is not very narrow, for it is still fourteen cubits wide. However, when we pass from the porch to the outer temple, the entry is narrowed to ten cubits. Finally, when we proceed further and reach the inner temple, the entry is narrowed to six cubits. From our spiritual experience we know that the closer we are to the Lord, the more we are restricted by Him. If we are loose and careless, this is a sign that we are far off from the presence of the Lord. The closer we are to the Lord, the more we will be restricted. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="G8YLfHFDiG7w35WoxHmRogeA24lpWf0ygLEo09AQnh7gt7KesIFcUM0gixTROzO2D">The Inner Temple</h2><p data-content-id="cfNKR6_Ikj5gcAUgF2D1FtjH7hIhISr-RTlqIDpKhpHf6bnYGXOfPNwozn6omLk5q"> From the outer temple we go on to the inner temple. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58303" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:3">Ezekiel 41:3</span> says, “Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and <span class="pg" data-page-id="254" id="254">[254]</span> the breadth of the door, seven cubits.” Once again, two cubits, the measure of the post of the door, indicates testimony. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NRHnpckJ6kUzVbbOlq4UvvThShMs0xCY8-NMDod05m56iu8RUUufdxZWFCU9NFkvw">THE BUILDING AT THE BACK OF THE TEMPLE</h2><p data-content-id="t8I9sHpJ7S0cz__sqMkC5RG_zuaYvi-xEyhSUjmX-nxUewXzrG6j2mAcXlH_K87nH"> In the past I spent many hours considering the building at the back of the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58325" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:12-14">41:12-14</span>) and looking to the Lord to find out the meaning and purpose of this building. Sometimes what the Bible does not say is more meaningful than what it does say. We can know the meaning and purpose of most of the buildings in Ezekiel, but we cannot find a hint concerning the use of the building at the back. This building is larger than the temple. The temple measures one hundred cubits by sixty cubits, but the building at the back measures one hundred cubits by eighty cubits. Although this building is larger than the temple, the record does not tell the purpose of this building. </p>
<p data-content-id="hcD2jLAk2Q_I5adxkIUEbpf7H0ogxfodbVTqRxpuLmJmSrEo35x0gZeqOh4O0u4mK"> As I was studying this building, the Lord showed me that it signifies the riches of Christ. The side chambers signify the fullness of Christ, but the building at the back signifies the riches of Christ. We need to distinguish between the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ. The riches of Christ are what Christ is. For example, Christ is life, light, reality, and the way. The fullness of Christ is the church as the expression of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58326" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22-23">Eph. 1:22-23</span>). The fullness of Christ is based on the riches of Christ. When we experience and enjoy the riches of <span class="pg" data-page-id="262" id="262">[262]</span> Christ, we become the church as the fullness of Christ, His expression. Whereas the side chambers indicate the fullness of Christ, the building at the back indicates the riches of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="UANm6l8X60Ln81YDphtJcr6CAHlvd6_GJKp7S1vl6365tIU4hsCnLJVxdEpfXhTLP"> Let me give you a simple illustration of how the building at the back signifies the riches of Christ. Suppose you are a guest in a brother’s home, but instead of giving you a room to stay in, the brother asks you to sleep on the sofa in the living room. This would indicate that the brother is not rich but rather poor. However, if the brother would provide you a vacant, spacious room prepared especially for you, this would indicate that he is rich. The point here is that our Christ is very rich. Christ is so rich that He is able to fulfill all the requirements and meet all the needs of both God and man and still have a large “building” left. This building indicates that Christ is rich, with an abundance left over. </p>
<p data-content-id="TnPiuEpy87hQJz8U3MuArh8E5Y8jxOnarHGWQvC9iBsDYVqVbp5NKVgBsK6amROCx"> We should not think that as the building of God Christ is only as much as we need. In principle, Christ as the building always has something left over, and what is left over exceeds what is used. We need to remember that five loaves fed five thousand people with twelve baskets left over (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58327" data-verses="John 6:12-13">John 6:12-13</span>). The amount left over was greater than the amount at hand at the beginning. This indicates that Christ is unlimited. Behind the portion of Christ that we need is an even greater portion that is “vacant.” Unlike an apartment building displaying a sign that says “No Vacancy,” with Christ the “sign” always says “Vacant.” Because Christ is unsearchably rich, He is a “building” that is always “vacant.” </p>
<p data-content-id="nspAW8ybtAwd-FktD5YN4Bhw4ftVLabqi3PMGvjyYxVnV4VwKoIMl0lUt0qaHwvp9"> The size of this building—one hundred cubits by eighty cubits—is significant. Eighty is ten times eight. The number eight signifies resurrection, and the number ten signifies fullness. The number eighty, therefore, indicates resurrection in fullness. Furthermore, the area of this building is eight thousand cubits square, that is, one hundred times eighty. In other words, it is one thousand times of resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="6qZ5AXEp8asjHStkAiRCcTZuTIzlXOIcRxYU_wF5J7VdKbK50VwX457J7bPXvUbLm"> The dimensions of the building at the back include the wall, which is five cubits thick on all four sides. The actual capacity of the building is seventy cubits by ninety cubits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58328" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:12">Ezek. 41:12</span>). These numbers also are significant. Seventy is <span class="pg" data-page-id="263" id="263">[263]</span> ten times seven, ninety is ten times nine, and nine is three times three. These numbers indicate completion (seven), fullness (ten), resurrection (eight), and the Triune God (three). All this shows us how rich Christ is. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Rrf22uMBNQan9P4T7jHi1anH-KDQyypij84f2YwjWmMEgM7jEdvf-sug8okDcYg7H">THE SIZE OF THE TEMPLE AND THE SEPARATE AREA IN FRONT OF IT AND BEHIND IT</h2><p data-content-id="sTV0uWaZaR7-etDNprDCJz8PFBlH8qHOUJZKsAEyg7zQL_4KVEdzSLh5sv9V5JA-d"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58329" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:13-15">Ezekiel 41:13-15</span> gives us the size of the temple and the separate area in front of it and behind it: “So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long; also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits. And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court.” The temple is one hundred cubits long, and the width of the front of the temple and of the separate area along the east side totals one hundred cubits. The width of the nave is twenty cubits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58330" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:2">vv. 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58331" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:4">4</span>). The thickness of the two sides of the wall is twelve cubits altogether, with each side six cubits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58332" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:5">v. 5</span>). The width of the side chambers is four cubits on each side, altogether eight cubits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58333" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:5">v. 5</span>). The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers is five cubits on each side, altogether ten cubits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58334" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:9">v. 9</span>). The width of the space left along the side chambers is five cubits on both sides, altogether ten cubits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58335" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:9">v. 9</span>). When we add all these, we have sixty cubits. The separate area between the side chambers belonging to the temple and the outer chambers is twenty cubits in width on both sides of the temple. If we add all these together, we have one hundred cubits. This makes a square with one hundred cubits on each side, signifying that Christ is absolutely perfect, upright, complete, and plentiful as the dwelling place of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="wg-jmis-AhzGwVom8C3CXkIDTF3liGiqarrGBZKYNwYK61MYfi1wuCb7PAN8DXDzF"> The width of the inner court, the front of the temple, and the area along the east side, is one hundred cubits and its length is also one hundred cubits. Thus, this area, which has the altar as its center, is also a square with one hundred cubits on each side. This is a further indication that Christ is <span class="pg" data-page-id="264" id="264">[264]</span> perfect, upright, and complete and that He is fully qualified to be used by God to accomplish His work of redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="L2WIjxRxjPexB4ljS1Z9-7hkwFKqDMsdmNq-kfPc-ASSG92jR6I00KWKAAuB8m_gB"> The separate area with the building at the back and its wall is one hundred cubits long (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58336" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:13">v. 13</span>). The length of the building along the front of the separate area behind it, with a gallery on each side, is one hundred cubits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58337" data-verses="Ezekiel 41:15">v. 15</span>), and its width is also one hundred cubits. Here at the back of the temple we have another square with one hundred cubits on each side. This is yet another indication that Christ is perfect, upright, and complete. He is more than sufficient to meet all the needs of both God and man with an abundant surplus remaining. The surplus of Christ is surely plentiful. </p>
<p data-content-id="mGlXzQXS93cQ2872KI0vxvycgdCV-G1UsJYVrLVxuEDM8b9zGL6DI--iW39DhFc3_"> This marvelous arrangement reveals the wisdom of our God. Altogether we have three pieces of land, all of which are one hundred cubits square. This indicates that in the Triune God there is one hundred times of complete squares and one hundred times of plentiful surplus. </p>

<p data-content-id="jclG18nLWkHIJs8mAdEhZFxIj33ctFrdNhIpmn7itG20nB0Co0rExkOSleSpjIvW_"> After the completion of the building of the house, the glory of the Lord returned. In his early ministry Ezekiel had seen the glory of the Lord depart in a series of steps. First, the glory of the Lord left the temple and hesitated upon the threshold (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58369" data-verses="Ezekiel 9:3">Ezek. 9:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58370" data-verses="Ezekiel 10:4">10:4</span>). From the threshold it went out to the city. From the city the glory of the Lord went further out to the Mount of Olives on the east side of the city (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58371" data-verses="Ezekiel 11:23">11:23</span>), and from there the glory of the Lord ascended to the heavens. </p>
<p data-content-id="TnPiuEpy87hQJz8U3MuArgME-KcjxOnarHGWQvC9iBsDYVqVbp5NKVgBsK6amROCx"> When the Lord in His leaving stopped on the threshold of the house, this indicated that He was not happy to leave. He did not want to leave, but He was forced to do so. Indicating His unwillingness to leave, He hesitated and lingered at the threshold. Eventually, He was forced to leave because of the abomination, whoredom, and degradation of the people. But now the glory of the Lord is returning by the same way He left. He departed from the east side, and now He is returning from the east (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58372" data-verses="Ezekiel 43:1-3">43:1-3</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nspAW8ybtAwd-FktD5YN4ARw-NdVLabqi3PMGvjyYxVnV4VwKoIMl0lUt0qaHwvp9">THE GLORY RETURNING<br/>BECAUSE THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE<br/>WAS COMPLETED</h2><p data-content-id="6qZ5AXEp8asjHStkAiRCcSpuaazlXOIcRxYU_wF5J7VdKbK50VwX457J7bPXvUbLm"> It is important for us to understand why the glory of the Lord came back. The glory of the Lord returned because the building of the temple was completed. This is the crucial point. How much the Lord desires to come back to the earth! Yet, for His coming back He needs a place for the soles of His feet to rest, a place upon which He can set His feet. His habitation, His house, is the place on earth where He can put His feet. <span class="pg" data-page-id="274" id="274">[274]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Rrf22uMBNQan9P4T7jHi1bXH2YTQyypij84f2YwjWmMEgM7jEdvf-sug8okDcYg7H"> Throughout the centuries the enemy in his subtlety has kept Christians from knowing anything about the building. Christian teachers emphasize greatly the matter of salvation and to some extent the matter of spirituality, but they rarely emphasize the matter of building. God’s concern is not merely with salvation or with spirituality but with the building. For years the Lord has burdened us with one thing—the building. The building is nothing other than the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZN_01ZRAZsGzinFwLFI_G7bgSAk6hy_uYn-1RTJR1luDvjvzFq4qNaKHBKyV5NFD"> Brother Watchman Nee was fully committed by the Lord with the burden for the church. I knew him very well, and I knew that he was burdened for the church and for the building of the church. He realized that for the building up of the church, there was the need of the inner life, and the Lord gave him many messages on the inner life. However, these messages were not released so that people could be spiritual in an individual way but so that the church could be built up. All of his messages on the inner life were for the building up of the church. But the subtle enemy, Satan, has utilized some so-called spiritual people to publish many of his messages on the inner life to be used for individual spirituality. Those who put out the inner-life books by Brother Nee do not have much regard for his books on the church life. Many Christian bookstores sell <em>The Normal Christian Life; Sit, Walk, Stand; What Shall This Man Do?; The Song of Songs;</em> and so forth—all books on the individual spiritual life—but very few sell Brother Nee’s books on the church. They seldom sell <em>The Normal Christian Church Life, The Glorious Church,Further Talks on the Church Life,</em> or other books by Brother Nee that have the word <em>church</em> in the title. Here we can see the enemy’s subtlety. </p>
<p data-content-id="d4dzE-7ip2KH-msJg1h1ELmHGoowj1cY4NugEh16_n8sHykLV7fOjxuCtjBE2lIwE"> Do you believe that the Lord cares only for spirituality? Let me assure you that the Lord does not care merely for spirituality; He cares for the building up of the church. Regarding this, we need to expose the subtlety of the enemy. Some have said that Witness Lee is different from Watchman Nee—that Watchman Nee is for the spiritual life but Witness Lee is too much for the church. That Brother Nee was not only for the spiritual life but also very much for the church is <span class="pg" data-page-id="275" id="275">[275]</span> indicated by his books such as <em>Further Talks on the Church Life, The Orthodoxy of the Church,</em> and <em>The Glorious Church</em>. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qd35Oici55jXFQ4TZ0gj5n52W8-ACboj_XWOxcttDFSmUnID-mvJb4Zav1g9e0C6A"> Today the Lord is not concerned merely for individual spirituality. Even if many spiritual people such as Daniel had been raised up in Babylon, the glory of the Lord would not have gone there to fill them. The Lord’s glory did not return to Daniel; rather, it returned to the temple after it was rebuilt. </p>
<p data-content-id="KoVbp6lsJDUeqDS2edMNu_JPMCiLEUJGTddYMb8btjSk16Qd0kAVfs-qPqF9MAp6E"> After the measuring of the whole building, the Spirit brought Ezekiel to the east gate where he saw the appearance of the glory of the Lord returning. “And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58373" data-verses="Ezekiel 43:3">Ezek. 43:3</span>). When I first read this verse, I thought that the word <em>I</em> should be <em>He</em>. To my impression, the verse should read, “When He came to destroy the city.” Nevertheless, the proper translation is, “When I came to destroy the city.” It seems strange that Ezekiel would say that he came to destroy the city. This means that when the prophet went to Jerusalem, the Lord also went to Jerusalem. The Lord went there in Ezekiel’s going there. In his earlier ministry, Ezekiel saw the glory of the Lord leave the temple and the city, but in his later ministry he saw the glory coming back to the house of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="l9G_FRwnnsPJj3AhWzxE9FZyAfriGMotQr6dTzF_0AH1ohdNbcgm_L7axAmUn1xY6"> We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the glory of God returned only after the building of the temple was completed. If we want to dwell in the church and manifest His glory in the church, the church must be complete. If the church today corresponds to all the details of the holy building of God covered in these chapters of Ezekiel and thus is built up in every aspect, God will dwell in the church gloriously. Therefore, in order for the glorious God to dwell in the church, the church must be built up to become the dwelling place of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Og7UyqSl0aJ0cDVx9zF6DEQU2Ckmqh4EuqGPEZPgJGx22PnoJnULS4DqVm50PXQyB"> God wants to have the church built up on earth because He desires to have a dwelling place on earth. He, the God of the heavens, wants to live on the earth. The place where He lives, His dwelling place, is the church. Since God dwells in <span class="pg" data-page-id="276" id="276">[276]</span> the church, those who want to seek God and contact Him must come to the church. Our main burden in this study of Ezekiel is to see the dwelling place which God desires to have on earth. If we have the grace to be built up in the church, the God of glory will live among us. </p>

The direction of the sunrise signifies glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58375" data-verses="Numbers 2:3">Num. 2:3</span>). The Lord came back from the glory. He left toward the east, and He came back from the east. </p>

This indicates that whenever the Lord’s glory comes back to the church, there will be a great deal of noise. When the Lord’s glory leaves, we should be quiet. Quietness indicates that the glory is gone, but noise is a sign that glory has returned. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58377" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span>, on the day of Pentecost, it was not quiet. “There was a sound out of heaven, as of a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58378" data-verses="Acts 2:2">v. 2</span>). Whenever the church is revived, there will be a loud sound and a great noise. </p>

There was no darkness. On the day of Pentecost, the city of Jerusalem was under the shining of such a light. Whenever the church has a revival, God’s glory is expressed, the voice of God is heard, and God’s glory shines forth. However, without the manifestation of God and the voice of God, there is darkness. </p>

This means that everything we do needs to be according to the church, which is God’s house. The standard of measurement is neither good behavior nor personal spirituality; the standard of measurement is the church. All that we are and do must be measured, tested, by God’s house, the church. </p>

Then said the Lord unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the Lord the God of Israel hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut. It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.” The east gate was special because God had entered into the temple through this gate (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58404" data-verses="Ezekiel 43:1">43:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58405" data-verses="Ezekiel 43:4">4</span>). This gate was to be shut, and only “the prince” could enter in by it and sit in it to eat bread before the Lord. The prince here is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="288" id="288">[288]</span> king in the coming millennial kingdom, and surely this prince is Christ. This word about the east gate indicates that Christ and God have an equal position, for after God had entered in by this gate, the only other person who can do so is Christ. Only Christ can enter in and go out by the gate through which God has passed. This reveals that God and Christ have a special, holy portion among God’s people. </p>

<p data-content-id="As5RuqkUNs_QiZFPbIMPIbGsJW2jaGSkxZFJj9qFrh1olgghfpp9B3mssRvvCbg_p"> If we would serve the Lord in His house, the church, we need to be circumcised (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58406" data-verses="Ezekiel 44:9">44:9</span>). Uncircumcised persons are not qualified to serve in God’s house. Circumcision typifies dealing with the flesh, the natural man, and the old man by the cross. To us as believers in Christ, circumcision today is not something outward but an inward dealing by the cross with the flesh, the natural man, and the old man. If our flesh, natural man, and old man have not been dealt with by the cross, we are not qualified to serve in the church life. Rather, we are considered by the Lord to be a stranger. A stranger is an uncircumcised person, someone whose flesh, natural man, and old man have not been dealt with by the cross. We may be real believers, but if we have not dealt with our flesh, natural man, and old man by the cross, the Lord regards us as strangers, those who are not qualified to serve in the church life. We need to bring this matter to the Lord and ask Him about our flesh, natural man, and old man. These things must be dealt with through the working of the cross. Only then will we be circumcised and qualified to serve the Lord in the church life. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="FIwJ3qsV0mAwigCPE19nFlVAjwhxca5caBJgl1SwOL2Bj2VbKIKDuM59RyUdUoB__">Being like the Sons of Zadok</h2><p data-content-id="C92KRmALSxN5rAScVq8h3bh0xxOAIB1PguamKjHkO2548nR0HClW6SzIeuBtdPCFg"> When the majority of the people went astray, some of the circumcised ones also went astray (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58407" data-verses="Ezekiel 44:10">44:10</span>). Although these ones were circumcised, they went astray from God to idols by following those who went astray. Because these circumcised ones went astray, we may say that they were only half qualified to serve the Lord. On the one hand, they were qualified <span class="pg" data-page-id="289" id="289">[289]</span> because they were circumcised; on the other hand, they were not qualified because they had gone astray from God to idols. Their circumcision qualified them, but their going astray disqualified them. </p>
<p data-content-id="PV2fNgIGsuE-bUFgF7Z0qOyXo_jTxnhBooHdZuUQ9Das4Je1zEiSHqrsJ0upsJB4U"> What should the Lord do with them, and what was His attitude toward them? The Lord said that such persons could serve in the house, but they could not come near to the Lord or to the holy things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58408" data-verses="Ezekiel 44:11-14">vv. 11-14</span>). They could minister in the temple by helping the people to present their offerings, but they could not come near to the Lord and serve Him. Some of the saints in the church life today are also half qualified. In a sense they are circumcised, but in another sense they have gone astray with the majority of the people. To follow the majority is awful. Consider today’s situation: Most Christians have gone astray from the Lord to idols, and some of the saints in the church have followed the majority in going astray from the Lord. Because the majority of Christians have gone astray, they have lost their qualification and position to serve the Lord in a direct way. They may still have a part of the church service, but it is an indirect service to the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="-wKvpHCzaienBNn1FUrefwsWgfWSNwMXmd0XuRQTF8l38jLFug9nKYw9UAgkaYR6g"> We all need to be like the sons of Zadok, who were circumcised and absolutely faithful to the Lord. They never went astray, following the majority of the people. They were circumcised and they were always honest and faithful to the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58409" data-verses="Ezekiel 44:15-16">vv. 15-16</span>). Therefore, they could serve the Lord in a direct way. The Lord said that they could come near to Him and serve Him directly. They were not limited merely to serve the people; they could serve the Lord Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="p38LhWt-j07U2iMCnpvTTzNj62Kmv3mR3L5H63FoAbrSm3ahMmnisRyTT9j-cFYQW"> I hope that none of us is only half qualified. I hope that all of us will be fully qualified: circumcised, honest, never going astray, and never following the majority. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="v8e1FNT-phHR2DucAbCpZ1HsY_fK-HGbsUyvlVBbqjrDFw4byAhaNfrI7B0v1zrtp">Offering the Fat and the Blood</h2><p data-content-id="WfEVbagx2vme1BiQhHb5DmY_rxXwiPb1Nstsb4tLT0KnncoTQeDqZVNZPsaUBaDG-"> At this juncture we need to consider how the circumcised, faithful, and qualified ones serve the Lord. First, they serve by offering the fat and the blood of the offerings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58410" data-verses="Ezekiel 44:15">v. 15</span>). The most precious part of the offerings is the fat, which typifies the precious person of the Lord Jesus. Whereas the fat typifies the preciousness of the person of Christ, the blood <span class="pg" data-page-id="290" id="290">[290]</span> signifies the redemptive work of Christ. In brief, the fat signifies the person of Christ and the blood signifies the work of Christ. In our service to God, we must present to Him the precious person of Christ and the redemptive work of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="2PYXRuBRbk3pazLkKTlYtAUinSwv15ApCa1VN8KxIix8cbBt0J74ZrjjS6AX6gZ1X">Not Wearing Any Woolen Garment</h2><p data-content-id="uLbh7taL_7-XoK9Q8ONqMyoE8gPJobsJZa-NymaFABQVYF3nbW2_GsMshc2YHU6b6"> When the priests came in to minister to the Lord, they were not allowed to wear any woolen garment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58411" data-verses="Ezekiel 44:17">v. 17</span>). Instead, while they were in the Lord’s presence serving Him, they had to wear linen garments. In the Bible linen signifies a behavior, a living, that is pure, clean, and fine. Linen garments signify a daily living and walk in the life-giving Spirit by the life of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="fLosXWms1KYdGPCBWfcZOUSDy9uQ_A9Ht8UGClPEeBQVlDGoJcH_conm1QNn2Q_o4"> The priests were not allowed to wear woolen garments because woolen garments would make the priests too warm and cause them to sweat. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58412" data-verses="Genesis 3:19">Genesis 3:19</span> sweat is a sign of being under God’s curse. Because fallen man is under God’s curse, he must labor and sweat. Under the curse man, lacking God’s blessing, must exercise his energy and strength, which cause sweating. In the Lord’s service there is no need for us to use our own strength. When we use our own strength to endeavor and struggle, this proves that we are not under the Lord’s blessing but rather are under the Lord’s curse. </p>

<p data-content-id="fLosXWms1KYdGPCBWfcZOUiD1veQ_A9Ht8UGClPEeBQVlDGoJcH_conm1QNn2Q_o4"> The book of Ezekiel speaks of two rivers. The first river, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58451" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">chapter one</span>, is the river Chebar, which was in the place where the people of God were held in captivity. The second river, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58452" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:1">chapter forty-seven</span>, is the river of life in the holy land. The first river is for carrying out judgment; the second river is for supplying life. To be near the river Chebar is to be in a place of discipline, but to be near the river of living water is to be in a place to receive life. In this message we will consider the river flowing from the house. </p>

Both the tree and the river signify that God desires to impart Himself to man as life. The tree of life indicates that God wants us to eat Him, and the river indicates that God wants us to drink Him. The tree and the river in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58456" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> are the beginning of two lines—one concerning God as living food and another concerning God as living water—that run throughout the Bible until they consummate with the tree of life and with the river of water of life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58457" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span>. Regarding God as man’s food, the Bible speaks of the meat of the lamb, the unleavened bread, the manna, the various offerings, and all the produce, both animal and vegetable, of the good land of Canaan. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58458" data-verses="John 6:1">John 6</span> the Lord Jesus spoke clearly about this: “I am the bread of life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58459" data-verses="John 6:48">v. 48</span>); “I am the living bread which came down out of heaven” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58460" data-verses="John 6:51">v. 51</span>); “My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58461" data-verses="John 6:55">v. 55</span>); “he who eats Me, he also shall live because <span class="pg" data-page-id="302" id="302">[302]</span> of Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58462" data-verses="John 6:57">v. 57</span>). Regarding God as water for man to drink, the Bible speaks of the spring (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58463" data-verses="Exodus 15:27">Exo. 15:27</span>), the water out of the rock (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58464" data-verses="Exodus 17:6">17:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58465" data-verses="Numbers 20:11">Num. 20:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58466" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:4">1 Cor. 10:4</span>), the water from the well (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58467" data-verses="Numbers 21:16-17">Num. 21:16-17</span>), and water from the ground (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58468" data-verses="Judges 15:19">Judg. 15:19</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58469" data-verses="Psalms 36:8">Psalm 36:8b</span> says, “Thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58470" data-verses="Psalms 46:4">Psalm 46:4</span> says, “There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, / the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58471" data-verses="Joel 3:18">Joel 3:18</span> says, “A fountain shall come forth of the house of the Lord.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58472" data-verses="Zechariah 14:8">Zechariah 14:8</span> says, “It shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem.” The Gospel of John speaks of the living water in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58473" data-verses="John 4:14">4:14</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58474" data-verses="John 7:37-38">7:37-38</span>. These portions of the Word reveal that God as living water has flowed out from eternity into us to satisfy our thirst. </p>
<p data-content-id="XepL-yKvCOMfBVF1zePEl3fxDfnDxci6eLedCPyLziLypB00oXRDxbo8XzhFKTQ4h"> The portion of the Word that describes the flow of the living water of God in the most detail is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58475" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:1">Ezekiel 47</span>. It is significant that the flow of the river of life is not in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58476" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">chapter one</span>. In that chapter, instead of the river of life, there was a consuming fire. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58477" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:1">chapter thirty-seven</span> there was a wind that became breath to us, but there was no water flowing. The flowing of the water did not begin until <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58478" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:1">chapter forty-seven</span>. The water could not come in before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58479" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:1">chapter forty-seven</span>, because the house had not been built up. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="k4Ajjh-9TG5V-Yz5rWAXw4XpmGAD6qGu0sspdVg7meIXyXNW5MC3fw76TFIIoEuvx">THE FACTORS WHICH PRODUCED THE RIVER</h2><p data-content-id="3ADnnUCyZIFQmColjSiiOZFqvUoqq531s45-fiZptKzEeli67cXRD129xg1t3yvLL"> Several crucial factors brought in the flow of the river. The first was the building up and completion of the house. Following this, the people began to have their living according to the house, according to its pattern, laws, and statutes. Their daily life and all their conduct began to be according to the form, fashion, pattern, statutes, and laws of the house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58480" data-verses="Ezekiel 43:10-11">43:10-11</span>). Next, the serving ones, the priests, were serving the Lord in a proper way. Finally, there were all the offerings: one lamb out of two hundred, one-sixtieth of the wheat and barley, and one-hundredth of the oil. There were yearly offerings, monthly offerings, daily offerings, and all the solemn feasts. We need to realize that the experience of all these matters brought in the flow of the river. </p>
<p data-content-id="G8YLfHFDiG7w35WoxHmRoheA15FpWf0ygLEo09AQnh7gt7KesIFcUM0gixTROzO2D"> When the Lord saw all these things, He must have been <span class="pg" data-page-id="303" id="303">[303]</span> very happy. He had a house—the place of His throne, a place for the soles of His feet, a place where He could dwell for His rest and satisfaction. He saw the house with its forms and statutes, and He saw the priests and the offerings. Therefore, He sent the flowing of the river, and the river began to flow out of the house. </p>
<p data-content-id="cfNKR6_Ikj5gcAUgF2D1FsjH4johISr-RTlqIDpKhpHf6bnYGXOfPNwozn6omLk5q"> Now we can understand why there is no mention of the flowing of the river before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58481" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:1">chapter forty-seven</span>. The flow of the river depends on the building. Whenever and wherever a group of believers is built up in oneness as described by Ezekiel, there will be the flowing of the river out of the building. If there is the building in your locality, the flow will come forth out from the building. Suppose regarding the church in your locality the Lord can say, “This is the place of My throne, this is the place where I can put the soles of My feet, and this is the place where I can dwell, rest, and be satisfied.” If the Lord is able to say this about your place, the river will surely flow out of the building. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y6VPJt1oDg8WbmA7biITMzzWafOc88cF2EKdOPvQBDrnx0Sx5TXxBKCVwq3Eo1b_t"> Today many zealous Christians pay attention to outreach and to gospel work in the mission field, yet their situation is quite poor. They go out to work for the Lord, but no flow follows them, because they neglect the source—the building up of the church. There can be no flow apart from the genuine building. If there is a strong building up in the local churches, there will be a river flowing out of the building to other places. There will be the flowing, the flooding, and the impact. </p>
<p data-content-id="EozqjcK3WHH7oN8cuyeAI7JZT8gbTidaE9HxDWd_xQtr_HoZoj_xVW3P53sr-ZAZx"> How much we need the building! We need the church to be built up as the temple, the house of God. Out of such a building, the flow of God will issue. The outreach depends on the building. The preaching of the gospel depends on the building. This is the reason that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58482" data-verses="John 17:23">John 17:23</span> the Lord Jesus said that when we are perfected into one, the world will know that the Father has sent the Son. This means that when we are built up as one, the world will be convinced. The divided situation of Christianity greatly limits the impact of the gospel. </p>

This indicates that if we, through Christ, have more contact with God and draw closer to Him, there will be an opening which will allow the living water of God to flow out from the church. </p>

The east is the direction of the glory of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58485" data-verses="Numbers 2:3">Num. 2:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58486" data-verses="Ezekiel 43:2">Ezek. 43:2</span>). The flowing toward the east indicates that the river of God will always flow in the direction of God’s glory. The river cares for God’s glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="5B77wnH1FzY8BLTY6fCXLKA8cFPk2y-0-wcSHFSE7ZmUp0tp06z5YVYlyz-mtu8g6"> Everything in the church life should be for God’s glory. For example, in our preaching of the gospel, we should seek the glory of God. If our gospel preaching is for God’s glory, there will be an outflow of living water. However, if we do not care for the glory of God, the flow will be limited. Everyone in the church should seek and care for the glory of God. Then the living water will flow out from the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NRHnpckJ6kUzVbbOlq4UvuDhWzss0xCY8-NMDod05m56iu8RUUufdxZWFCU9NFkvw">THE WATER FLOWING OUT<br/>FROM THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HOUSE</h2><p data-content-id="t8I9sHpJ7S0cz__sqMkC5QW_28qYvi-xEyhSUjmX-nxUewXzrG6j2mAcXlH_K87nH"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58487" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:1">Ezekiel 47:1c</span> also tells us that the water flows out from the right side of the house. According to the Bible the right side signifies the highest position. The flowing of the water from the right side indicates that the flow of the Lord should have the preeminence. We need to give the Lord the highest position, and we also need to give the flow of the Lord the highest position. Then the flow will be prevailing and become the controlling factor in our living and work. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8rxS5dZWVru-86TEaA6zO7ZjKoLANmg5-TyvgQviBBdA2QzpLMdh_9X48Yc1XaXBM">THE HOLY LAND</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="0mK3LkhfG47nUOjE9-zWv84wLZU0lXbjvbrleLxaYyGQ2fu_UAK3zSTJrVOIAjqAC">The Temple Being the Issue of the Land </h2>
<p data-content-id="7dtg_xWd_1oVROwVwjxL70Dd18HBvmuWOR1SM6eDsY7qUofk88XbvGJSfbzR4yZMY"> We need to see something further concerning the holy land. Apart from the land, there can be no temple. We may appreciate the temple very much, but we need to realize that the temple is in the land and that without the land there cannot be a temple. The temple, which typifies the church, is the issue of the land, which typifies Christ. Thus, the temple depends on the land. If we do not have the experience of Christ, it is impossible for us to have the church. The church is the issue of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="_mRKRptREFnggL-PU4CvITWjYmnwVg0KRxmxiSAqvoNRoVSn3LxL5lR9p8SgEoUoB">A History of the Land</h2><p data-content-id="WfEVbagx2vme1BiQhHb5Dm4_rzXwiPb1Nstsb4tLT0KnncoTQeDqZVNZPsaUBaDG-"> The land is first mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58512" data-verses="Genesis 1:9">Genesis 1:9</span>. On the third day of the Lord’s recovery of His creation, the land was recovered, for on this day the land emerged from the waters of death. Prior to that time, the land had been under the death waters. But on the third day the Lord caused the land to rise up out of the waters of death. The land here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58513" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> typifies Christ, who was resurrected from the dead on the third day as the all-inclusive land. Every kind of life—plant life, animal life, and human life—came out of this land. All manner of living beings issued out of the land. Since the land <span class="pg" data-page-id="314" id="314">[314]</span> signifies Christ, this means that all these living things came out of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="2PYXRuBRbk3pazLkKTlYtA0inQwv15ApCa1VN8KxIix8cbBt0J74ZrjjS6AX6gZ1X"> Christ is the good land which God prepared for man. However, man fell and became degraded, and this caused God to judge the earth again. During the time of Noah, the land was flooded and again was covered by the waters of death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58514" data-verses="Genesis 7:19">7:19</span>). As a result, the human race lost the land. But the Lord again brought the land out of the death waters, and the family of Noah was given the right to enjoy the land. </p>
<p data-content-id="uLbh7taL_7-XoK9Q8ONqMyIE_gvJobsJZa-NymaFABQVYF3nbW2_GsMshc2YHU6b6"> Human history is a record of man’s fall. In the course of this history, the descendants of Noah fell and eventually gathered at Babel to build a tower of rebellion against God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58515" data-verses="Genesis 11:1-9">11:1-9</span>). Then “the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58516" data-verses="Genesis 11:8">v. 8a</span>). Later God called Abraham out from the land of Babel and brought him into Canaan, the good land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58517" data-verses="Genesis 12:1-8">12:1-8</span>). Eventually, however, the descendants of Abraham fell from the good land into Egypt. The whole house of Israel went down into Egypt, and thus they lost the good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="fLosXWms1KYdGPCBWfcZOUyDx9OQ_A9Ht8UGClPEeBQVlDGoJcH_conm1QNn2Q_o4"> Four hundred years later, by God’s deliverance, the people of Israel experienced the passover, left Egypt, and passed through the Red Sea (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58518" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exo. 12—14</span>). After forty years of wandering in the wilderness, they crossed the Jordan into the good land. Fighting against the inhabitants of the land, they recovered their lost land. Upon the recovered land they built the temple, and God’s glory filled it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58519" data-verses="2Chronicles 5:14">2 Chron. 5:14</span>). Later, due to their falling away from the Lord and their degradation, they were carried away from the land and lost it once again. </p>
<p data-content-id="IX_UvHDiNQNKuMzDpACM4xsR-L2jmOXo9otBId5AM2tk46g0M3mHb3T-Twt1do4v1"> In the midst of the captivity, Ezekiel was brought back to the land by the Spirit and saw the land. In our reading of Ezekiel, we need to pay attention to the fact that many times the Lord promised to bring His people back to the land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58520" data-verses="Ezekiel 11:1">chs. 11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58521" data-verses="Ezekiel 33:1">33</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58522" data-verses="Ezekiel 34:1">34</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58523" data-verses="Ezekiel 36:1">36</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58524" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:1">37</span>). He even promised to bring them back to the top of the mountain of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58525" data-verses="Ezekiel 34:14">34:14</span>). This indicates a recovery of the land. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ha_9caqJ-gtW20LDfXmweVAsUo3on1Pc0q0siMVKOik-gRx59IRw2r9MVWNDzyftI"> It is crucial for us to realize that before we can have the recovery of the building, we need to have the recovery of the land. The recovery of the land signifies the recovery of the enjoyment of Christ. Christ Himself cannot be lost, but in our <span class="pg" data-page-id="315" id="315">[315]</span> experience Christ can be lost. When we were saved, we received Christ. However, not long afterward we fell away and lost Christ in our experience. The recovery of the land is the recovery of the experiences of the riches of Christ. Once the land has been recovered, the house can be built on the land. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="XepL-yKvCOMfBVF1zePEl3PxKMnDxci6eLedCPyLziLypB00oXRDxbo8XzhFKTQ4h">A Land of Milk and Honey</h2><p data-content-id="k4Ajjh-9TG5V-Yz5rWAXw4HpuVQD6qGu0sspdVg7meIXyXNW5MC3fw76TFIIoEuvx"> The land, with all its riches, is called a land “flowing with milk and honey” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58526" data-verses="Ezekiel 20:6">20:6</span>). Milk and honey are both the product of two lives working together—the vegetable life and the animal life. It takes both the vegetable life and the animal life to produce milk and honey. To produce milk we need cattle, the animal life, and also the pasture, the vegetable life. Milk is therefore the product of these two lives working together. The principle is the same with honey. Honey is produced by bees, but the bees need the flowers of many different kinds of plants. Therefore, both milk and honey are the produce of these two kinds of lives. </p>
<p data-content-id="JYnuRkNofqaCL_SuH1kdeTdsIz_6Xfa3kN3GnclC0uwXkYmOk2tHLkh0JpDrtZKzP"> As our good land, Christ has two kinds of lives; He has the vegetable life and the animal life. The Gospel of John indicates this. On the one hand, the Lord Jesus said that He was a grain of wheat (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58527" data-verses="John 12:24">12:24</span>); this is the vegetable life. On the other hand, this Gospel says that Christ is the Lamb of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58528" data-verses="John 1:29">1:29</span>); this is the animal life. The animal life is for being slain so that blood may be shed for redemption, whereas the vegetable life is for producing and generating life. One grain of wheat falls into the ground, dies, grows up, and multiplies into many grains. Thus, with Christ we have the animal life for redemption and the vegetable life for germination. Out of these two lives mingled together, we have the riches of Christ—the milk and honey—for our enjoyment. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="zqHbu0U7uWGsnviHhDYAUewirJd65EDd4MObME8uyyFF5Of7TpcGEbbReHiBZe4IV">The Borders of the Land</h2><p data-content-id="aO4fP_PJksfCXqSijn9t3jeBO5zAdwfYZbIFme-3od23Mf0x5MkBQvzpVrexMT24W"> Ezekiel presents the borders of the good land in a particular yet wonderful way. He says that the border on the west is the Great Sea (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58529" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:20">47:20</span>). This indicates that the coast of the Mediterranean Sea is the western border. Ezekiel tells us that there is also a sea on the east side (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58530" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:18">v. 18</span>). The sea on the east is not the Great Sea; it is the Dead Sea. At the top of <span class="pg" data-page-id="316" id="316">[316]</span> the Dead Sea is the river Jordan, which proceeds northward to another sea, the Sea of Galilee, or the Sea of Tiberias. Another river, the river of Egypt, is the border of the good land on the south (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58531" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:19">v. 19</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="bdSLpeqsU89fPsdy5AnMvSKy5q1M9m_hi3bf9lycl88fNhg1oeUrZ3wbkkhWUYCI7"> The position of the good land between the waters of the Great Sea on the west and the waters of the Dead Sea on the east is significant. For the good land to be surrounded by water indicates that it is surrounded by death. In the Dead Sea there is nothing but death, and in the Great Sea there is salt water, which signifies death. Furthermore, in typology the Jordan River signifies death. Thus, the good land is surrounded by death, but it is not overflooded by death. This reminds us of the land that came up out of the waters of death on the third day, thereby signifying the resurrected Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="qwE1WvkY1-QdIiK-pNapN1nzgjg-ugMEQCCUavkTc47dhd_OFD4OTSFvqKJ970JrB"> Certain portions of the Word indicate that the good land of Canaan is an elevated land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58532" data-verses="Deuteronomy 32:13">Deut. 32:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58533" data-verses="Ezekiel 20:40-42">Ezek. 20:40-42</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58534" data-verses="Ezekiel 34:13-15">34:13-15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58535" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:22">37:22</span>). The good land is a raised-up land, typifying Christ being raised, elevated, from the dead. Hence, the good land is not a low land but a high land. Whereas the Dead Sea is hundreds of feet below sea level, Mount Zion is hundreds of feet above sea level. This signifies that the good land, as a type of the resurrected Christ, is an elevated land. </p>
<p data-content-id="yOtH1HV3kPzgY3hZDsHMMLwegdWklV8y--_Y9J7-0p3T-YCB3UCimInlfqgVbKpbr"> On the north side of the good land, there is no river as a border; instead, there is Mount Hermon. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58536" data-verses="Psalms 133:1">Psalm 133</span> the dew comes down from Mount Hermon and descends upon the mountains of Zion. This signifies that grace comes down from the heavens and descends upon all the local churches. This elevated land with Mount Hermon signifies the resurrected Christ, who has ascended to the heavens. Now there is not only resurrection but also ascension, for Christ is not only the resurrected Christ but also the ascended Christ. He is above the death waters, and He has ascended to the high mountain, Mount Hermon. </p>
