<p data-content-id="_PvEYsXiFmZwXDUmG4C1cmfxaOE2cbndJ8aWw0cKC93htOGdUbpk63Zumr3auvyar"> As we begin the life-study of Judges, I have the burden to speak a word concerning the intrinsic significance of this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="BcuFtgPLokHbA0UAs-YL_750BGygPXyL6cDJVy74--5FeG0keGsJyL1bW-vmd8W5F"> In order to understand the history in the Old Testament, we need the full scope of the Scriptures. If we read the Old Testament according to this full scope, we will realize that at Mount Sinai God married Israel. In His concept and desire, He wanted to be to Israel as a husband to a wife, and He expected Israel to act as a wife toward Him. We need to keep this point in mind as we read the book of Judges. </p>
<p data-content-id="xe7avABozG70p9uBQKrkWtRZCXkNG-rzxLfyGIrRSU2oxZpMKT6aYtUfpcnboZH-c"> In writing the books of history, Samuel put Judges after Joshua to show us what kind of life Israel lived toward her Husband. For some reason, she did not have a heart to be the wife of Jehovah. As a wife, she forgot her Husband, left her Husband, and acted according to her own desires. Eventually, Israel became a harlot. At the time of Hosea, Israel was a harlot in the eyes of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43595" data-verses="Hosea 1:2">Hosea 1:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43596" data-verses="Hosea 2:2">2:2</span>). Having fallen into the sin of adultery, she did not have a definite husband. In addition to Jehovah as her Husband, she had many other men. This was the situation of Israel in the book of Judges. In the book of Judges there is a terrible picture of a wife forsaking her Husband and not even acknowledging His existence. This is an ugly picture of a harlot, a wife who forsook her Husband and went after idols. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZttMCIwPSysx8XGslxwvtaQROoLwkkaWmDR7SI5qIslWDzBmBBP1xJAAI8cCMLy3"> In the beginning Israel had a bridal love toward God, but after her marriage she lost her position as a chaste wife to her husband. She forsook God and went to idols. Every idol was a “man,” and Israel became full of idols. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43597" data-verses="Jeremiah 11:13">Jeremiah 11:13 </span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> says that according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem the people had set up altars to burn incense to their idols. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43598" data-verses="Ezekiel 16:24">Ezekiel 16:24</span> tells us that Israel made “a high place in every street.” This means that there was an idol on every street. This corresponds to the New Testament, which shows us another great harlot in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43599" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">Revelation 17</span>, the Roman Catholic Church, which is the mother of many harlots. Since the mother of the harlots is the apostate Roman Church, the harlots, the daughters of the apostate church, must be all the sects and groups in Christianity that hold to some extent the teachings, practices, and traditions of the apostate Roman Church. </p>
<p data-content-id="dCgappIZMitA0WaTAoYEhZ9XltOtY1rxDrIqwogCeHKXFvOpWAHJxb6i-o7WdN0du"> In the book of Judges, a particular saying is repeated a number of times: “In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did that which was right in his own eyes” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43600" data-verses="Judges 17:6">17:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43601" data-verses="Judges 18:1">18:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43602" data-verses="Judges 19:1">19:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43603" data-verses="Judges 21:25">21:25</span>). But God was the King! According to the principle in the Bible, the husband is the head of the marriage and the head of the family. In creation God ordained that the man would have this authority; therefore, he also has the kingship. In typology and in figure, God is the unique man. We all are females because we, the church, are the corporate wife to Christ. Since God is our Creator and our Lord, He should also be our King. </p>
<p data-content-id="h-dqb2psHYuYHxK9ARbozkf40hOMLOPkkP_40LthBDaFixSxO8X_EvhA-NsuWw_IW"> When Israel said that there was no king among them, this meant that they had annulled God and His status. In the book of 1 Samuel, the children of Israel asked God to appoint a king for them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43604" data-verses="1Samuel 8:5">8:5</span>). This was a great offense to God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43605" data-verses="1Samuel 8:7">v. 7</span>). Even though Israel was a wife to God, she became a harlot. She did not recognize God’s kingship, and she did not recognize God as her Husband. Therefore, the children of Israel did what was right in their own eyes, and as a result they became rotten and corrupted. </p>
<p data-content-id="UtP7uxI4Sur-QfpLtgtaWTzJpW8QJeQ1tImtxbUSjyBFtVj58EdQBH-1LDSVAgeUE"> This is what we see in the book of Judges. The history in this book is thus a history of rottenness. After the story of Judah and Caleb in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43606" data-verses="Judges 1:1-20">1:1-20</span>, Israel’s history as recorded in Judges was full of the rottenness and corruption of a harlot. This is the intrinsic significance of the book of Judges. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mq0TIfQ9ZywEhRBPWrX9u6qVJmE1jGiQCi6mKbtets435U7hrQmNG8EmXrgsoP1k0"> I would now like to give a brief introductory word to our study of Judges. <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> </p>

Before we come to these verses, I would like to say a word concerning the intrinsic significance of this portion of the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="h-dqb2psHYuYHxK9ARboxkfd-hOMLOPkkP_40LthBDaFixSxO8X_EvhA-NsuWw_IW"> We have seen that at Mount Sinai God entered into a marriage union with Israel and that He wanted her to remain in the most intimate contact with Him in this marvelous marriage union. But Israel rejected God as her Husband and as her King and “went about as harlots after other gods and worshipped them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43646" data-verses="Judges 2:17">2:17</span>). In dealing with this situation, the King became a servant, as the Angel of Jehovah, to admonish the children of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43647" data-verses="Judges 2:1-5">vv. 1-5</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="UtP7uxI4Sur-QfpLtgtaUTzoiW8QJeQ1tImtxbUSjyBFtVj58EdQBH-1LDSVAgeUE"> The Angel of Jehovah is spoken of throughout the Old Testament, from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43648" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span> through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43649" data-verses="Zechariah 3:1">Zechariah 3</span>. The Angel of Jehovah is also mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43650" data-verses="Judges 2:1">Judges 2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43651" data-verses="Judges 6:1">6</span>. The word <em>angel</em> is capitalized in these instances because this Angel is a particular Angel. The Angel of Jehovah is just God Himself in His Divine Trinity serving His elect as a Servant. </p>
<p data-content-id="TeQXT2hG6aDSz2UrP3G1uggOcsjSTughewQXMWtBOvDOPrWNBDAfwkcS8m5cAT8pg"> When Moses was being called by God to lead Israel out of Egypt, the calling Jehovah became the Angel of Jehovah. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43652" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span> the names <em>Jehovah</em> and <em>the Angel of Jehovah</em> are used interchangeably (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43653" data-verses="Exodus 3:2">vv. 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43654" data-verses="Exodus 3:4">4</span>). The embodiment of the Triune God is Christ, and Christ is the Angel of Jehovah, who took care of Israel as the acting Jehovah in the Old Testament. Christ is the acting God, not a silent, passive God. For Christ to be the Angel of Jehovah means that God has appointed and <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> commissioned Himself in His Divine Trinity to act in caring for His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="nxSib6kjtVkTe7kyBPe7QOD7UVj5vhEJ3KtmuhrvilHFkCZiNgXpm1wWl-OTy9IFB"> Because Israel did not act as a proper wife, the very Jehovah who was the Husband, the Head, and the King of Israel became a Servant to His wife. This means that He did not come to her as a Husband, Head, or King but came to her as the Angel of Jehovah, who was sent by Jehovah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43655" data-verses="Zechariah 2:9-11">Zech. 2:9-11</span>). Since Israel did not consider Jehovah as the Head, He became a Servant to serve her. His admonition in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43656" data-verses="Judges 2:1">Judges 2</span> was the admonition of a servant. </p>
<p data-content-id="6PMx9iFR8J78oPoa1gQS4FwutbmLZvjDzz4bNjGMdtLX1pffY1lRZDrXTSG8Zc2K0"> With respect to Christ as the Angel of Jehovah, let us review what is revealed concerning Christ in the four Gospels. In the Gospel of Matthew Christ is presented as the King, and in the Gospel of Mark the King is presented as a Slave. The King-Savior thus became a Slave-Savior. In the Gospel of Luke the Slave-Savior is presented as a Man-Savior in His human virtues with the divine attributes. However, He is more than just a man; He is also God. Therefore, in the Gospel of John He is presented as God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43657" data-verses="John 1:1">1:1</span>). He is the eternal God who became flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43658" data-verses="John 1:14">v. 14</span>). Our Savior, therefore, is a God-man, who is both a King and a Slave. This is the intrinsic significance of the four Gospels. </p>
<p data-content-id="RKU3JHmcHgEtaqRx5V2CM5QG1x6Nslx1Eb_m8JbFr6cX5kIt-pj4QgyBwQKZl9JMR"> Our God wants to save us and be our King, and we need to acknowledge Him as our Head and King. In order to save us, however, the King had to become a Servant and a Slave. As a Slave He is both God and man. He is a man, but His substance, His very essence, is God. </p>
<p data-content-id="sDfyxj46G4iDGhi3-IQkeN35GUTDAc--gYkAEIiSGUeJGWJL30wHmjXSPmRfLpjCG"> In His divinity God is our King and Head. Because our situation was so poor, the King had to become a Servant to serve us. The Servant sent by God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43659" data-verses="Judges 2:1">Judges 2</span> was actually Jehovah Himself in His acting situation. He did not come to rebuke or command; rather, He came to admonish and to take care of Israel. This is the significance of the Angel of Jehovah in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43660" data-verses="Judges 2:1">Judges 2</span>. </p>

Second, He reminded them of Jehovah’s faithfulness in keeping His promise to them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43668" data-verses="Judges 2:1">v. 1b</span>).

<p data-content-id="6PMx9iFR8J78oPoa1gQS_FwLlbmLZvjDzz4bNjGMdtLX1pffY1lRZDrXTSG8Zc2K0"> Prior to the history recorded in these chapters, the people of Israel had never had a female leader. Then, suddenly, God raised up a female, Deborah, as a judge of Israel. Regarding this, we need to realize that in the Bible, whenever God does something which stands out as being extraordinary, it is very significant. It indicates, first, man’s failure, and then, God’s excellent act. At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43693" data-verses="Judges 4:1">Judges 4</span>, all the men of Israel had failed, so God raised up a woman. That raising up of a female changed the entire condition of Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="RKU3JHmcHgEtaqRx5V2CL5Qn8x6Nslx1Eb_m8JbFr6cX5kIt-pj4QgyBwQKZl9JMR"> In the Bible a proper female indicates one who is in submission to God, one who keeps God’s ordination. This is the position that Israel should have taken before God, but the situation in Israel had become fully abnormal. The men had left their position before Jehovah. Hence, Israel violated God’s ordination, leaving her position as God’s wife and forsaking Him for hundreds of idols. This brought Israel into a miserable situation and condition. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZttMCIwPSysx8XGslxwqta1bOoLwkkaWmDR7SI5qIslWDzBmBBP1xJAAI8cCMLy3"> According to God’s creation, Deborah was a very capable person. By reading her song in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43694" data-verses="Judges 5:1">chapter five</span>, we can see that she was full of ability, capacity, insight, and foresight. But <span class="pg" data-page-id="16" id="16">[16]</span> such an excellent person was very submissive. God made her the leader, yet she kept the proper order and took Barak as her covering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43695" data-verses="Judges 4:6-9">4:6-9</span>). She realized that she needed a man to be her covering. Actually, Barak did nearly nothing, yet Deborah took him as her “head covering.” When she took this kind of standing, the whole nation became different. In their miserable situation no one would take the lead to fight for Jehovah’s interest, and no one would be willing to follow. But when this excellent, extraordinary woman took the lead to practice the female submission to the man, the entire country came into the proper order. Everyone returned to his or her proper position. Thus Deborah could say in her song, “Then a remnant of the nobles went down; / The people of Jehovah went down with me against the mighty” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43696" data-verses="Judges 5:13">5:13</span>). All the leaders took the lead, and all the people followed; the army was formed. At first, only some of the people followed, but eventually they all followed. From this we see that the entire country came into an excellent order, assuming the proper position before Jehovah. </p>
<p data-content-id="dCgappIZMitA0WaTAoYEkZ92utOtY1rxDrIqwogCeHKXFvOpWAHJxb6i-o7WdN0du"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43697" data-verses="Judges 5:15-16">Judges 5:15-16</span> speaks of “great resolutions in heart” and “great searchings of heart.” In Israel’s miserable situation, no one was searching his heart. But the people needed a great searching of their hearts, and they needed to make great resolutions in their hearts to rise up and follow the others to fight for God’s kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="Q8cauZ6QxrnW0tAvjeFY_VKWtCzymo_AVIqZYTF1O4IgKdfJ6SLxCe5LSLGy9UsC1"> We may apply this to our practice of the vital groups today. For the vital groups we need much prayer with repentance. In our prayer spontaneously the searching of the heart comes to us. This issues in a resolve to live for the Lord and to fight for the Lord according to the present need in His recovery. In particular, we need to make a resolution before the Lord concerning gaining persons for His increase. This is “great resolutions in heart.” </p>
<p data-content-id="K33FnjBYfPCTwI0raBj1W__S8WzEE-pIgUM8DbDlpg_WvTkuOzJcbYh4muNLRTMNs"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43698" data-verses="Judges 3:12-13">Judges 3:12-13</span> says that Jehovah strengthened Israel’s enemies, but <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43699" data-verses="Judges 4:6-16">4:6-16</span> reveals that Jehovah was fighting for Israel. This shows that God is a God of incarnation. God wants man to match Him so that He can move. If Israel had not fought, God would not have fought for them. However, because Israel did fight under Deborah in a proper order, God <span class="pg" data-page-id="17" id="17">[17]</span> fought for them. The principle is the same with us today. If we do not go out to gain sinners, God will not go, but if we go, God also will go. However, this kind of going out needs a searching of our heart and a resolution in our heart. God will not work until we become active in this searching of our heart and making resolutions in our heart. This is the way to fight the battle; this is the way to preach the gospel; and this is the way to gain sinners to become members of Christ. </p>

We need the searchings, the resolutions, and the rising up to shine like the sun. If all the churches would be like this, they surely would enjoy the victory. May all the dear saints in the Lord’s recovery have great searchings and make great resolutions, and may they all, by loving the Lord, rise up like the sun to shine brightly. </p>

<p data-content-id="PMCRcwbc5i8QfvmwpVxcjHO2-x44nhfdoIXPvlaBdOYrtcApnaBCf1WZ1ZAmFrapn"> Gideon, a marvelous judge who was called by Jehovah in a very particular way, was successful because of four things. First, he listened carefully to the word of God, something that was rare among the children of Israel at that time. Second, Gideon obeyed God’s word and acted on it. Third, he tore down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43744" data-verses="Judges 6:25-28">6:25-28</span>). This touched God’s heart. In the degradation of Israel, God hated the idols to the uttermost. God as the genuine Husband regarded all the idols as men with whom His wife Israel had committed harlotry. Fourth, by tearing down the altar of Baal and cutting down the Asherah that belonged to his father, Gideon sacrificed his relationship with his father and his enjoyment of society. Because of what he had done, the men of the city of Ophrah contended with him and even wanted to kill him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43745" data-verses="Judges 6:28-30">vv. 28-30</span>). For Gideon to do such a thing for God required that he sacrifice his own interests, and his sacrifice was a strong factor of his success. </p>
<p data-content-id="-oSnLi8aVaNPts3-e4elFioudwbfb4xcHb-Ypq-d-vrPNgM-drFewwpXMPE6kJXTH"> The selection of the three hundred in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43746" data-verses="Judges 7:2-7">7:2-7</span> also stresses the sacrifice of our personal interests and enjoyment for <span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> God’s purpose. When Gideon blew the trumpet to call the people to fight against the Midianites, thirty-two thousand responded. God said that those who were with Gideon were too many for God to deliver Midian into their hand, for Israel might have vaunted himself against God, saying, “My own hand has saved me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43747" data-verses="Judges 7:2">v. 2</span>). By telling Gideon that he had too many people, God was indicating that He would fight for them. First, twenty-two thousand went home because they were afraid (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43748" data-verses="Judges 7:3">v. 3</span>). Then Jehovah tested the remaining ten thousand by bringing them to the water to drink. Those who bowed down on their knees and lapped as a dog laps were sent home (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43749" data-verses="Judges 7:5">v. 5</span>). Only the three hundred who lapped the water into their mouths with their hands were chosen by God for the battle against Midian (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43750" data-verses="Judges 7:6">v. 6</span>). Jehovah told Gideon that through the three hundred men who lapped in that way, He would save them from Midian. Like Gideon, these three hundred were willing to sacrifice in order to be used by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Z4Mf6qXIvIv1m166u4mH5rlmx-z2eMZWdtMRnaUtbuhi0lgQkOFRl49eOWTU3xTG4"> As a result of these four factors, Gideon received a reward: the economical Spirit came upon him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43751" data-verses="Judges 6:34">6:34</span>). Hence, he became powerful and with only three hundred men defeated two princes and two kings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43752" data-verses="Judges 7:25">7:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43753" data-verses="Judges 8:10-12">8:10-12</span>). With Gideon we have a picture of a man in union with God, a God-man, to fulfill God’s word and to carry out God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="A8sv42RWuKph-QGAN9I8U4AS-CF4bIYkW-IybCmIucwDy8YgPzBPwhi7Q-8f4FuMX"> After his great success—the greatest success in all the cycles of Israel’s history recorded in Judges—Gideon had a terrible failure. The secret of his failure comprises three factors. First, Gideon was not kind. He killed those countrymen who did not support him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43754" data-verses="Judges 8:16-17">vv. 16-17</span>), breaking the sixth commandment of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43755" data-verses="Exodus 20:13">Exo. 20:13</span>). Second, he indulged in the lust of the flesh, not exercising any restriction over his fleshly lust. This is indicated by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43756" data-verses="Judges 8:30">Judges 8:30</span>, which tells us that Gideon had seventy sons, “for he had many wives.” In addition, his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43757" data-verses="Judges 8:31">v. 31</span>). By this Gideon broke the seventh commandment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43758" data-verses="Exodus 20:14">Exo. 20:14</span>). Third, although he did a good thing in refusing to rule over the people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43759" data-verses="Judges 8:22-23">Judg. 8:22-23</span>), he coveted the spoil of his people, and they surrendered it to him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43760" data-verses="Judges 8:24">v. 24</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="FtPXQCEVjXPFahl-bL3l7zh7N89vBcPuqcj3P1Bhtk3XIWUUWFN64pqDxaH0NnePP"> Gideon’s indulgence in sex and his greediness for gold led to idolatry. Greediness is idolatry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43761" data-verses="Colossians 3:5">Col. 3:5</span>), and both <span class="pg" data-page-id="25" id="25">[25]</span> fornication and greediness are linked to idol worship (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43762" data-verses="Ephesians 5:5">Eph. 5:5</span>). Even King Solomon, who began as a God-fearing and God-loving person, eventually became an idol worshipper through his many foreign wives (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43763" data-verses="1Kings 11:4">1 Kings 11:4</span>). Gideon made an ephod with the gold he had taken from the people, and this ephod became an idol to the children of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43764" data-verses="Judges 8:27">Judg. 8:27</span>). As a result, Gideon’s family and the entire society of Israel were corrupted. Gideon began by tearing down the altar of Baal and its idol, but after his success he built something idolatrous. This failure canceled all his success. </p>
<p data-content-id="Cb-gv6syJJJgqp1-zWEY03fK78kR94gCBUq0o8G2LG_exS2To02oLXOHTmFYLO5gn"> Judges is a book concerning the enjoyment of the good land, which is a type of Christ. Gideon’s success indicates the gaining of an excellent opportunity to enjoy Christ, but his failure indicates the losing of the opportunity to enjoy Christ. His failure shows us that we need to exercise strict control in dealing with the matters of sex and wealth. Otherwise, we will suffer the loss of the enjoyment of Christ. Any indulgence in these things will cause our enjoyment of Christ to be annulled. </p>

This means that Israel divorced God, her legitimate Husband, and went after many idols. </p>
<p data-content-id="XnaltEoTBf293XmaRPg4EuTbPnuvnzrZa-Lmn2f_tyqY0QxrWQusknvQf1kK-Mifo"> Man’s forsaking of God began in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43822" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>. God created man with a spirit so that man could contact Him, receive Him, and take Him in as life. The tree of life in the garden signified God Himself as the embodiment of life for us to contact and receive. God warned man not to partake of the other tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for eating of the fruit of that tree would issue in death. However, from the beginning of man’s existence, Satan has been seducing man to take of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which is the embodiment of Satan himself. To take the tree of knowledge is actually to marry Satan and divorce God. </p>
<p data-content-id="k2NB8NVqcSSjdGprwOUl6kYCgx2ymvQov3bAWJzcILSesZxXWfUMnKI4AZoeUNgPD"> This forsaking of God and joining to Satan is the strongest factor behind the chaos in human society. Due to man’s forsaking of God and joining to Satan, the entire world, including every nation, society, and family, has become chaotic. Immediately after man forsook God and joined himself to Satan, chaos came in. The first manifestation of <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> this chaos was the first murder, which took place in Adam’s family when Cain slew Abel. From that time onward, there has been chaos in every nation, society, and family. </p>
<p data-content-id="3WB_gI5vc4M-ZofJFi5NjsfStTK6agmDhTy8NhR9Ww8nDQB4nYYEmBSx-DTW7_-en"> Gideon’s failure was due to his forsaking of God and his joining himself to Satan. In his success he was joined to God, but in his failure he joined himself to Satan. When he joined himself to Satan, the issue was murder. He also indulged in the flesh, coveted, and committed idolatry. This issued in the corruption of his family and the entire society of Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="G8LR2B1hND6_Tp4ocudZy9MoIS86PqQ9tjyopfOVnJj7r4u4hMeMi7jaGpwGG_XWe"> Even religion is part of the universal chaos. The world spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43823" data-verses="Galatians 6:14">Galatians 6:14</span> is not the secular world but the religious world. Christ died to save us from the religious world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43824" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">1:4</span>). In man’s eyes religion is good, but in God’s eyes every kind of religion is a section of the satanic world. In principle, the situation in today’s Christianity is the same as the universal situation of the human race—it has forsaken God and joined itself to Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="cfF8xcC9b2DuETwQuCBn9-BFowetuzUNP_82w2RZiNDIEc40b16z_ohSM5z4xECp3"> We have also had periods of chaos in the Lord’s recovery. It seems that in the recovery there are cycles of rebellion about every ten years, involving struggles for power to fulfill ambitions. The recent rebellion among us had two roots—unforgiven offenses and unfulfilled ambitions. The intrinsic significance of all these rebellions is forsaking God to go along with Satan. Satan fell because of ambition. To go along with Satan is to enter into the ambition that was present in Satan when he fell. He wanted to ascend to the throne; he wanted to be like the Most High (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43825" data-verses="Isaiah 14:13-14">Isa. 14:13-14</span>). Hence, to forsake God and join with Satan is to enter into the intrinsic ambition within this evil one. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y1XNvL-TYUcrUK1Kyt_Q15-kmAIQkg1IWvSdSBSxq3ylwIhAsYPJNWZjNPlG4dG4u"> The result of rebellion has always been chaos, with the rebellious ones causing damage to themselves. The churches that joined the recent rebellion have become barren and have even decreased in number, while the remaining churches have increased. </p>

But once a husband or wife begins to <span class="pg" data-page-id="35" id="35">[35]</span> love something else in place of the Lord, their married life and family life become chaotic. </p>
<p data-content-id="DJiVvBpxKMkP5Wz2_Z_tFK7vhSu3q_NrW6uO6T78xmPhXQ6WuwygobpNN8yixomfT"> We have no right to divorce the Lord; we have no basis to forsake Him.

<p data-content-id="SCcBB0LWBkrUEZAmPjilncDB_GUeFHww4mAfmnmJoawJ1yp00OfqM7RlG1OP1Jyhx"> This principle can be applied to the entire human race, to every nation, to every society, to every family, and to every individual.

<p data-content-id="mmYKWk9uhwZTSkgqy0fezdzhlPK1fyWArBvQaejprJ5IBxaGr0RvN-uIz8aqk6SYV"> After considering <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43843" data-verses="Judges 9:1">chapter nine</span> of Judges, we can see that it presents to us a picture of what a mess God’s elect Israel had become and to what extent they had degraded. Their degradation was initiated in their forsaking of Jehovah their God and their worshipping of the idols of the Canaanites, which issued in their indulgence in fleshly lust by having many wives to produce many sons. Gideon produced seventy-two sons of many wives (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43844" data-verses="Judges 8:30-31">8:30-31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43845" data-verses="Judges 9:5">9:5</span>); another judge produced thirty sons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43846" data-verses="Judges 10:4">10:4</span>); another judge produced thirty sons and thirty daughters (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43847" data-verses="Judges 12:8-9">12:8-9</span>); and another judge produced forty sons and thirty grandsons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43848" data-verses="Judges 12:13-14">vv. 13-14</span>). Israel’s degradation also issued in the wantonness of their hatred in slaying one another, ending themselves in full destruction. </p>

<p data-content-id="0GB6W_rvLz_MDsR7iAUbQESCeSTzGxSQgjHyrov8l672zbX--HPZspE-jpFqi3iXd"> I have the burden to speak further concerning forsaking God and being joined to Satan. This matter is fully revealed and recorded in the Scriptures. The first man was poisoned by this, and the first family was devastated by this. Ever since the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43851" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>, man has been forsaking God and joining to Satan, taking many things as replacements of God. In his fourteen Epistles, Paul ministered the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ, but he also dealt with all kinds of replacements of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="72cn0jRyI8FVhW9wCmTAI7lB0TNYKDPwx-m-3IL_TGcCQQGDEnoBJAkqv0_WqHQXt"> The book of Judges shows us how degraded and corrupt Israel had become. It is hard to imagine that the children of Israel, who had been chosen, taught, trained, and disciplined by God and who had God’s law, could have become so rotten. Their degradation began with their forsaking of God and their worshipping of idols, and it issued in their indulgence in fleshly lust and in wanton self-destruction. Samson, the last judge mentioned in this book, was very powerful, yet the factor of his failure was his indulgence in sex. At the end of Judges, there is an account of wanton slaughter, describing how the entire tribe of Benjamin was nearly extinguished by Israel. The factor that led to this degradation was that they forsook God to the uttermost and turned to idols. Here we see that idol worship is closely linked to fornication and <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> murder. If someone becomes an idol worshipper, he will become a person who is very indulgent in sex and full of hatred toward others. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PvEYsXiFmZwXDUmG4C1amfBaOE2cbndJ8aWw0cKC93htOGdUbpk63Zumr3auvyar"> I have been serving the Lord for nearly sixty-one years and have had much consideration concerning these matters. My realization is that all the sins, all the evils, all the iniquities, come out of one source—forsaking God and joining to something which becomes a replacement of God. This is true even in small things. For example, a sister’s combing of her hair can be an idol. If a sister pays too much attention to her hair, honoring it excessively, that kind of honor is a worship. Such a sister may not have time in the morning to spend ten minutes with the Lord, but she has plenty of time to comb her hair. The sisters may need to check with the Lord regarding this, saying, “Lord, is the way I care for my hair a replacement of You?” If a sister checks with the Lord in this way, the Lord will tell her, her conscience will tell her, and her intuition in her spirit will also tell her. </p>
<p data-content-id="WRUTSKS_BgIlJSEUSJJjTbfwOkozUAEusyOuwu3pnCaqRXmgEYWdns2dsg_87fCxA"> In recent years, certain ones left us and formed divisions. It seems that the leaders among them are doing nothing but traveling from place to place in order to create and strengthen such divisions. Division has become a thing that motivates and energizes them. The goal of their activity is to separate the saints from the enjoyment of the New Testament ministry. Their intention is to poison the saints in order to deaden them, cool them down, and cause them to have doubts about the Lord’s recovery. The main factor with these ones is that they have left the church and joined themselves to the “demon” of division. </p>
<p data-content-id="2cejvqkXlqIq3XkiO1HIi2dt66ix9AYVTLogcAYUNXI0V8lJUUSOySQgvZ1QI41Yo"> I have published a book called <em>The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion,</em> presenting the whole story, fully documented. That book concludes by saying that we need to “reject any kind of division (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43852" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:10">1 Cor. 1:10</span>), to stand against any wind of teaching and any spreading of spiritual death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43853" data-verses="Ephesians 4:14">Eph. 4:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43854" data-verses="2Timothy 2:16-17">2 Tim. 2:16-17</span>), and to separate ourselves from the contagious ones—exercising to quarantine” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43855" data-verses="Titus 3:10">Titus 3:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43856" data-verses="Romans 16:17">Rom. 16:17</span>). Some, however, have not agreed to quarantine these ones and have embraced division. They have been deceived to such an extent that they take the matter of division as an idol. <span class="pg" data-page-id="41" id="41">[41]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="u2tvkwgNrjnidnnX_MNNw7YjoaMJMVixguQUEJzMcS9EN3GNv7NjIRXHTpfzdze_t"> In our spiritual life, even to take a small thing, such as combing our hair or buying something, may be to take another husband. To some extent, this is to forsake Christ. Even in holding a thought preferring this or that thing, our preference can become an idol. You may say that you are still with the Lord, but you may be with the Lord in a general way, but particularly, in a certain thing, you may not be with the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="fgzcKCY2aruNABZY3MGojZAmLV5_uNEGf8gETvO_mTDjhDjz5Cp0KPf0kPX7W9oq7"> God’s Spirit is indwelling us and is speaking to us all the time. Sometimes I would like to speak something to my wife, even something spiritual, but someone within is saying, “Don’t talk.” To take my preference to speak that thing would be to make that thing an idol and would bring me into chaos. But to obey the inner speaking is to hold to our one Lord, one Master, one Head, one Husband. </p>

In reading through these cycles in Judges, it is difficult to understand how someone as positive as Gideon could become so negative. Between his success and his failure, it must have been that a demon entered him, because he forsook God and joined himself to Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="4ffSkbjzmvUXguEpQQy5H7QHlVW28wh4JA39Cs9r-HnroCff3QuoRpry-ZPRjqYEa"> This principle can be seen even more in the case of Samson. His birth was a miracle initiated by the appearing of the Angel of Jehovah. When Samson was in the bosom of his mother, he was sanctified to be a Nazarite. As he grew up, he was clean and pure according to God’s ordination, and he was empowered by the Spirit of God. When the Israelites were under the tyranny of the Philistines, the Spirit of God as the holy, economical Spirit came upon Samson, and he became powerful. </p>
<p data-content-id="o0JHFTPvFit-v63NpzoBSUiHPMjq0w9AG83rMzNA3dWCcqStLf_iesDi-VQXFXEP-"> However, Samson’s unique problem was in the matter of sex. He was not genuine in seeking for a spouse; rather, his contacting of women was just to indulge his lusts. He indulged his lust with a Philistine woman, with a harlot in Gaza, and with a woman named Delilah. Although he had been empowered by God, he was damaged and destroyed to the uttermost because of his indulgence in lust. <span class="pg" data-page-id="46" id="46">[46]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="efI6V2igVjD5ZFx-5o8ITT-ZF9UAUhw9YmZsclY71LeMnxwhZkMDIpVTXeBqdVJ4b"> Shortly after I decided to give up my job and serve the Lord, I went to Shanghai to see Brother Nee. He told me that in serving the Lord the brothers must learn the principle of not contacting a female, especially a young one, in private.

<p data-content-id="5K_v4MS6KmOwT4MZmjfiyVD9_g5VXkT9IfJu4TGgzGLK4oEXBymsEuNeCtdJHnRtX"> The sisters should clothe and cover their body in a proper way. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43880" data-verses="1Timothy 2:9">First Timothy 2:9</span> charges the sisters to “adorn themselves in proper clothing with modesty and sobriety, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly clothing.” The word <em>proper</em> denotes fitting to the sisters’ nature and position as saints of God. In Greek the word for <em>clothing</em> implies deportment, demeanor. A sister’s demeanor, of which clothing is the main sign, must befit her saintly position. The word <em>modesty</em> means, literally, “shamefastness,” denoting being bound or made fast by an honorable shame (Vincent), implying not forward or overbold but moderate, observing the proprieties of womanhood. The word <em>sobriety</em> means “sobermindedness, self-restraint; the restricting of oneself soberly and discreetly.” The sisters in a local church should clothe themselves with these two virtues—shamefastness and self-restraint—as their demeanor. </p>
<p data-content-id="NfU2WnCjN2DFg8aNB8ajad6D9JxFgLLmRKwzMV1h2v7uUG4nzmIZa3l2ncNNihp8J"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43881" data-verses="Hebrews 13:4">Hebrews 13:4</span> says, “Let marriage be held in honor among all,” because through marriage mankind continues to exist on earth and is propagated to replenish the earth. God created a need and desire within man to be married. A desire to be married is not sinful; on the contrary, it is according to God’s ordination. However, the time to consider marriage is after graduation from college. All the brothers and sisters should consecrate to the Lord, giving themselves to Him and promising that they will live for Him and even live Him their entire life. Then they should pray to see if there is the leading of the Lord in this matter, rather than trying to be too selective. Keeping these items will be a great protection to the young people. </p>

The history contained in these books is a great type that shows how God’s elect can gain and enjoy the good land, which is a complete and all-inclusive type of Christ. Even the small details show us the secret of gaining and enjoying Christ, just as in our daily life something as small as shopping for an article of clothing can be a factor in whether or not we obtain Christ and enjoy Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="efI6V2igVjD5ZFx-5o8IST-8P9UAUhw9YmZsclY71LeMnxwhZkMDIpVTXeBqdVJ4b"> When we were saved, we were brought into a fellowship of the Divine Trinity with His redeemed and regenerated people. From that time God and we have been in a fellowship. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43921" data-verses="1John 1:3">First John 1:3</span> says, “That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.” This fellowship is between the apostles and God and between the believers and the apostles. The full salvation of God is in this fellowship. It is in this fellowship that we can gain what God has given us, that is, the Son of God given to us by God as our allotted portion. </p>
<p data-content-id="5K_v4MS6KmOwT4MZmjfizVDc0g5VXkT9IfJu4TGgzGLK4oEXBymsEuNeCtdJHnRtX"> If we remain in this fellowship, we will have the way to gain and enjoy Christ. If our fellowship with God is cut off, we will lose our enjoyment immediately. Concerning this, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="52" id="52">[52]</span> Lord Jesus uses the word <em>abide</em> and speaks of our abiding in Him as the vine (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43922" data-verses="John 15:4">John 15:4</span>). The vine is a figure of the all-inclusive Christ under God’s cultivation. As long as the branch abides in the vine, there is fellowship. But once a branch ceases to abide in the vine, the branch is cut off, becomes barren and dry, and loses the enjoyment of the riches of the vine (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43923" data-verses="John 15:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="J7bgv3-zGyPI1wmQRrtHn9qEL1gxXT7qf0sGadTc4dw8584NldHK8JXhJpRqEZDIh"> The fellowship of life is not a rough matter but is very fine. Even a little word spoken with an improper attitude is enough to cut us off from the fellowship of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="ziMzj2zKx8nG4ltuNOgTzTrRxnPpA7HWxTHkoEY1utDO2FlnHVvAYc8BtDTR6j5K1"> Our enjoyment of Christ is essential. Our fellowship can speed up the turning of the great wheel of God’s move in the universe. But if we are cut off from the fellowship just a little, God’s economy will not be able to go forward for a period of time. Therefore, we need to be careful every day and in every detail, keeping ourselves in the enjoyment of Christ all the time. Then God’s economy will be able to go forward. </p>
<p data-content-id="a8uCRm3gKlUYbAA3hoxKQ6lygsl2oOgJ_edNmhVxo7k3rZpdSapyrjnGATwbr2zSx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43924" data-verses="Revelation 22:20">Revelation 22:20</span> the Lord Jesus said, “I come quickly,” but today there is no sign that He is coming, because the wheel has not had an adequate opportunity to turn. If the saints in the Lord’s recovery take care of all the items of the intrinsic significances of the books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, the Lord will be able to come back much sooner. However, doing things without taking care of the inner feeling, the sense of life within, may delay the Lord for a long time. </p>
<p data-content-id="bvzhb1P1y1Hzf-wp44L4xy_JdlFQ6x0sOGC374MOdSiFiajBpYXdzdJp0HpcU_skR"> The rebellion that took place in 1959-1965 in Taiwan delayed the Lord very much. When we began the ministry there in 1949, we increased nearly a hundred-fold in just a few years. Since the rebellion the rate of increase has never been the same. The recent rebellion in the recovery has also delayed the Lord and, in certain respects, hindered the move of the wheel of God’s economy. For this reason, I have been stressing the intrinsic significances in Joshua and Judges. I have been doing this not only to show that God has given us Christ as the good land but also to show how we can possess and enjoy this land for generations to come. </p>

<p data-content-id="yvygQFstrwKJ4UlYkS2g-Y6XNq3oh4J3lHxffcn2ZXFzZ1tCR85l_tE-JeL303XUQ"> At this juncture, let us consider the situation of Israel as it is presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43925" data-verses="Judges 17:1-2">Judges 17 and 18</span>. In their degradation Israel became chaotic in three ways: in government, in worship, and in morality. They had no government, no administration. God’s tabernacle was at Shiloh, and the high priest had the Urim and Thummim, but there was no administration. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43926" data-verses="Judges 17:1-2">Judges 17 and 18</span> reveal the abominable chaos in the children of Israel’s worship. Micah set up a house of gods in his home. His mother consecrated silver to Jehovah to make an idol and a molten image. Micah then set up a house of gods, made an ephod and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons to be his priest. The ephod signifies the authority of God, without which no one can worship God. Later, Micah consecrated a Levite to be his house priest, paying him a salary of ten pieces of silver a year plus an array of clothing and his food. In those days the Danites robbed Micah of his idol, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image with his priest, and with them they set up another worship place in the city of Dan, while God’s tabernacle remained in Shiloh. The result was two worship centers—the proper one with God’s tabernacle at Shiloh and the improper one in Dan. That was the chaos of the children of Israel in their worship. </p>
<p data-content-id="8-Fe4WG0zdXVoTRGrHMCy0PfCxzdWPReTiys9FB9VQ7xsUHoSt11EOUVtRw0rzuAC"> We may apply this picture to the present situation of Christianity. Today’s Christianity has many “houses of Micah,” the most prominent of which is the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church has set up idols, made its own “ephod,” and set up its own priests. According to the New Testament all those who are born of God should be priests (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43927" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">1 Pet. 2:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43928" data-verses="1Peter 2:9">9</span>), but Catholicism has hired its own priests and set up a hierarchy under a pope. In principle, Catholicism is the same as the house of Micah in Judges. The state churches, the denominations, and many of the independent groups are also houses of Micah, full of idols as replacements of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="0GB6W_rvLz_MDsR7iAUbeESbTSTzGxSQgjHyrov8l672zbX--HPZspE-jpFqi3iXd"> Not everything in Christianity is wrong, but everything is a mixture.

<p data-content-id="9eah38sKhajVtOxYAE_1XJXsQn1YjPebMQDKgN4QjVMJ798dMl7g_LpQYhfkwChaP"> Any teaching or practice among Christians that is not according to the Scriptures is an idol. In the recent rebellion among us, a teaching regarding autonomy was promoted. Those who teach this stress that every local church is absolutely autonomous. However, this is contrary to the Scriptures and produces local sects. This teaching has become an idol. </p>
<p data-content-id="jpACkdSMEqDyq6VssmVinUuKeBtj4GJaTMR2aOLJNgw9ekwFjOISbsuT4xJrEhIjn"> In the United States every state is autonomous in business affairs, but the fifty states are not fifty different nations. On the contrary, there are fifty states but one nation. Likewise, each local church is autonomous in its business affairs, but the teaching that each local church is absolutely autonomous in every way within its locality is an idol. Nevertheless, some are using this teaching to spread division. </p>
<p data-content-id="iBEtHfQKwRTsTWpf9dzDYUdQ0ZjQnqlESc3Xsa-KcxZ81uLPZ2aR1KJ1uESKGAVPb"> Every item in the Lord’s recovery must be according to the Bible. For example, calling on the name of the Lord and pray-reading are scriptural practices (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43962" data-verses="Genesis 4:26">Gen. 4:26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43963" data-verses="Genesis 13:4">13:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43964" data-verses="Ephesians 6:17-18">Eph. 6:17-18</span>).

<p data-content-id="1K6YO9zQ0KTOlkuFuC1j4oynuBAvrtNQ8udLwFzK8My_YoriCmnGNjG6-w7mbO7p2"> The difference between the churches in the Lord’s recovery and Christianity is that the local churches in the recovery try their best to do everything according to the Bible, the Word of God. The Bible reveals that the church as the Body of Christ is universally and uniquely one. Because all the members of the Body of Christ exist on earth in different cities, this unique Body of Christ is expressed among people on earth in many cities—one city, one church. Whereas Catholicism, the denominations, and the independent groups are “houses of Micah,” we meet as a local church, as the church in a particular city. In the Scriptures there are no house churches, street churches, state churches, or district churches. Instead, there are local churches. The local church in a city is a part of the Body. Therefore, we practice the local churches, and we also practice the universal Body of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="9eah38sKhajVtOxYAE_1XJXJYn1YjPebMQDKgN4QjVMJ798dMl7g_LpQYhfkwChaP"> The intrinsic significance of the books of Joshua and Judges is that these books show us the detailed points of how to possess Christ, keep Christ, and enjoy Christ. We have seen that, according to the record in Judges, in the degradation Israel became chaotic in government, in worship, and in morality. Such a people surely could not gain Christ and enjoy Him. But we thank the Lord that, in the midst of the chaotic situation, there was a person—Boaz—who had the highest standard of morality. As we will see when we come to the book of Ruth, according to typology Boaz was one who enjoyed Christ very much. </p>

In those days, when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite dwelling in the far end of the hill country of Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43967" data-verses="Judges 19:1">v. 1</span>). The concubine went about as <span class="pg" data-page-id="61" id="61">[61]</span> a harlot and departed from the Levite to her father’s house, to Bethlehem in Judah, for four months (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43968" data-verses="Judges 19:2">v. 2</span>). Her husband rose up and came after her to speak to her affectionately and to bring her back (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43969" data-verses="Judges 19:3-9">vv. 3-9</span>). He brought her from her father’s house, went through Jerusalem, and came to Gibeah, which belonged to Benjamin. He sat in the square of the city, but no one took them into his house to lodge them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43970" data-verses="Judges 19:10-15">vv. 10-15</span>). In the evening an old man out of the field from his work saw the wayfarer in the square of the city and brought him and his concubine to his house and took them as his guests (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43971" data-verses="Judges 19:16-21">vv. 16-21</span>). </p>

The old man, the master of the house, came out and said to them, “No, my brothers; do not do this evil thing, I beg you. Since this man has come into my house, do not commit this folly. Here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. Let me bring them out, I beg you; and humble them and do to them what seems good in your sight. But to this man do not do such folly” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43973" data-verses="Judges 19:23-24">vv. 23-24</span>). But the worthless men did not want to listen to the old man; so the Levite took hold of his concubine and brought her out to them; and they knew her. They abused her all night long until morning (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43974" data-verses="Judges 19:25">v. 25</span>). In the early morning the concubine came and fell at the entrance of the old man’s house, where her lord had been until it was light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43975" data-verses="Judges 19:26">v. 26</span>). </p>
