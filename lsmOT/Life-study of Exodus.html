The sixty-six books of the Bible were written over a period of approximately sixteen hundred years. During this long period, God did not speak once for all at one specific time. Rather, He spoke to His people progressively, time after time, over a long period. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP-2Zf-T_8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31825" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">Colossians 1:25</span> Paul said that he was made a minister according to the economy of God “to complete the word of God.” At the time of Paul, God’s revelation in the Scriptures had not been completed. Thus, there was the need for Paul to take up the burden to speak and to write in order to complete the Word of God. It is John’s writing in the book of Revelation, however, that marks the completion of the divine revelation in the Scriptures. Because the revelation is complete, we are warned neither to add to nor to take away from the words of God’s revelation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31826" data-verses="Revelation 22:18-19">Rev. 22:18-19</span>). Now that God’s progressive revelation in the Scriptures has been completed, no one is permitted to add anything to it. What we need to do today is to read, study, and even search the Bible progressively book by book. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2hizkhOlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS">I. A COMPARISON</h2><p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3j3yJ7lUyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> Having completed the life-study of Genesis, we come now to the book of Exodus. Historically, Exodus is the continuation of Genesis. Experientially, however, Exodus is not a continuation of Genesis. According to spiritual experience, what is portrayed in Exodus is not a continuation of the experience of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as recorded in Genesis. In our study of Genesis we pointed out that the <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> experiences of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are three sections of the experience of one person, one believer: the experience of being called and of living in fellowship with God by faith (Abraham), the experience of enjoying the inheritance (Isaac), and the experience of transformation (Jacob). In Genesis we have a clear picture of the three main sections of a believer’s spiritual experience. Because the Old Testament presents such a vivid and detailed picture of spiritual experience, the Old Testament has become very precious to me, and I have come to regard it highly. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9vBevElQ9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> Spiritual experience has not only sections, but also different sides, different aspects. The portrait of our experience in Genesis covers just one side, one line. In Exodus we see another side, another line. The record of experience presented in Genesis is marvelous, but it is not complete. For the completion we need another aspect, which is found in Exodus. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC4xWo-Ppy81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO">A. A Picture of Redemption</h2><p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4fsYo07UCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> By comparing Exodus with Genesis we can see how Exodus presents a side or line of spiritual experience not found in Genesis. For example, in Genesis we do not have a clear picture of redemption. With Abraham we see God’s calling, but there is no account of Abraham’s redemption. Abraham was an example of a typical called one; he was called by God out of Chaldea, out of the land of Babel, a land of rebellion and idolatry. When Abraham was still living in Babel, the God of glory appeared to him and called him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31827" data-verses="Acts 7:2">Acts 7:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31828" data-verses="Acts 7:3">3</span>). But there is no clear word concerning redemption. The picture we see in all of Isaac’s experience is a picture of the enjoyment of the rich inheritance rather than a picture of redemption. Neither is there a picture of redemption in the record of Jacob’s experience. Although Jacob was eventually transformed into an Israel, a prince of God, there is no record regarding Jacob’s experience of redemption. Where then were Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob redeemed? They were redeemed in Exodus. In this book we have a clear and full picture concerning God’s redemption. <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP-2Zf6BP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> What portrait of redemption could be clearer than that of the Passover? Not even in the New Testament do we find a more detailed picture. The Passover is a beautiful picture of our redemption. In this picture there is even an indication of the cross. I once read an article describing how the Passover lamb was slain by the Jews. According to this article, they took two wooden bars and formed a cross. Then they tied two of the lamb’s legs to the foot of the cross and fastened the other outstretched legs to the cross bar. Following this, the lamb was slain so that all its blood was shed. Hence, in the picture of the Passover we see the cross. Furthermore, as we consider the portrait of the Passover, we receive a vivid impression of the powerfulness of the blood of the Lamb of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31829" data-verses="Exodus 12:13">Exodus 12:13</span> says, “And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.” Such a wonderful picture is in Exodus, but not in Genesis. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2hizkmclAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS">B. The Lord’s Care<br/>for His Redeemed People</h2><p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3j3yJ93EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> Another contrast between Genesis and Exodus is seen in the matter of the Lord’s care for His people. After Abraham was called, he began to follow the Lord. Not knowing where he was to go, Abraham enjoyed the presence of the Lord as his living road map. He simply journeyed according to the Lord’s presence. Although Abraham traveled the long distance from Chaldea to the land of Canaan, the book of Genesis does not tell us how the Lord supported him or took care of him. We know, of course, in a general way that the Lord supplied Abraham with all he needed, but in Genesis we do not have the same kind of specific instances showing the Lord’s direct care for Abraham as we have in Exodus showing His care for His people. In Exodus from the very beginning we have a clear and detailed record of how the Lord took care of His redeemed people. When they were short of food, He supplied them with manna. When they had no water to drink, He gave them living water out of the cleft <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> rock. In Exodus we see not only the Lord’s leading but also a vivid portrait of how the Lord took care of the daily needs of His redeemed people. In this matter Exodus is more detailed and solid than Genesis. Not even in the New Testament do we find such a picture of the spiritual life supply. This should cause us to be impressed with the significance and importance of the book of Exodus. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9vBevN2w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm">C. The Lord’s Leading</h2><p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC4xWo-H6C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> Some further comparisons will make this impression even stronger. Although the Lord led Abraham by His presence, the Lord’s leading in Genesis is rather vague and abstract. In Exodus, however, it is much more solid and substantial, for in Exodus the Lord led His people by means of the pillar, something strong and solid. As we all know, in the daytime the Lord’s presence was a pillar of cloud, and during the night it was a pillar of fire. Because the Lord’s leading had a visible substance, all the people could recognize it. </p>

The Revelation and Building<br/>of God’s Dwelling Place</h2><p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8EL-1K2xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31830" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span> God visited Abraham and ate with him; He stayed with Abraham for part of a day. However, in Genesis there is no clear revelation regarding the tabernacle as God’s dwelling place. In Exodus there is not only the revelation of the pattern of God’s dwelling place, but there is also a detailed record of the actual building of God’s dwelling place in a practical way. In Genesis God appeared to His chosen people again and again, but He did not have a substantial dwelling place among them. The book of Exodus, however, records in a very full way both the revelation and the building of the tabernacle as God’s dwelling place on earth. </p>

Individual Experience and<br/>Corporate Experience</h2><p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh82fqmMovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> A further contrast between Genesis and Exodus is seen in the difference between individual experience and <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> corporate experience. The experience in Genesis is primarily individual, but the experience in Exodus is corporate. Abraham, for example, was called as an individual. Even what the Lord gained by transforming Jacob into Israel was an individual matter. Jacob had twelve sons, but all except Joseph were below the standard. The entire experience portrayed in Exodus, on the contrary, is corporate. The redemption, the leading, the revelation, and the building are all corporate matters. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-2K90Yd1c9qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> In our spiritual experience there are two sides, the individual side and the corporate side. No doubt, the individual side is basic, but the corporate side is richer, higher, and greater. The ultimate consummation and completion of our experience as believers is not individual; it is corporate. In Genesis we have the basic, individual experience, but in Exodus we have the ultimate, corporate experience. </p>

This is proved by the way Exodus begins: “Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, which came into Egypt” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31862" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">1:1</span>, Heb.). Genesis has a wonderful beginning but a poor conclusion. It opens with the words, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Heb.). But it ends with the statement, “So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31863" data-verses="Genesis 50:26">Gen. 50:26</span>). Thus, Genesis concludes with a dead man in a coffin in Egypt. This indicates that God’s chosen people were in a situation of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB5LJyfMwqRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31864" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">Exodus 1</span> is a further exposure of the condition of God’s people in Egypt. Although they were in death, they were not inactive, for they were living and active in death. This is Paul’s thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31865" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span>, where we are told that those who are dead in trespasses and sins walk according to the age of the world, behave in the lusts of the flesh, and carry out the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts. Those who are spiritually dead still have their works, but they are dead works, works of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZVyD85W8JlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31866" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">Chapter one</span> of Exodus is a detailed record of the activities of God’s people in their situation of death in Egypt. Forced to labor as slaves of Pharaoh, they were already in death and yet they were daily being killed. It may sound strange to say that the dead are being killed, but this is true in spiritual experience. Although the worldly people are already spiritually dead, they are continuously being killed. The situation among the worldly people today, like that among God’s people in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31867" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">Exodus 1</span>, is characterized by slavery <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> and death. People are firstly enslaved by the world and then they are deadened and killed by it. People may think that human culture is progressing in a positive way, but in the eyes of God there is more slavery and death on earth today than ever before. Before we came to Christ and were saved, we also were enslaved and deadened. Furthermore, before we came into the church life in the Lord’s recovery, many of us continued to be enslaved and deadened, even after we had been saved. We all need to be on the alert lest we be enslaved and deadened once more. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-ZOQcNi4s4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> The book of Genesis has a good beginning but ends with a poor situation, whereas Exodus begins with a poor situation but ends gloriously. We have pointed out that Genesis begins with God’s creation but ends with a dead man in a coffin in Egypt. Exodus, on the contrary, opens with a picture of God’s people being enslaved and in death, but concludes with the ark in the tabernacle that is filled with the glory of God. What a tremendous difference between the end of Genesis and the end of Exodus! Where do you prefer to be—in a coffin in Egypt or with the ark in the tabernacle that is filled with God’s glory? </p>

RELATED TO THEIR LIVELIHOOD</h2><p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTi5OAMrQmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> In this message we shall consider the slavery of the children of Israel. The Israelites were born in Canaan. Because of a food shortage, they were forced to go down to Egypt, where they eventually were enslaved. By this we see that people become enslaved primarily out of the need to maintain their livelihood, out of the need to make a living. Worldly people are drawn to various entertainments because they desire a better living. Likewise, people today pursue higher education or technical training in order to secure a good living, even the best living. Throughout the world, whether in developed nations or in backward countries, people are enslaved due to the need to earn a living. This was also the situation with the children of Israel in Egypt. <span class="pg" data-page-id="15" id="15">[15]</span> </p>

Egypt Typifying the World</h2><p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-DwsxcMx7qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> According to the Bible, the world has at least three aspects: the aspect of rebellion and idolatry, signified by Babel; the aspect of sinfulness, signified by Sodom; and the aspect of enjoyment and pleasure, signified by Egypt. Rebellion is related to idolatry, the worship of anything other than God. Because those who worship idols are in rebellion against God, idol worship signifies rebellion. In the Bible Babel is a symbol of the rebellious and idolatrous world. On earth today there are idols everywhere, even in Christian countries. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNFY_IHDbKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> Abraham was called out of the land of Babel, that is, out of the world of rebellion and idolatry. God’s calling Abraham out of the land of Babel symbolizes our being called out of the rebellious and idolatrous world. But as we have pointed out, the calling of Abraham represents just one aspect of our salvation from the world. </p>

Egypt signifies the world of enjoyment, the world of pleasure. Those who are involved with this aspect of the world are not ensnared primarily by rebellion or idolatry; they are fully occupied by pleasure, by the rich material supply and physical enjoyment of the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31868" data-verses="Genesis 12:10">Gen. 12:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31869" data-verses="Genesis 42:1">42:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31870" data-verses="Numbers 11:4-5">Num. 11:4-5</span>). The river Nile, which irrigates the land of Egypt, makes the land rich in produce. When the children of Israel were wandering in the wilderness, they said, “We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31871" data-verses="Numbers 11:5">Num. 11:5</span>). All these items represent the material riches of the world for enjoyment and pleasure. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVNjXNEKXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> Before we were saved, we were not only in the world of rebellion and idolatry, but also in the world of riches and enjoyment. Abraham was called out of the rebellious world, but the children of Israel made their exodus out of the world <span class="pg" data-page-id="16" id="16">[16]</span> of enjoyment. Egypt was rich not only in food supply but also in gold. This is proved by the fact that the Egyptians gave gold to the Israelites at the time of the exodus. </p>

The children of Israel were enslaved to that aspect of the world which gave them their livelihood and afforded them their enjoyment. Whether they are rich or poor, many today are slaves to money. They work hard to earn a large amount of money and then in a short time they spend all they have to indulge in the pleasures of the world. Thus many today do not serve God, but mammon. This was the situation among the ancient Israelites in the land of Egypt. In Egypt they made a good living and they enjoyed the riches of the world. But Egypt kept them from fulfilling the purpose for which God had originally called them. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTN1gxVRfNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> In Egypt the children of Israel became strong. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31873" data-verses="Exodus 1:7">Exodus 1:7</span> says, “And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew strong exceedingly; and the land was filled with them” (Heb.). In one sense, to become strong is to become rich. Without money, a nation cannot be strong. For example, the United States is a strong nation because of its economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5ZTJlOfEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> The children of Israel enjoyed the aspect of the world typified by Egypt. They were not in the first aspect of the world, typified by Babel, nor in the second aspect, represented by Sodom. But they were enslaved in the third aspect, signified by Egypt. Because they were occupied by the riches and enjoyment of the world, they were kept from fulfilling the purpose for which God had created and chosen them. In the same principle, all the worldly people today have been usurped by Satan. As a result, they do not know God’s purpose. How we need to thank the Lord for delivering <span class="pg" data-page-id="17" id="17">[17]</span> us from slavery in the world and for setting us free from the usurping hand of Satan! </p>

In the second chapter we see the preparation of a savior for the children of Israel. Although these two chapters are separate, there is an underlying theme that binds them together. This theme is that in times of crisis God uses the female life for His purpose. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31905" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">Exodus 1</span> God used the midwives, the female life, to preserve the male life for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. Pharaoh’s intention was to kill the male life, which represents the life for God’s purpose, but to preserve the female life, which represents the life for man’s pleasure. No doubt, Pharaoh intended to preserve the female life for his own pleasure. Pharaoh attempted to use the midwives to carry out his evil intention. But in God’s sovereignty the midwives refused to cooperate with Pharaoh’s plot. Although Pharaoh was a powerful ruler, even a tyrant, the midwives were not afraid of him, nor did they hearken to his word. Instead of killing the baby boys, the midwives preserved them. Hence, God used the female life to maintain the male life for His purpose. </p>

THROUGH THE FEMALE LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBgvj71fFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31906" data-verses="Exodus 2:1">Exodus 2</span> there is the need for the preparation of a savior to deliver God’s people out of the hand of Pharaoh’s tyranny. In preparing the savior, God firstly used not the male life but the female life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31907" data-verses="Exodus 2:1-10">vv. 1-10</span>). The female whom God used strategically for this purpose was found in Pharaoh’s very household—it was Pharaoh’s own daughter. This reminds us of Paul’s word in Philippians concerning “those <span class="pg" data-page-id="26" id="26">[26]</span> of Caesar’s household” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31908" data-verses="Philippians 4:22">4:22</span>). Although Caesar had put the Apostle Paul into prison, at least some of Caesar’s household became Christians. In the same principle, although Pharaoh tried to kill all the male infants born among the Hebrews, God sovereignly used Pharaoh’s daughter to preserve the most important male born to the children of Israel in Egypt. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_BksDj74Mk5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31909" data-verses="Hebrews 11:23">Hebrews 11:23</span> says that Moses “was hid three months by his parents,” but <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31910" data-verses="Exodus 2:2">Exodus 2:2</span> mentions only that his mother hid him three months. The reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31911" data-verses="Exodus 2:1">Exodus 2</span> mentions only the mother is to emphasize the fact that during times of crisis it is the female life that is useful to God. If it had not been for the midwives in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31912" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">chapter one</span>, Israel could have been exterminated. Likewise, without the female life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31913" data-verses="Exodus 2:1">chapter two</span>, there would have been no way for God to prepare a savior to rescue the children of Israel. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31914" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">Exodus 1</span> God used the female life to preserve His people, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31915" data-verses="Exodus 2:1">Exodus 2</span> He used the female life to prepare a savior for His people, the people He had preserved for the fulfillment of His plan. Not only the sisters but also the brothers should be thankful for the function of the female life. In fact, in a proper sense, all the believers in Christ, both brothers and sisters, should be females in the eyes of God, because the female pictures the dependent life, the life utterly dependent on God. </p>

The first was Moses’ mother, a daughter of Levi (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31917" data-verses="Exodus 2:1">2:1</span>). The name of Moses’ father was Amram, and the name of his mother was Jochebed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31918" data-verses="Numbers 26:58-59">Num. 26:58-59</span>). The emphasis in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31919" data-verses="Numbers 26:1">Numbers 26</span> is on names, but the emphasis in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31920" data-verses="Exodus 2:1">Exodus 2</span> is on the female life. For this reason, with the exception of Zipporah, Moses’ wife, this chapter does not mention the names of any females. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m5GKICMoyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> After Moses’ mother gave birth to Moses, she hid him for three months. When she could no longer hide him, she put him in an ark of papyrus and laid it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile. Later, however, she was hired by Pharaoh’s daughter to nurse him for a period of time. Thus, the first <span class="pg" data-page-id="27" id="27">[27]</span> female mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31921" data-verses="Exodus 2:1">Exodus 2</span> was the mother of Moses, the life that brought him forth in birth and nursed him. </p>

Moses’ father, mother, and sister may have held a family conference concerning what to do with Moses when they could no longer hide him. I believe that the Lord led them to make that ark of papyrus. The same Hebrew word is used for this ark and for the ark built by Noah. Although this ark was a great deal smaller than the one built by Noah, the function of both arks was the same: to preserve life by causing the ones in them to pass through water. Moses’ family might have known that Pharaoh’s daughter was in the habit of bathing at a certain place in the river, and it might have been their hope that Moses would be discovered by her and raised by her. With Moses’ father in the background, the mother and the sister worked together to carry out the plan. After the ark had been “laid...in the reeds by the river’s brink...his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31922" data-verses="Exodus 2:3-4">2:3-4</span>, Heb.). When Pharaoh’s daughter saw the baby and had compassion on him, Moses’ sister recommended that his mother be asked to nurse him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31923" data-verses="Exodus 2:7-8">vv. 7-8</span>). Moses’ sister thus watched over the male life and established the connection between Pharaoh’s daughter and Moses’ mother. </p>

Here we see the part played by a female slave. This slave is the third female mentioned in this chapter. Again the name is not given in order to underscore God’s intention of impressing us with the female life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31925" data-verses="Exodus 2:1">Exodus 2</span> we see several females gathered about an ark in which a three-month-old baby boy had been laid. Each of these females had a different function. The function of the female slave was to serve. In particular, her service was fetching the ark. <span class="pg" data-page-id="28" id="28">[28]</span> </p>

First she rescued Moses and then charged Moses’ mother to nurse him. Later, when the child was brought to Pharaoh’s daughter, “he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31926" data-verses="Exodus 2:10">v. 10</span>). We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31927" data-verses="Acts 7:21">Acts 7:21</span> that “Pharaoh’s daughter took him up and nurtured him as her own son.” </p>

For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31931" data-verses="Acts 7:20">Acts 7:20</span> says that Moses was “handsome to God.” This means that in the sight of God Moses was very comely. His parents must have been godly. Possessing spiritual insight and discernment, they realized that Moses was a very promising child for God’s purpose. Therefore, they hid him three months “because they saw that he was a handsome child” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31932" data-verses="Hebrews 11:23">Heb. 11:23</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd86_6qzFcZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> The emphasis in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31933" data-verses="Exodus 2:1">Exodus 2</span> is not on the spiritual significance of Moses’ early life; it is on the important role played by the female life. Although the writings of Moses are elsewhere very descriptive, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31934" data-verses="Exodus 2:1">Exodus 2</span> he gives us a very simple record in order to impress us with the way God uses the female life in times of crisis. During critical times, the only life that can be used by God is the female life that stands with God and is dependent upon Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIGP6IRh-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> We are living in a critical time, a time when the female life is urgently needed. Anyone who presumes to be a male will become a Pharaoh. All of us, including the brothers, need to be females. In a critical time such as now, the male life that is independent of God is not useful. Only the female life, the life that depends on God, is prevailing. If we see this, we shall have a great appreciation for the female life, the life that is wholly dependent on God. </p>

God’s intention as seen in this book is to have a people to build Him a dwelling place on earth. Thus, at the end of Exodus the tabernacle is erected to be God’s dwelling place. Furthermore, for the fulfillment of God’s purpose, there is also the need for an army to fight for God’s interests on earth. The children of Israel came out of Egypt as a collective people, and right away they were formed into an army. From the time of their redemption until the conquest of the good land, they had to subdue the enemies, especially the enemies who had occupied and fully possessed the land promised to them. If the children of Israel were to enjoy the good land and to fulfill God’s purpose of building a temple as God’s testimony on earth, they had to fight to deliver the land from the usurping hand of the enemy. Therefore, to be useful to God is related to building up His dwelling place and to fighting for His interests on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7TnIuYSKO1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> The life useful to God in these matters is the female life. According to the natural concept, however, it should be the male life that is useful to God. This is because the males are good fighters, whereas the females are regarded as weaker ones. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9Imp5lOCnJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> Not many readers of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31962" data-verses="Exodus 1:1-2">Exodus 1 and 2</span> have seen the underlying theme that links these chapters. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31963" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">Chapter one</span> shows that the people of God were under slavery, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31964" data-verses="Exodus 2:1">chapter two</span> reveals how God prepared one to save His people out of bondage. The underlying theme is that God needs a certain kind of life both to preserve His people and to prepare a savior to deliver them from bondage. Both the preservation <span class="pg" data-page-id="38" id="38">[38]</span> of the people and the preparation of the savior were accomplished only through the female life. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGt95B2LvVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> In the Bible the concept of a “male” is rich in meaning. It refers, of course, to a man, but it also indicates an independent life. Furthermore, it refers to Christ as the unique male in the universe. All married brothers need to realize that they are simply husbands in shadow and that the real husband is Christ. Because God is the unique husband, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31965" data-verses="Isaiah 54:5">Isaiah 54:5</span> says, “Thy Maker is thine husband.” In the Old Testament God regarded His people as His spouse (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="31966" data-verses="Hosea 2:19">Hosea 2:19</span>). No matter whether an Israelite was a male or a female, he or she was part of God’s corporate wife. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPR8Xkj9JfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> In the Bible the term “husband” indicates headship, and it also indicates an independent life. When we speak of a male in the positive sense, we have in mind a husband who is the head and who has an independent life. Because God is the unique husband in the universe, only He is the head and only He has an independent life. It is blasphemous to say that God needs to depend on anyone or anything. It is also blasphemous to claim that we can be independent of Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnC5h-RjvPiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> As females, the married sisters should not usurp the headship, nor should they live in an independent way. Rather, they must live a life of dependence upon their husbands, who are but shadows of the Lord as the real husband. Although the married brothers are husbands in shadow with respect to their wives, in actuality they are females with respect to the Lord. Therefore, they should not usurp the headship of the Lord nor have an independent life. They also should be submissive and live a life of dependence. </p>

Man, however, should not be the head of the woman in himself. He should be the head only as he himself is under the headship of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzINKNjQ8CdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> On the one hand, Christ is under the headship of God, and, on the other hand, He is the head over every man. In like manner, man, on the one hand, should be under the headship of Christ, and, on the other hand, he should be the head of the woman. It is not an easy matter to be both under the headship and to be the head over others. But in the life of Christ we see an excellent example of how this is worked out. The four Gospels reveal that Christ was always under the headship of God. Nevertheless, simultaneously He was the head of all His disciples. Christ was never independent of the Father. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31970" data-verses="John 5:30">John 5:30</span> He said, “I can do nothing from Myself,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="31971" data-verses="John 5:19">John 5:19</span> He said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, this also the Son does in like manner.” The Son was always under the headship of God the Father. However, He also exercised the headship over others. For example, He dealt with Peter very strictly whenever Peter acted as if he were the head and lived an independent life. The Lord corrected Peter by causing him to realize the headship of Christ. Just as Christ was under the headship of God the Father, so Peter had to be under the headship of Christ. In this we see that God is the head of Christ and that Christ, under the headship of God, is the head of every man. Likewise, man, under the headship of Christ, is the head of the woman. </p>

In this sense man, typifying Christ, signifies the independent life. With respect to being under the headship of God, Christ has a dependent life. But with respect to being the head of every man, Christ has an independent life. This means that Christ is dependent on God, but independent of us. In relation to God, Christ’s life is a dependent life, but in relation to us, His life is independent. Man typifies Christ as the One with an independent life. With respect to Christ, the married brothers have a dependent life, but with respect to their wives, they have an independent life. </p>

Not only did God hear their cry, but He also visited them in the place of their affliction. Hence, He fully knew their situation and was eager to rescue them from it. </p>

THE TIME OF GOD’S CALLING</h2><p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTN1hBVYPtP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> Although God wanted to deliver the children of Israel out of bondage, He had to wait until Moses had been fully prepared. These chapters of Exodus reveal that God is very patient. Even before the birth of Moses, the children of Israel were suffering in Egypt. But God still waited for at least eighty years. It is easy to be patient if you do not have the strength or ability to do anything about the situation. In such a case, you have no choice except to wait. But for one who is capable and qualified, it is difficult to be patient. God was certainly able to deliver the children of Israel; His power was sufficient. Nevertheless, He waited patiently. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5ZS5lGP0fCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> Sometimes we are exhausted by God’s patience and ask, <span class="pg" data-page-id="50" id="50">[50]</span> “How long, Lord? Have You heard our prayers? Lord, where are You? Don’t You care for us? How long will it be before You do something for us?” It seems that there is no God in this universe. In the psalms such questions are asked again and again, for the psalmists were the same as we are. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd86_7KzFeZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> It is good for us to be exhausted by the patience of God because after we are exhausted, we rest. We may be so exhausted that we give up praying. We know that God is true and real and that He has His timing. Therefore, we learn to leave the matter with Him. Then we shall be at rest. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIGOaIRj-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> After forty years of his life had gone by, Moses could no longer wait to deliver the children of Israel. He had received the highest education, and he had become a man powerful in words and in deeds (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32001" data-verses="Acts 7:22">Acts 7:22</span>). According to his own estimation, no doubt he thought he was qualified and ready to act on behalf of his people. But God set Moses aside for another forty years, until he was fully prepared according to God’s standard. In this we see the patience of our God. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbAKO9gI7HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> What made it necessary for God to wait those eighty years? None of us would have been willing to wait such a long time. Surely God wanted a way to come in earlier than He did, but there was no one among the children of Israel to whom He could come. Therefore, God had to wait until Moses was born. Forty years later Moses was there, and had grown up, but God still had to wait because Moses was so natural. God had to wait because there was the lack of a prepared one. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0SQzMJujsWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> Here we see a principle. In every age God has desired to do something. The problem has not been on His side; it has always been on the side of His people. The question has always been this: where is one who is ready to receive God’s call? In our age also God is eager to do certain things. But who is ready for His call? More than nineteen centuries ago the Lord Jesus said that He was coming quickly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32002" data-verses="Revelation 22:7">Rev. 22:7</span>). But He still has not come. If we ask the Lord why His coming back has been delayed so long, He may reply, “Where are those who are ready for Me to come back? When I see that a sufficient number are ready, I shall come. I am very <span class="pg" data-page-id="51" id="51">[51]</span> eager to come back, but there must be something for Me to come back to.” </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYNBTIJBazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> In Exodus God could not come in when Moses was a child or when he was still trusting in his natural strength and ability. God had to wait until Moses was eighty years of age. Then, after Moses had been prepared, God came in to call him. The children of Israel cried out because of the tyranny, the persecution, and the oppression, but God still had to wait for Moses to be prepared. In the same principle, the Lord continues to delay His coming back because not enough of His people are ready for Him to return. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l_DkgAPMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32003" data-verses="Exodus 2:1">chapters two and three</span> of Exodus we see that the persecuted children of God were crying out to Him and that the God of mercy, grace, and love was eager to rescue them. But Moses was growing slowly unto maturity. The cry of the Israelites was desperate and the eagerness of God was great, but the growth of Moses was slow. The situation is the same today. Many saints have been sighing and longing for the Lord to come back, and the Lord is yearning to come back. But where are the prepared ones? Therefore, instead of complaining to the Lord about today’s situation, we should give ourselves to grow in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBguD7yMFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> When by God’s sovereignty Moses was set aside, he must have been very disappointed and he must have lost all hope. Having lost hope, he became content to be a shepherd caring for the flock in the land of Midian. A man who had been educated in the royal palace was now forced to live as a shepherd in the wilderness. As the years went by, he lost everything—his confidence, his future, his interest, his goal. Eventually, Moses probably reached the point where he had no further thought that he was the one whom God would use to rescue the children of Israel from bondage in Egypt. Moses might have said to himself, “I must care for this flock. But not even this flock is mine; it belongs to my father-in-law. I have no empire, no kingdom. There is nothing left for me to do except to labor in support of my family. My immediate concern is to find fresh grass for the flock and water for them to drink.” But one day, when Moses had been <span class="pg" data-page-id="52" id="52">[52]</span> thoroughly processed, God appeared to him and called him. At the age of eighty, in the eyes of God Moses was fully prepared and qualified, and at the precise time He came to him. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Bktjj9rck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> The record of God’s calling of Moses is longer than the record of His calling of any other person in the Bible. The record of His calling of Abraham is brief, and so is that of Isaiah. The same is true of the calling of Peter and of Saul of Tarsus. But the record of the calling of Moses is lengthy and detailed. In this account we find all the basic points concerning God’s calling. Thus, if we would know the full significance of God’s calling, we must pay close attention to God’s calling of Moses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32004" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GkZl6fvZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> Moses was the first complete, qualified, and perfected servant of God in history. Noah was used by God to build the ark, but he was not the kind of servant Moses was. Not even Abraham, the father of faith, was perfected as a servant of God in the way Moses was. Because he was the first fully qualified servant of God in the Bible, Moses is the standard model of God’s servant, and God’s calling of him is the standard for His calling of all His servants. In principle, we all need to be called the way Moses was. </p>

<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGvCzw5B-PzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32005" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3:1</span> says, “Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back side of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.” One day Moses led the flock to the back side of the desert. This indicates that we can be called only when we are at the back side of our situation, never when we are at the front. I believe that Moses led the flock to the back side of the desert because he was looking for the best pasture. He might have been dissatisfied with the familiar places, and he might have desired a new place. Thus, he went to the back side. </p>

<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0Jyh27ZoJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> Both on the negative side and on the positive side, God’s purpose in calling Moses was very great. Negatively, God called him to deliver the children of Israel out of the tyranny of the Egyptians. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32043" data-verses="Exodus 3:8">3:8</span> the Lord said, “I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians.” At the time God called Moses, Egypt was the leading country on earth, and Pharaoh had absolute power. Here was a man now eighty years of age, one who had spent the last forty years of his life shepherding a flock in the wilderness. How could such a one deliver the Israelites from Pharaoh’s tyrannical power? To Moses, it might have seemed impossible. Nevertheless, this was the purpose of God’s calling on the negative side. </p>

, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32045" data-verses="Exodus 3:10">10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32046" data-verses="Exodus 3:17">17</span>). Humanly speaking, the positive side of God’s calling was even more of an impossibility than the negative side. Such a thing could only be a dream. But this is precisely what God was calling Moses to do, even though forty years before he had turned his back on the highest culture on earth in his day and had been shepherding a flock in the wilderness ever since. </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36QAVLLNBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> The nation of Egypt typifies the kingdom of darkness, and Pharaoh typifies Satan, the Devil. How can God’s people be delivered out of the hand of such an evil power and be rescued from the kingdom of darkness? Today this is done through the preaching of the gospel. Do not think that preaching the gospel to bring people to salvation is an easy task. To bring a person out of Satan’s hand and out of the kingdom of darkness is a mighty work. For this reason, the divine revelation in the New Testament places a very high value on the preaching of the gospel. Paul says that the gospel is the power of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32047" data-verses="Romans 1:16">Rom. 1:16</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0Jyh29LYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> The purpose of God’s calling is a matter of tremendous significance. In typology, bringing the children of Israel into the good land signifies bringing people into Christ, the all-inclusive Person typified by the land of Canaan. Christ today is a good land flowing with milk and honey. </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneHKM97LVHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> In His wisdom God uses the expression “flowing with milk and honey” to describe the riches of the good land. Both milk and honey are products of a combination of the vegetable life and the animal life. Milk comes from cattle, which feed on grass. The animal life produces milk from the supply of the vegetable life. Therefore, milk is a product of the mingling of two kinds of life. The principle is the same with honey. Honey has much to do with the plant life. It is derived mostly from flowers and trees. Of course, a part of the animal life is also involved—that little animal, the bee. Hence, in the production of honey, two kinds of life cooperate. These two kinds of life are mingled together, and honey is produced. <span class="pg" data-page-id="63" id="63">[63]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2SRxwzBoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> Milk and honey signify the riches of Christ, riches that come from the two aspects of the life of Christ. Although Christ is one Person, He has the redeeming life, typified by the animal life, and the generating life, typified by the vegetable life. On the one hand, Christ is the Lamb of God to redeem us; on the other hand, He is a loaf of barley to supply us. Both kinds of life were part of the Passover meal, for in the Passover there were the lamb and the unleavened bread with bitter herbs. These lives were combined for the enjoyment of God’s redeemed people. The purpose of God’s calling, however, is not to give His people a little enjoyment of the animal life and the vegetable life in Egypt; it is to bring them into a spacious land flowing with milk and honey. Do you have the assurance that in the church life today you are enjoying Christ as the good land? I can testify that I daily enjoy Christ as a spacious land flowing with milk and honey. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zHvxavzSXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> Who was qualified to bring God’s people out of the land of Egypt into such a marvelous land? Before Moses was sovereignly prepared by God, there was no one who could have done this. Even before he reached the age of forty, Moses must have known that his people, the children of Israel, were in bondage and were suffering persecution. Having realized this, he might have determined to learn everything necessary to equip him to rescue his people. However, Moses probably did not see clearly that the goal was not just to deliver God’s people out of Egypt, but to bring them into the good land. After the children of Israel had been brought out of Egypt, they needed a goal, a destination. Although Moses was not altogether clear concerning the goal, he still expected to do something on behalf of his people. He “refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing rather to be ill-treated with the people of God than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32048" data-verses="Hebrews 11:24-25">Heb. 11:24-25</span>). At the age of forty, he considered himself matured, qualified, and equipped to deliver them. Actually, he was not able to do anything. In himself he did not have the power to rescue <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> the people. As soon as the situation became threatening, he fled. </p>

<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wNztW3K_vl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> God spent another forty years to bring this capable yet disappointed man to the end. It is not an easy matter to terminate such a person. It took forty years of discipline to make Moses realize that he was not qualified to deliver God’s people out of Egypt and to bring them into the good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4aoK-JgqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> During his first few years in the wilderness, Moses might have complained about his fellow Hebrew who refused to recognize him as the deliverer of Israel. Moses might have said, “How blind he was! He didn’t realize that I was the one to deliver them. Because of him, I was forced to flee. No one among the children of Israel can do what I could have done. But now everything is ruined.” I believe that as year after year went by, Moses’ attitude began to change; eventually he no longer blamed others for his situation. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj9E4XHIF4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> It is easy to educate a person, but it is very difficult to terminate him. But after those years in the wilderness, Moses was fully terminated. When God appeared to him in the burning thorn-bush, Moses considered himself good for nothing but death. Nevertheless, at that very juncture, when Moses thought that he was finished, God came in to call him. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_bVwl2_StcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> God dealt with Moses and prepared him over a span of forty years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32049" data-verses="Acts 7:30">Acts 7:30</span>). We know that Moses was dealt with just by the fact that he had to live in the wilderness after having been raised in the royal palace. Suppose someone raised in the United States is suddenly forced to live in a very backward country. Day by day that person will have the feeling that he is being dealt with. Moses, no doubt, had this feeling in the wilderness as he worked as a shepherd to care for a flock that did not even belong to him, but belonged to his father-in-law. Through such a dealing, Moses was gradually prepared. <span class="pg" data-page-id="65" id="65">[65]</span> </p>

In the eyes of God, Moses was a thorn-bush. No one has much appreciation for a thorn-bush. Although Moses had been rejected by man, he was accepted by God, and the fire of God’s glory burned within him and upon him. Therefore, Moses was a thorn-bush burning with the glory of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj9E4HHMVIFazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> The burning thorn-bush in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32076" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span>, however, refers not only to Moses as an individual but also to the children of Israel as a corporate entity. God’s people, the children of Israel, included those who were weak and those who were strong. Moses was only one among God’s corporate people. To the Lord, the thorn-bush burning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32077" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">chapter three</span> was not only an individual but also a corporate people. My burden in this message is to consider the corporate aspect of the thorn-bush. As individuals, we all are today’s Moses. But we are also part of the church as the corporate thorn-bush. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_bVw127ANcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> God’s goal in dealing with His people, the children of Israel, was to obtain a proper dwelling place. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32078" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:16">Deuteronomy 33:16</span> speaks of God as the One who dwelt in the thorn-bush. This word, written by Moses, indicates that God possessed that burning thorn-bush as His house, His dwelling place. Who would ever have thought that God’s habitation on earth would be a thorn-bush? </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vVvSdrnXqd_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> Moses must have realized that the burning thorn-bush he saw when God called him was a symbol of himself. At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32079" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:1">Deuteronomy 33</span>, Moses regarded himself as a thorn-bush, but to God he was “the man of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32080" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:1">Deut. 33:1</span>). In the individual aspect Moses was a thorn-bush, and in the corporate aspect the children of Israel were a thorn-bush. <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> Nevertheless, the God of blessing dwelt in such a bush. If God does not dwell in us, we are finished. Without Him we are nothing more than ordinary thorn-bushes. Although we may be cultured ladies and gentlemen or well-trained professionals, we still are thorn-bushes because our fallen nature is related to thorns and to the curse. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4fsZI0yGiuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> In referring to God as the One who dwelt in the thorn-bush, Moses’ heart must have been full of thanks to God. During the last forty years of his life, Moses knew that he was just a thorn-bush. But he knew also that God was with him. We all need to have such a realization. Whenever we have a proper spirit before the Lord, we know that we are a thorn-bush. We know that even our natural virtues, such as kindness, humility, and patience, are “thorns.” Sometimes we may even feel like prostrating ourselves before the Lord and confessing to Him how pitiful we are. As he was blessing the children of Israel, Moses must have had such a sense about himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP-35fyT_8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> A well-known gospel song says, “I’m only a sinner saved by grace.” The sense Moses had was much deeper, even more tender and sweet than this, for he realized he was a thorn-bush burned by the glory of God. Today, as believers in Christ, we are not merely sinners saved by grace; we are a thorn-bush burning with the fire of God’s glory. Moses had this realization both about himself and about the children of Israel as God’s corporate people. Deep within he knew that both he personally and the Israelites corporately were a thorn-bush. </p>

In both chapters we have the thorn and the fire. The thorn in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32083" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> indicates that man is under a curse (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32084" data-verses="Genesis 3:17-18">vv. 17-18</span>), and the flame of fire indicates that man is excluded from God as the tree of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32085" data-verses="Genesis 3:22-24">vv. 22-24</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32086" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>, thorns came from the curse due to sin. Hence, thorns are a symbol of fallen man under the <span class="pg" data-page-id="75" id="75">[75]</span> curse. Immediately after the curse was pronounced, a flaming sword was placed at the east of the garden “to keep the way of the tree of life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32087" data-verses="Genesis 3:24">v. 24</span>
). Thus, sin brought in the curse, and the curse brought in the flame of fire. The function of fire in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32088" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> is to exclude sinners from the tree of life, that is, from God as the source of life. </p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32090" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapters one and two</span> of Genesis, we were created specifically to receive God as life. The man created by God was placed in front of the tree of life. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32091" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">chapter three</span> sin came in, man fell under the curse, and the fire of God’s holiness excluded the cursed sinners from any direct contact with God as the tree of life. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32094" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span> the cursed thorn becomes the vessel of God, and the flame of fire becomes one with the thorn-bush. Through redemption, signified by the lamb slain and offered to God for fallen man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32095" data-verses="Genesis 4:4">Gen. 4:4</span>), the curse has been taken away, and the fire has become one with the thorn. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqH7gx-hhkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> The reality of this picture is seen in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32096" data-verses="Galatians 3:13-14">Galatians 3:13 and 14</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32097" data-verses="Galatians 3:13">Verse 13</span> says, “Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf.” This means that through the death of Christ on the cross the curse has been taken away. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32098" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">Verse 14</span> continues, “That the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.” Therefore, according to these verses the curse has been taken away, and the Spirit, the fire, has been given to us. </p>

<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7TnIeYWZe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> Considering this in the light of the picture in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32101" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span>, we see that the thorn and the flame are one. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32102" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> fallen man was under the curse signified by the thorn. There the flame of fire excluded this fallen man from God as the tree of life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32103" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span>, however, the thorn-bush, which can be considered a type of vessel, and the fire are one. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32104" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> the fire keeps the man who is under the curse away from the tree of life, away from God as the source of life. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32105" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span> the flame of fire visits the thorn-bush and indwells it. This indicates that through the redemption of Christ the very God Himself, the holy One whose holiness excludes sinners from His presence, can come to visit us, to stay with us, and even to dwell in us. Hallelujah, Christ has taken away the curse and has cast down to earth the fire of the Holy Spirit! Now that the curse has been taken away, we are no longer excluded from God as life. Praise the Lord that the excluding flame of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32106" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> has become the visiting and indwelling flame of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32107" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span>!

<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9ImpJlJSHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> Those who have been Christians for years may sometimes be tempted to regard themselves as rather good or holy. If you have followed the Lord and have experienced some success in your Christian life, you may secretly consider yourself an outstanding “saint,” one who is more spiritual than other believers. However, we should realize that we are still a bush full of thorns. Do not think that you yourself are so marvelous, and do not appreciate too highly those you may admire. We all are still a thorn-bush. I am very much aware of the fact that I am a thorn-bush. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGt9JBwbfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> If we are like Moses, the man of God, we shall have a twofold consciousness. On the one hand, we shall be conscious of the fact that we are thorn-bushes; on the other hand, we shall be conscious of God’s glory dwelling within us as a burning flame. Moses became a man of God, but he still <span class="pg" data-page-id="77" id="77">[77]</span> considered himself a thorn-bush. In the same principle, God’s glory dwelt among the children of Israel and made them His glorious dwelling place, but they were still a thorn-bush, even a corporate thorn-bush. </p>

When Moses came to the back side of the desert and met God there, he beheld the sign of a thorn-bush that burned without being consumed. Although this sign was marvelous, it was somewhat objective. In this message we shall consider the three signs in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32118" data-verses="Exodus 4:1">chapter four</span>, signs which are very subjective. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8EJu1Olhnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> It is important for us to see why these three subjective signs were given. At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32119" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">chapter three</span>, God’s calling of Moses seemed to be complete. Moses had seen the objective sign of the burning thorn-bush, and he had heard God speaking to him. God gave to Moses a full revelation of Himself. Thus, on God’s side, the calling of Moses was complete. However, on Moses’ side, it was not complete. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32120" data-verses="Exodus 4:1">Exodus 4:1</span> says, “And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.” This word indicates that although Moses had seen a most marvelous sign and had heard the voice of God, he had not been inspired or moved. For this reason, the three signs found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32121" data-verses="Exodus 4:1">chapter four</span> were given. These signs were to be conclusive evidence that Moses had truly been called by God. The principle is the same with God’s called ones today. Whoever claims to be called by God should have the mark of these three subjective signs. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m5GI4CL6SQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> It is significant that the Lord showed Moses three signs, not two, not four, nor any other number. In the Bible the number three is a meaningful number. Because God is triune, the number three is related to God’s economy, to <span class="pg" data-page-id="86" id="86">[86]</span> God’s dispensation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32122" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span> there are three parables, related to the Son, the Spirit, and the Father. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32123" data-verses="Exodus 4:1">Exodus 4</span> there are three signs, dealing with the serpent, leprosy, and blood. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh80PqgcYvIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> As every reader of the Bible knows, the serpent represents Satan. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32124" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> we see Satan, the subtle serpent. The serpent in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32125" data-verses="Exodus 4:1">Exodus 4</span> is the very serpent in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32126" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>, the one who is called “the ancient serpent” in the book of Revelation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32127" data-verses="Revelation 12:9">12:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32128" data-verses="Revelation 20:2">20:2</span>). It is not adequate for the called one just to know God; every called one must also know the serpent. Not only should we know how to deal with God, how to contact God, how to have fellowship with God, and how to trust in God; we must also be able to deal with the serpent. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-2K_kYXn89qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> The leprosy in the second sign is a matter of the rottenness, corruption, and uncleanness of the flesh of sin. According to the Old Testament, every leprous person had to openly declare that he was unclean. The sin signified by leprosy is not the outward sin, but the subjective sin, the sin in our flesh. It is out from this sin that there is rottenness, corruption, and uncleanness. </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB5LLSfAwqRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> The third sign is that of water which turns into blood. Blood here signifies the death brought in by the world with its enjoyment. Therefore, blood in the third sign is related to the world. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4arq-JiqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> The serpent, leprosy, and blood are related respectively to Satan, to sin in the flesh, and to the death brought in by the world. Those who have been called by God must have not only the objective sign of the burning thorn-bush, but the subjective signs of the serpent, leprosy, and the blood. As called ones, we need some subjective experiences, some subjective evidences, to substantiate to others that we have truly been called by God and sent by Him. These evidences are the ability to deal with the Devil, the ability to deal with the sinful flesh, and the ability to deal with the death brought in by the world. Suppose a certain person comes to you claiming that he has been sent by God. If he does not know how to deal with Satan, the flesh, and the world, you should not believe that he is a sent one. The sign of a <span class="pg" data-page-id="87" id="87">[87]</span> burning thorn-bush is not adequate proof that one has been called by God. A sent one must be able to deal with the serpent, with leprosy, and with blood. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj9E73HIH4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> We have pointed out that Exodus is a book of pictures. What marvelous pictures are in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32129" data-verses="Exodus 4:1">chapter four</span>! In these pictures we see Satan, the sinful flesh, and the world of death. If we know how to deal with these things, then we are truly God’s sent ones. It is crucial that we all know the significance of the three subjective signs in this chapter and have such subjective experiences. </p>

<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4fsa407VCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> When God called Moses, Moses had a rod that he relied upon. Perhaps when he was talking to God, Moses, an elderly man, was leaning upon that rod. His rod was his support. Hence, the rod signifies what we rely upon. </p>

The Rod Being Cast on the Ground<br/>and Being Exposed That It Was the Serpent</h2><p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2hgjkmdlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> Moses was reluctant to accept God’s calling; he protested that the children of Israel would reject him and say that the Lord had not appeared to him. Therefore, God said to Moses concerning the rod, “Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32130" data-verses="Exodus 4:3">v. 3</span>). When the rod was cast to the ground, the serpent hiding there was exposed. Even before the rod was cast down, the serpent was already there, but in a very hidden way. The Bible reveals that the serpent always tries to hide himself in something, behind something, or under something. The rod Moses relied on was actually the serpent, Satan. In the eyes of Moses, the rod was simply a rod that he could lean upon, but in the eyes of God, it was the serpent, whose aim is to usurp man. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3j1iJ92EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> Anything we rely upon is a rod. For example, if a brother relies upon his job, that job becomes a rod to him. But to God the serpent is hidden in that job, because from his hiding place within the job, Satan, the serpent, seeks to usurp the <span class="pg" data-page-id="88" id="88">[88]</span> brother. We may rely upon many persons or things: our wife or husband, our parents, our children, our ability, our education, our property, our bank account. The Bible shows us that whatever we rely upon becomes the usurping serpent. Today Satan is usurping all of mankind by concealing himself within the rods that people rely upon. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9vDOvN1w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> Anyone who has been called by God must realize that anything we rely upon is a hiding place for the serpent. The usurping enemy of God may be concealed in any matter, any thing, or any person we rely upon. Throughout the years I have been learning to trust in the Lord and not to rely upon any kind of rod. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC4xU4-H5C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> Please note that God did not tell Moses to throw away his rod. Rather, He commanded Moses to cast it down in order that its true nature might be exposed. The point here is that whatever our rod may be—our husband or wife, our education, our job, our ability, our bank account—it needs to leave our hand temporarily. If the rod stays in our hand with the head on the top, the serpent will not be exposed. But if we cast it down, then we shall see with our own eyes that our rod is actually a serpent. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32131" data-verses="Exodus 4:3">Exodus 4:3</span> says that when Moses’ rod became a serpent, “Moses fled from before it.” That rod may have been in Moses’ possession for many years, and it may have been precious to him. But when it was cast down, it was no longer lovable to him because the serpent who had been concealed within it all the while was exposed. </p>

And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand.” The Lord wants us to cast our rods down, not to throw them away. Do not throw away your education or your savings—cast them down. After the hidden serpent has been exposed, we need to pick it up by the “tail.” This is the best way to deal with the serpent. If you take a serpent by the head, it <span class="pg" data-page-id="89" id="89">[89]</span> may bite you. But if you pick it up by the tail, it will lose its power and hang limp. </p>

In this message we shall consider how Aaron (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32152" data-verses="Exodus 4:10-16">4:10-16</span>) and Zipporah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32153" data-verses="Exodus 4:24-26">4:24-26</span>) are related to God’s calling of Moses. Without the portion concerning Aaron and Zipporah, God’s calling of Moses would not be complete. The record of the calling of Moses is found not only in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32154" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span>, but also in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32155" data-verses="Exodus 4:1">Exodus 4</span>. Hence, if we would understand the calling of Moses in full, we need to consider even the small portions of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32156" data-verses="Exodus 4:1">chapter four</span> as part of this calling. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIGNaIVxO3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32157" data-verses="Exodus 4:14">Exodus 4:14</span> says that “the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses.” Even after the signs in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32158" data-verses="Exodus 4:1">chapter four</span>, Moses was still reluctant to go along with the Lord. It seems to me that Moses should have said, “Lord, since You have called me and have given me these signs, I take Your word.” Nevertheless, Moses still told the Lord to send someone else. At this point the Lord became angry with him. When I was young, I could see the reason for the Lord’s anger on the one hand. But, on the other hand, I thought that the Lord was too great and that this situation was too small for His anger to be kindled against Moses. </p>

To be alone is to be individualistic, but to be sent forth with another is to be sent <span class="pg" data-page-id="98" id="98">[98]</span> according to the principle of the Body. Thus, to have Aaron as a match for Moses was according to the divine principle. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l_AkgIc8l6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> Although this was according to God’s principle, God did not simply tell Moses that he needed Aaron to match him. But if we read this portion carefully, we shall see that this was already in God’s heart. The whole of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32160" data-verses="Exodus 4:14">verse 14</span> says, “And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.” The Lord was hoping that Moses would realize his need for someone to match him. Although the Lord was ready to do this, He did not point this out to Moses until he himself became conscious of his need. The Lord is very wise. He may be willing to do a certain thing for us, but He often will not do anything until we realize our need. This principle has an application among us in the church life. Although you may realize that I need a certain thing, it is better for you not to tell me. Instead, you should wait until I realize my need. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9ImqplJQHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> If we are clear about what was in the Lord’s heart, we can understand why the Lord’s anger was kindled against Moses. Apparently this anger was unpleasant; actually it was sweet. Only those who are superficial will say that the Lord’s anger here was unkind. Those who have depth with the Lord will realize that it was pleasant. The anger here indicates a sweet, intimate, human fellowship. Some may wonder how it is possible for the Lord to have human fellowship. This was possible because the Lord appeared to Moses as the Angel of Jehovah, who was a type of Christ. Because Christ is God incarnated to be a man, He is mysterious. For this reason, it is rather difficult to understand the appearing of the Angel of Jehovah in the Old Testament. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32161" data-verses="Exodus 4:1">Exodus 4</span> the Lord talked to Moses as if He were a man speaking to another man. According to the record, the conversation was more like that between friends than like that between the almighty God and a human being. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGt-pBwZfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> This intimacy between the Lord and Moses can be compared to the intimacy between a man and his wife. <span class="pg" data-page-id="99" id="99">[99]</span> Sometimes a man is angry with his wife, but his expression of anger is sweet and pleasant. It is not the kind of anger that he would ever show toward anyone else; for it is an anger that expresses a sweet, intimate feeling. This is very similar to the feeling between the Lord and Moses here. The anger of the Lord toward Moses in this chapter is much different from His wrath toward Sodom. The anger in this instance is a pleasant anger between two intimate parties. After the Lord spoke to Moses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32162" data-verses="Exodus 4:11-12">verses 11 and 12</span>
, Moses replied, “O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32163" data-verses="Exodus 4:13">v. 13</span>). Moses’ word was not a harsh rejection of the Lord. On the contrary, it was an intimate expression of his personal feeling. Nevertheless, Moses’ response caused the Lord to be angry with him. His reaction forced the Lord, in His pleasant anger toward Moses, to open His heart regarding Aaron as Moses’ match. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPR_HkqvJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> In keeping with the divine principle, the Lord would not allow His servant to be individualistic. Moses needed Aaron. Hence, Aaron’s presence was not accidental. God had prepared him as a match for Moses. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnC5iuRr9fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> This principle of matching applies today. If you have been called by the Lord, you need to realize your need for someone to match you. We have pointed out that the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples two by two. When the Apostle Paul came out to serve the Lord, he did not behave individualistically. He always had others to match him. This is proved by the opening verse of 1 Corinthians: “Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother.” When Paul wrote this Epistle, neither Timothy nor Barnabas was present. Therefore, Paul took Sosthenes as a match; he took a brother whose name we hardly know in order to keep the principle. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJE8i00PaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> To act individualistically in the Lord’s service is not according to the divine principle. Today, in the New Testament economy, to be individualistic is to violate the principle of the Body. We should not behave individualistically; rather, we should move and act according to the principle of corporateness, always having at least one other member to match <span class="pg" data-page-id="100" id="100">[100]</span> us. The more members we have to match us, the better it is. The Body cannot be represented by individuals. According to the divine principle, the proper representation of the Body is always by those members who are matched with others. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-DwszsMx6qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> To be matched, however, is difficult. In the case of Moses and Aaron, the younger brother was the leader, and the elder was the follower. To be matched with anyone is difficult, to be matched to a brother in the flesh is more difficult, and to be matched in such a way that the younger is the leading one is most difficult. My younger brother was a dear brother in the Lord; he loved the Lord very much. When we were in mainland China, we were in the same local church. But I learned from experience that it was difficult to have him match me. Because Aaron was Moses’ elder brother in the flesh, it was very difficult for Moses to be matched with him. This might be one reason the Lord did not tell Moses that Aaron was to be his match until Moses had fully expressed himself to the Lord regarding his inability to answer His call. This gave the Lord the ground to tell Moses that Aaron would be his spokesman. The Lord had prepared Aaron for Moses, and, no matter how difficult it was, Moses had no choice except to take him as his match. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNFY94HDaKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32164" data-verses="Numbers 12:1">Numbers 12</span> there is recorded an incident involving Aaron and Miriam which shows how difficult it was for Moses to be matched by Aaron. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32165" data-verses="Numbers 12:1">Verse 1</span> of this chapter says, “And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.” This indicates how difficult it was for Miriam and Aaron, both of whom were older than Moses, to take Moses as the leader. His mistake in marrying the Ethiopian woman gave Miriam and Aaron the opportunity to speak against him. Their speaking here was not accidental; rather, it was an expression of what was already within them. How hard it was for Moses to take the lead over his sister and brother! The Lord certainly arranged a difficult situation for him. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQa1QdsxiwajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg">THE COMPLETE VIEW OF GOD’S CALL OF MOSES</h1><p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755Xw-TLmu9jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> In this message we need to see the complete view of God’s call of Moses. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32174" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">chapters three and four</span> of Exodus, this call covers five points: the burning thorn-bush, the revelation of who God is and of what God is, the purpose of God’s calling, the three signs, and Aaron’s matching and Zipporah’s cutting. We shall consider the purpose of God’s calling in the next message; in this message we shall look at the other four aspects of God’s calling. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGuDjw-TOPzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> Firstly, Moses saw the vision of a thorn-bush that burned without being consumed. Such a vision was unique. After Moses beheld the burning thorn-bush, God revealed Himself to him. The unveiling of God’s name was actually the revelation of God Himself. No other portion of the Word affords us as clear and profound a revelation of the divine name as the third chapter of Exodus. God said to Moses that His name was “I AM THAT I AM.” This indicates that God’s name here is a form of the verb <em>to be.</em> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32175" data-verses="Revelation 1:8">Revelation 1:8</span> says that the Lord God is “He who is, and who was, and who is coming.” Furthermore, God told Moses that He was the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. This title reveals that God is not only the God of being, of existence, but that He is also the God of resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJnv_KBZPAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32176" data-verses="Exodus 4:1">chapter four</span> Moses was given three signs: the sign of the rod becoming a serpent, the sign of the hand becoming leprous, and the sign of the water becoming blood. Toward the end of this chapter he received the male help and the female help. The male help, afforded by Aaron, was the matching, and the female help, provided by Zipporah, was the cutting. This cutting caused Moses to be a “bloody husband,” a man under the sentence of death. Only after <span class="pg" data-page-id="110" id="110">[110]</span> Moses had received these two kinds of help was God’s calling of him complete. By then Moses was useful to the Lord and was fully prepared to carry out God’s commission. If we see this complete view of God’s calling, a view that reaches from the vision of the burning thorn-bush to Zipporah’s cutting, we shall be deeply impressed. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqH6hB-nyUXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR">I. THE BURNING THORN-BUSH</h2><p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2GzM4RSr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> When Moses was called by God, he saw the great sight of a burning thorn-bush. We have pointed out that the burning thorn-bush refers to God’s redeemed people. Once we were thorns under the curse in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32177" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32178" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span> we are a redeemed thorn-bush. Now God is burning within us and upon us. This burning thorn-bush is both the children of Israel in the Old Testament and the church in the New Testament. In the church today there are still “thorns”; the church is not yet precious stone. Nevertheless, we praise the Lord that we are undergoing the process of transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7TmJuYeKO1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32179" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:16">Deuteronomy 33:16</span> Moses spoke of God as the One who dwelt in the thorn-bush. This word was uttered when Moses was one hundred twenty years of age, forty years after he had seen the vision of the burning thorn-bush. Moses never forgot that vision, even after the tabernacle had been built and God had come to dwell in it. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32180" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:16">Deuteronomy 33:16</span> why did not Moses speak of the good will of “Him who dwelt in the tabernacle”? I believe that for Moses to speak of God dwelling in the tabernacle would not have been as sweet as it was for him to speak of God dwelling in the thorn-bush. I believe that even when we are in the New Jerusalem we shall recall how we once were a thorn-bush indwelt by God. How marvelous that a thorn-bush can be God’s dwelling place on earth today! </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9uBOvN3w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> All the way from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32181" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span> through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32182" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span> we can trace the line concerning God’s dwelling place. God’s ultimate goal is to obtain a dwelling place. This means that God’s eternal purpose is to build up His habitation. In Genesis we have the revelation of the house of God at Bethel, but we do not have the actual building of the house of God. At <span class="pg" data-page-id="111" id="111">[111]</span> the beginning of Exodus God dwelt in the thorn-bush, but at the end of the book He dwelt in the tabernacle. The tabernacle with the ark thus became the focal point of the history of the children of Israel. Eventually, the tabernacle was enlarged into the temple. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC4wW4-H7C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> The Lord Jesus came both as God’s tabernacle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32183" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>) and as God’s temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32184" data-verses="John 2:19">John 2:19</span>). The church today is also the temple of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32185" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:16">1 Cor. 3:16</span>). Ultimately, this temple will consummate in the New Jerusalem, which will be God’s temple in eternity. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTbIBwBDXVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> In the beginning God’s dwelling place was a redeemed thorn-bush, but gradually this thorn-bush is being sanctified, transformed, conformed, and even glorified. The tabernacle is an illustration of transformation. In the tabernacle there were acacia wood overlaid with gold and also linen embroidered with golden thread. Both the acacia wood and the linen signify humanity, and the gold signifies divinity. Such an overlaid and embroidered humanity is a transformed humanity. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32186" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span> God’s dwelling was a thorn-bush, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32187" data-verses="Exodus 40:1">Exodus 40</span> His dwelling was the tabernacle made of humanity overlaid by and interwoven with divinity. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8FLu1K3xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> Both the thorn-bush and the tabernacle are symbols. God’s actual dwelling place was neither the physical thorn-bush nor the tabernacle; it was His people. After the children of Israel had been dealt with by God, they became acacia wood overlaid with gold and also linen embroidered with golden thread. The church today is the fulfillment of this type. At present the church may be a redeemed thorn-bush. However, the day is coming when we shall be gold, pearl, and precious stone. Praise the Lord for the marvelous vision of God’s dwelling place! This vision covers God’s habitation from the initial stage, the stage of the thorn-bush, to the consummate stage, the stage of the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m5HK4CMpyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> When Moses was called by God, he saw the holy fire burning within the thorn-bush. When Paul was called, he saw the same vision, at least in principle. He saw the Triune God burning within His redeemed ones. Through this divine <span class="pg" data-page-id="112" id="112">[112]</span> burning, the holy fire was one with the thorn-bush, and the thorn-bush was one with the fire, which is the Triune God Himself. Today God the Father in the Son and the Son as the Spirit have come down upon us as fire. The Lord Jesus once said that He came to cast fire upon the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32188" data-verses="Luke 12:49">Luke 12:49</span>). On the day of Pentecost the Spirit came in the form of tongues of fire. Today the Lord is still casting fire upon the earth. This holy fire, this divine burning, has captured us, and now we are part of the thorn-bush that is burning with the Triune God. The Triune God is burning within and upon the church He has chosen and redeemed. Thus, the church is the Triune God burning within a redeemed humanity. This is the divine economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32189" data-verses="1Timothy 1:4">1 Tim. 1:4</span>, Gk.). </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh92PqmPovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> This economy was revealed to Paul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32190" data-verses="Ephesians 3:3-5">Eph. 3:3-5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32191" data-verses="Ephesians 3:9">9</span>). It is, in fact, the focus of the divine revelation. Moses saw this in symbol, but Paul saw it in reality. How we praise the Lord that His economy has also been unveiled to us! We boldly proclaim that we have seen the vision of the burning thorn-bush. Every local church is a thorn-bush burning with the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-2L9kYe089qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> I have been asked why I am so persistent and unchanging concerning God’s economy and its accomplishment in the local churches today. The answer is that I have seen the heavenly vision. Moses and Paul could not forget the vision they had seen. Paul’s Epistles reveal that nothing, including imprisonment and martyrdom, could turn him from the vision. Paul was steadfast unto the end because he had been captured by the heavenly vision. The death of those martyred for the Lord can only cause the thorn-bush to burn more than ever. </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB5KJSfIj6RI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> Thousands of us today have seen the vision of the burning bush, and no one can change us. We cannot even change ourselves. If we try to turn away from the vision, the vision does not let us go. We have been “wrecked” by the vision we have seen. In these days I have become fully convinced that nothing can shake the saints in the Lord’s recovery. Shaking only makes them more absolute. Many have testified that they cannot turn away from the vision of the church in God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="113" id="113">[113]</span> economy. The opposers should realize that it is too late to stand against the Lord’s recovery because so many have seen the vision of the burning thorn-bush. Hallelujah for the vision of the Triune God burning within the church! </p>

Do not think, as many do, that Moses is vastly superior to us. Most Christians regard Moses as the highest servant of God in the Old Testament and Paul as the highest in the New Testament. Comparing themselves with Moses and Paul, they have a very low estimate of themselves. This attitude is mistaken. God’s calling of us is the same in principle as His calling of Moses and Paul. What Moses experienced in type, Paul experienced in reality. Today both the type and the reality should be our experience also. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-DwtxsM1paQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> In the Life-study of Ephesians we pointed out that all the saints can be perfected to do the work of apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Just as a mathematics teacher perfects his students to do what he can do, so the leading ones perfect the saints to do the very things that they themselves do. Paul was a representative of the members of the Body of Christ. No matter how great Paul was, he was still just one member of the Body. In principle, what he was able to do, all the other members should be able to do also. This indicates that all the members should be called as Paul was called. For this reason, we all must know the purpose of God’s calling. </p>

Pharaoh was a type of Satan, and Egypt was a type of the world. Just as Pharaoh was the ruler of Egypt, so Satan is the ruler of this world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32213" data-verses="John 12:31">John 12:31</span>). God <span class="pg" data-page-id="122" id="122">[122]</span> is still seeking to deliver His chosen people out of the usurping hand of Satan and out of the tyranny of the world. As God’s called ones, we need a clear view of what the world is. The world is not a source of enjoyment; it is a place of tyranny. In the world Satan is keeping God’s chosen people, those destined for the fulfillment of God’s purpose, under his usurping hand. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoaTNLW65tP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> Every aspect of the world is a form of tyranny. In Exodus Pharaoh kept the children of Israel under tyranny by forcing them to do hard labor. The same principle operates today. As people work, they suffer under various forms of tyranny. Even making a long drive to work on a crowded freeway is one kind of tyranny. Likewise, the competition for promotion and the insecurity about losing a job are also kinds of tyranny. Nevertheless, anyone who does not labor for Pharaoh in the world will not receive the supply of the Nile. In order to earn a living in the world, God’s chosen people must serve under the tyranny of Pharaoh. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVMjnNMZne1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> Shopping is another form of the world’s tyranny. Many young women are held in tyranny in a subtle way through shopping for the latest fashions. </p>

As we shall see, Moses did not preach to the children of Israel, but he was able to rescue them from Pharaoh. Today we also need to have the authority to bring God’s people out of the usurping hand of Satan. One aspect of God’s purpose in His calling is to use us to bring others out of the usurpation and tyranny of Satan and the world. </p>

Elsewhere in the Bible the term <em>wilderness</em> is not a positive term. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32215" data-verses="Exodus 3:18">3:18</span> it is used in a positive sense, for here the wilderness is opposed to the world. It is the place of separation from the world. As soon as one is saved, he should be brought out of the world into the wilderness where there is no Egyptian element. When the children of Israel entered into the wilderness, they were set free from Egypt. In the same principle, if we would get out of the world, we must get into the wilderness. However, not many Christians have been brought into the wilderness. This means that some have been saved, but have not been delivered from the world and separated from it. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTN0gBVRcNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> As a young man who was altogether in the world, I was full of ambition regarding my future. But when I was saved, I was saved not only from the lake of fire, but also saved from the world. On the day I was saved, all the worldly elements fell away from me, and I was brought into the wilderness. We need to pray that the Lord will grant us the ability to bring His children out of the world and into the wilderness. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5YT5lOcEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32216" data-verses="Exodus 3:18">3:18</span>, Moses and the elders of Israel were to say to the king of Egypt, “The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.” In the Bible three days signifies resurrection. A complete and perfect salvation must involve a three days’ journey, that is, a journey in resurrection. In our preaching of the gospel, there must be the power of resurrection. However, our gospel preaching today is short of impact. People can listen to our preaching and even repent and receive the Lord, but still remain in their tombs in Egypt. We need to have the power of resurrection in our preaching so that others are raised out of their tombs and brought into the wilderness by a journey of three days. Such a journey is signified by baptism. Every believer in Christ must be baptized to bear witness to the fact that he is leaving the world and is entering into another realm in resurrection. <span class="pg" data-page-id="124" id="124">[124]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FbVH3mSwPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> We must pray that our ministry of the Word will have impact. We do not want to give mere knowledge to people. Rather, we desire that something in our preaching will touch their hearts and cause them to leave the world and journey into the wilderness in resurrection. </p>

TO BRING GOD’S CHOSEN PEOPLE<br/>TO THE MOUNTAIN TO SERVE GOD<br/>AND TO SACRIFICE TO HIM</h2><p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjiaMNXNmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32217" data-verses="Exodus 3:12">3:12</span> the Lord told Moses, “When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.” This indicates that the purpose of God’s calling is also to bring His chosen people to the mountain, where they may serve Him and sacrifice to Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32218" data-verses="Exodus 3:18">3:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32219" data-verses="Exodus 19:1-2">19:1-2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32220" data-verses="Exodus 19:11">11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32221" data-verses="Exodus 24:16-18">24:16-18</span>). Many Christians have never entered into the wilderness, much less come to the mountain. They are truly saved, because they believe in the Lord Jesus and they have been washed in His blood. However, they are still in Egypt. Others have come out of Egypt into the wilderness, but they have not come to the mountain. The divine revelation concerning God’s purpose was given to Moses on the mountain. The law was given to Moses there. It was also on the mountain that he received the revelation concerning the design of the tabernacle. Although most of the children of Israel did not actually ascend to the top of the mountain, they were nonetheless camped close to the mountain. Moses, Aaron, and more than seventy others went up to the mountain to meet with God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32222" data-verses="Exodus 24:1">24:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32223" data-verses="Exodus 24:9">9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD7rDasbW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> The mountain in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32224" data-verses="Exodus 3:12">3:12</span> refers to an elevation in the wilderness. Not only do we need to be separated from the world, but in this realm of separation we need to ascend to an elevated place. Only when we are on such a high level can we receive the revelation regarding God’s eternal purpose. </p>

In God’s call the chosen people were directed to three different stations. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32246" data-verses="Exodus 3:18">Verse 18</span> says that the children of Israel were to take a “three days’ journey into the wilderness.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32247" data-verses="Exodus 3:12">verse 12</span> the Lord said to Moses, “Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.” Finally, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32248" data-verses="Exodus 3:8">verses 8</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32249" data-verses="Exodus 3:17">17</span> the Lord promised Moses that He would bring the children of Israel out of Egypt into a “land flowing with milk and honey.” Therefore, the three stations spoken of in this chapter are the wilderness, the mountain, and the land. </p>

TO THE WILDERNESS</h2><p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjia8NQdGh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> Many Christian teachers have emphasized the importance of the experience of the children of Israel in the wilderness. However, they interpret the wilderness as a place of test and trial. Although elsewhere in the Bible the wilderness has this significance, this is not the meaning of the wilderness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32250" data-verses="Exodus 3:18">3:18</span>. Here the wilderness denotes a place of separation from the world. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32251" data-verses="Exodus 3:18">3:18</span>, the children of Israel were to make a journey of three days into the wilderness so that they might sacrifice to the Lord their God. It was impossible for God’s people to sacrifice to Him in Egypt. In order to serve God in this way, they had to be in a place of separation. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD7rzaqLm2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> The wilderness was separated from Egypt by the Red <span class="pg" data-page-id="134" id="134">[134]</span> Sea. The crossing of the Red Sea is a type of baptism. After we believed in the Lord Jesus and took Him as our Passover, we were baptized. Thus, the water of baptism separates us from the world and brings us into the wilderness where we can serve God. However, many saved ones have not yet been delivered into the wilderness. This means that although they have been saved, they have not been separated from the world. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzINLMDQ1RdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> The wilderness, the place of separation from the world, is the first station in God’s deliverance of His chosen people from Egypt. Our experience testifies to this. Before we were saved, we were very much occupied with the things of the world. But God’s salvation has delivered us from this preoccupation and has brought us into the wilderness. Everyone who is properly saved must have this kind of experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqY_B6MOT0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> This is seen both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament. The only difference is that the Old Testament presents the type, the picture, whereas the New Testament presents the spiritual reality in words. Because it is often difficult for us to grasp the spiritual things in the New Testament, God in His wisdom uses the pictures in the Old Testament to help us understand them. The history of the children of Israel is a portrait of a believer’s full salvation. For example, the Passover is a type of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32252" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:7">1 Corinthians 5:7</span> Paul says, “Our Passover, Christ, has been sacrificed.” Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32253" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:1-2">1 Corinthians 10:1 and 2</span> Paul indicates that the crossing of the Red Sea is a type of baptism. In addition, the manna and the water from the cleft rock are also types of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32254" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:3-4">1 Cor. 10:3-4</span>). It is not difficult to see the significance of these types; however, hardly any Christians realize that the good land is also a type of Christ. Hence, many regard only the beginning stage of the history of the children of Israel as a type. How we thank the Lord for showing us that the whole history of the Israelites is a portrait of our salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZUyD8-EcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> The children of Israel came out of Egypt and into the wilderness by the enjoyment of the Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32255" data-verses="Exodus 12:11">12:11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32256" data-verses="Exodus 12:31-41">31-41</span>) and through the baptism in the Red Sea (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32257" data-verses="Exodus 14:21-30">14:21-30</span>). To them, <span class="pg" data-page-id="135" id="135">[135]</span> the Passover was an enjoyment; they enjoyed the lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs. The supply they received through this enjoyment strengthened them to walk out of Egypt. Furthermore, the baptism in the Red Sea delivered them from the Egyptians. This indicates that by Christ as the Passover Lamb and by His death we are separated from the world and brought into the wilderness, the first station in fulfilling God’s purpose. </p>

TO THE MOUNTAIN</h2><p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cB1oO1TYwWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> The second station is the mountain (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32258" data-verses="Exodus 3:12">3:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32259" data-verses="Exodus 19:1-2">19:1-2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32260" data-verses="Exodus 19:11">11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32261" data-verses="Exodus 24:16-18">24:16-18</span>), where the children of Israel received revelation concerning God and concerning the tabernacle. For hundreds of years they had been under darkness in Egypt where there was no light, no word, and no speaking of God. But now, under the enlightenment, they were to live according to the revelation concerning God, and they were to build the tabernacle according to the pattern revealed by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTj5OAE5AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> The children of Israel were brought to the mountain by the tree which made the bitter water sweet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32262" data-verses="Exodus 15:23-25">15:23-25</span>), by the twelve springs of water at Elim (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32263" data-verses="Exodus 15:27">15:27</span>), by the manna from heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32264" data-verses="Exodus 16:14-15">16:14-15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32265" data-verses="Exodus 16:31-32">31-32</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32266" data-verses="Exodus 16:35">35</span>), by the living water from the cleft rock (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32267" data-verses="Exodus 17:6">17:6</span>), and by the victory over Amalek (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32268" data-verses="Exodus 17:8-16">17:8-16</span>). When the Israelites came to Marah, “they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32269" data-verses="Exodus 15:23">15:23</span>). Because the people murmured against him, Moses cried to the Lord, “and the Lord showed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32270" data-verses="Exodus 15:25">15:25</span>). This tree signifies Christ with His cross. The children of Israel went on to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32271" data-verses="Exodus 15:27">15:27</span>), and they camped there by the waters. When they journeyed onward from Elim, they murmured again; this time it was because they had no food. God met their need by sending down manna, the heavenly food, to support them. Likewise, when the children of Israel murmured because there was no water, God brought forth living water from the cleft rock (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32272" data-verses="Exodus 17:1-6">17:1-6</span>). All these items signify various aspects of Christ as our life supply, the very <span class="pg" data-page-id="136" id="136">[136]</span> supply God uses to bring us to the mountain. We in the local churches can testify that we have been supplied by the sweet water, by the twelve springs at Elim, by the heavenly manna, and by the living water flowing from the cleft rock. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd86-66zFfZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> God’s chosen people were not to stay at the mountain in the wilderness. God’s intention was that they journey onward into the good land. Likewise, today we should remain neither in the wilderness nor on the mountain. Rather, we should regard both as temporary stopping places. Our ultimate destination is the good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIHPqIRi-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> In their experience not many Christians have come to the mountain. Many of us can testify that before we came into the church life, we were not at the mountain, the place of revelation. Most of the saints in the Lord’s recovery, however, have come to the mountain in the wilderness. On the one hand, it is a wonderful experience to be at the mountain; on the other hand, it is a cause of suffering if we remain there a long time. Some who have been in Christ for many years have not gone further than the station of the mountain. On the fourteenth day of the first month, the children of Israel celebrated the Passover in Egypt, and during the third month they arrived at the mountain (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32273" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">19:1</span>). They stayed there for approximately nine months. By the first day of the next year, the tabernacle had been built and was filled with glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32274" data-verses="Exodus 40:17">40:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32275" data-verses="Exodus 40:34">34</span>). This indicates that it is not normal to remain at the mountain for too long a time. Many of us in the Lord’s recovery have seen the revelation on the mountain and have shared with others in the building of the tabernacle. Although this is wonderful, it is wonderful only in a temporary way. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbALPNgI6HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> If we consider the picture of the children of Israel in the wilderness, we see that only two of those who came out of Egypt—Joshua and Caleb—entered into the good land. All the others, including Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, died in the wilderness. To them, the wilderness was not only a place of separation, but also a place of test and trial. Before the children of Israel came to the mountain, the wilderness was positive, for it was just a place of separation. But after the <span class="pg" data-page-id="137" id="137">[137]</span> mountain, the wilderness became a place of test and trial because of their unbelief. </p>

<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4bpa-AwKTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32305" data-verses="Exodus 5:1">Exodus 5:1</span> says, “And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness” (Heb.). In this verse we have an important title of God: Jehovah, God of Israel. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32306" data-verses="Exodus 5:3">verse 3</span> God is entitled the God of the Hebrews. Hence, the demand on Pharaoh was made by Jehovah, the God of Israel, the God of the Hebrews. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj9F5HHAVIFazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> We have pointed out that in Hebrew the title Jehovah is a form of the verb <em>to be</em>. This indicates that Jehovah is the unique self-existing One. He is the One who was, who is, and who will be. Only to Him can the verb “to be” be applied in an absolute sense. Only God is; we and all other things are not. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32307" data-verses="Exodus 6:3">6:3</span> God says, “I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God All-sufficient; but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them” (Heb.). God revealed Himself as Jehovah for the first time in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32308" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span>. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did not receive this revelation of Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="146" id="146">[146]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjiasNXPmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32309" data-verses="Exodus 5:1">5:1</span> God is also called the God of Israel. This title is different from the title the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, a title which signifies God as the God of resurrection. The title the God of Israel indicates that God is the God of a transformed people. Jacob was the name of a natural man, but Israel was the name of a transformed man. At birth, Jacob was not given the name Israel. Rather, he was called Jacob, which means a heel-holder, a supplanter. But throughout the course of his life, Jacob was transformed, and eventually God changed his name to Israel. This name implies victory and kingship. On the one hand, the transformed people are victors; on the other hand, they are kings. Even when the children of Israel were in a dreadful situation in Egypt, God still regarded them not as Jacob, but as Israel. In the eyes of God, His chosen people had already been transformed into victors and kings. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD7rjasZW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> The same principle applies to the way God sees the church today. In the eyes of God, the church is already glorious. However, if our eyes are set on our spiritual condition, we may regard ourselves as being very pitiful. We may see ourselves as Jacob, not as Israel. Nevertheless, as God sees us, we are Israel. In His dealings with Satan, the persecutor and usurper, God told him that He is the God of a transformed, victorious, and kingly people. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzINLMTQ8DdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> We all need to see and believe that we are an Israel. You may not believe this today, but you will certainly believe it in the future, either in the next age or in eternity. In eternity all God’s chosen people will be an Israel. Do not be shortsighted, limited in your vision by your present situation. God does not regard you as one still in bondage under Pharaoh; rather, He sees you as one who has been delivered and brought into the all-inclusive Christ typified by the good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqY_R6EcD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> Do you dare believe that you are such an Israel, such a victor and king? We all must be bold enough to believe this and to declare it. Do not hold to your feeling regarding yourself, but believe in the word of God. If God says that you are <span class="pg" data-page-id="147" id="147">[147]</span> an Israel, then you are an Israel, whether you feel this way about yourself or not. </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36RBFLLMBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> Yes, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32310" data-verses="Exodus 5:1">chapter five</span> of Exodus the children of Israel were still under bondage in Egypt. However, God knew that they soon would be delivered from this bondage and brought into the wilderness, to the mountain, and eventually into the land of Canaan. In the good land they would be Israel, and God would be their God. Therefore, as God came to Pharaoh to negotiate with him, He was not disappointed by the condition of His people. He did not have Moses and Aaron tell Pharaoh that He was the God of Jacob. Instead, He let Pharaoh know that He was Jehovah, the God of Israel. It seemed as if God were saying, “Pharaoh, you must realize that I Am. I am He who was, who is, and who will be. You cannot change Me. Furthermore, in My sight, My people have been transformed into an Israel. They also are Hebrews, river-crossers. Because they are Hebrews, don’t try to keep them on this side of the Red Sea. I am Jehovah, and whatever I say must come to pass. I say that My people are Hebrews; therefore, they are Hebrews. You cannot keep them in Egypt. You must let them go.” </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0Izx29KYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> The titles of God mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32311" data-verses="Exodus 5:1">chapter five</span> are extremely important. Even in diplomatic relations among the nations of the world, titles are of great significance. If a representative of a certain nation is to negotiate with the government of the United States, he must have a proper title. If he were simply a consul or minister, his position would not be high enough. He would need to bear the title of ambassador. Then he could engage in diplomatic negotiations. In the same principle, as God was negotiating with Pharaoh, He presented Himself according to the proper title: Jehovah, the God of Israel, the God of the Hebrews. He let Pharaoh know that He was the great I Am. As the I Am, He was everything, and Pharaoh was nothing. Moreover, He revealed Himself to Pharaoh as the God of Israel, the God of a people transformed to be victors and kings. As the One with such a marvelous title, God made His demand of Pharaoh. <span class="pg" data-page-id="148" id="148">[148]</span> </p>

To Let His People Go<br/> That They May Hold a Feast unto Him<br/>in the Wilderness</h2><p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2TQhwzAoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> God’s demand of Pharaoh is seen in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32312" data-verses="Exodus 5:1">5:1</span>. Speaking on behalf of the Lord, Moses and Aaron said to Pharaoh, “Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.” The feast is in contrast with slavery, with rigorous labor. Jehovah was telling Pharaoh to release His people from slavery so that they could hold a feast unto Him. The words “unto me” in this verse indicate that when God’s people are feasting, He is happy. Their feasting is unto Him. It seems that Jehovah was telling Pharaoh, “I am not happy to see My people under slavery in Egypt. Let them go so that they may feast to make Me happy. I like to see My people feasting and rejoicing. I am glad when they do nothing but eat and rejoice. That is a feast unto Me.” </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zGuhavwSXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> This feasting unto the Lord is dispensational worship; that is, it is worshipping God according to what has been dispensed into us. As we eat, drink, praise, sing, and rejoice in the presence of God, we hold a feast unto Him. As we shall see, such a feast is also a sacrifice unto the Lord. To sacrifice is to worship. Dispensational worship is worship in which God is dispensed into us for our enjoyment so that we may feast in His presence with Him and unto Him. This is the worship God desires. This is not only revealed in the New Testament, but also implied in the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgcD4vSKvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> We may consider the feast here a festival, a holiday, or a holy day, a time for God’s people to rest with God and to enjoy God’s provision with God. Three times a year God ordained special periods of feasting for the Israelites. The three main festivals were the Passover, including the feast of unleavened bread; the feast of weeks (Pentecost); and the feast of tabernacles. At those times the people were not allowed to do any work; anyone who worked on those festival days would be cut off from God’s people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32313" data-verses="Leviticus 23:30">Lev. 23:30</span>). This feasting pleased the Lord because it was worship to Him. According to the human concept, people should always be working; but according to the divine concept, God’s people <span class="pg" data-page-id="149" id="149">[149]</span> should put aside their working for the times of festivals to rest from their busyness and to feast with God in worship to Him. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32334" data-verses="Exodus 6:1-8">6:1-8</span> God gave Moses a strong word concerning His name and His covenant.

El Shaddai</h2><p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8FKu1Clhnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32335" data-verses="Exodus 6:3">6:3</span> God said to Moses, “I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God All-sufficient; but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them” (Heb.). For years I was puzzled by this verse. I knew that according to certain verses in Genesis, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were all familiar with the name Jehovah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32336" data-verses="Genesis 12:4">Gen. 12:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32337" data-verses="Genesis 26:25">26:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32338" data-verses="Genesis 32:9">32:9</span>). How can we reconcile these verses with the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32339" data-verses="Exodus 6:3">6:3</span>? The answer rests in the fact that it is one thing to know a particular name and it is another thing to know God by that very name. For example, people all over the world know the name of Jesus. However, not all those who know this name also know the Lord by this name. To know the name of Jesus is one thing, but to know the Lord Jesus in an experiential way by His name is another. Jesus means Jehovah the Savior. People may be familiar with the <span class="pg" data-page-id="162" id="162">[162]</span> name of Jesus, but they may have no experience of Jehovah the Savior. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYMBDIJAazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> This was my situation before I was saved. I was born into Christianity, and my mother taught me the story of Jesus. I even spoke of Jesus to others, and I defended Christianity against attack. However, I myself had no experience of Jesus as Jehovah the Savior. I knew the name, but I did not yet know the Lord by that name. In the same principle, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob knew the name Jehovah, but they did not know God by this name. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l-D0gAOMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> However, they did know the Lord as God All-sufficient, that is, as El Shaddai. <em>El</em> means the mighty One, and <em>Shaddai</em> implies the meaning of breast or udder. Hence, this divine title indicates that God is strong and all-sufficient. As such a One, He is the supplying God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32340" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Gen. 17:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32341" data-verses="Genesis 28:3">28:3</span>) and the promising God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32342" data-verses="Genesis 35:11">Gen. 35:11</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBhuT7yNFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s">C. Jehovah</h2><p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Bltzj9qck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> Just as El Shaddai is God’s name for supply and promise, so Jehovah is His name for existence and fulfillment. As Jehovah, God is the existing God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32343" data-verses="Exodus 3:14">Exo. 3:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32344" data-verses="John 8:24">John 8:24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32345" data-verses="John 8:28">28</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32346" data-verses="John 8:58">58</span>) and the fulfilling God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32347" data-verses="Exodus 6:6-8">Exo. 6:6-8</span>). Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob died without enjoying the fulfillment of the promise (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32348" data-verses="Hebrews 11:13">Heb. 11:13</span>). In their experience God was the all-sufficient One, but He was not Jehovah. To them, He was the promising God, but He was not the fulfilling God. When God spoke to Moses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32349" data-verses="Exodus 6:1-8">6:1-8</span>, He did not speak as El Shaddai, the promising God, but as Jehovah, the fulfilling God. Here God did not make a promise to Moses regarding the good land; rather, He came to fulfill the promise He had made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. When God was making a covenant with Abraham in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32350" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">Genesis 15</span>, He indicated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32351" data-verses="Genesis 15:13-14">verses 13 and 14</span> that it would be four hundred years before the promise concerning the good land would be fulfilled. These years were completed when Moses was eighty years of age. This indicates that what was a promise to Abraham was to be a fulfillment to Moses and to the children of Israel. Therefore, <span class="pg" data-page-id="163" id="163">[163]</span> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32352" data-verses="Exodus 6:1">chapter six</span> God came to Moses and to the children of Israel, not as God All-sufficient, but as Jehovah. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GlZ16fsZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> In order for God to be the fulfilling God, He must be the existing God; that is, He must be the self-existing One. In a unique sense, the verb <em>to be</em> is applied only to Him. This verb is a basic component of the name Jehovah. In this universe He alone is the self-existing One. As the One who promised, He is El Shaddai; but as the One who fulfills what He has promised, He is Jehovah, the One who is. God’s existence is not dependent on anything apart from Himself. He exists eternally, having neither beginning nor ending. As Jehovah, God simply is. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQa1RdszxAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> Approximately four thousand years ago, God made a promise to Abraham concerning the good land. God’s promise has not yet been fulfilled to Abraham himself, because Abraham has not been resurrected. If God were not the self-existing One and the ever-existing One, the promise made thousands of years ago could not be fulfilled. However, because God is and always will be, He cannot fail to fulfill His promise. In this universe there is One who is, and this One is the fulfilling God. Whatever He says will come to pass. Jehovah will fulfill His word. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755Xw_TLj99jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob experienced God as the supplying God and as the promising God. They knew Him by the name El Shaddai. But because they did not receive the fulfillment of the promise, they did not know Him by the name Jehovah, although, as we have pointed out, they did know this name. They died in faith without having received the fulfillment of what was promised. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32353" data-verses="Exodus 6:1">Exodus 6</span> God came in to fulfill His promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For this reason, God said to Moses, “I am Jehovah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32354" data-verses="Exodus 6:2">6:2</span>, Heb.). This means that God spoke to Moses and, through him, to the children of Israel as Jehovah, as the One who is. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGuCjw6AePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> For years I had difficulty understanding <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32355" data-verses="John 8:1">John 8</span>. Three times in this chapter the Lord refers to Himself as “I am” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32356" data-verses="John 8:24">vv. 24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32357" data-verses="John 8:28">28</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32358" data-verses="John 8:58">58</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32359" data-verses="John 8:58">verse 58</span> the Lord Jesus declared, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham came into being, I am.” As the great I Am, the Lord is the eternal, ever-existing God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="164" id="164">[164]</span> Hence, He is before Abraham. Spiritually speaking, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32360" data-verses="John 8:1">John 8</span> can be compared to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32361" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span>, where the Lord reveals Himself to Moses as the I Am (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32362" data-verses="Exodus 3:14">v. 14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJnu_KGJvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> We have pointed out that the name of Jesus means Jehovah the Savior. It does not mean El Shaddai the Savior. The One who came to be our Savior is the ever-existing One, the One who is. He came to fulfill all the promises made by God to His people. Therefore, Jesus came not to promise, but to fulfill. This means that He came not as El Shaddai, but as Jehovah. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqH6gB-hikXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> In the same principle, God came to Moses as Jehovah, not as El Shaddai. It seems as if the Lord were saying, “Moses, your forefathers knew Me by the name El Shaddai. But now I want you to know Me and to experience Me by another name—by the name Jehovah, the name of the One who is. Whatever I have promised, I shall fulfill.” </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2GyM4bAL6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> The Lord spoke this way to Moses because Moses had complained to Him about the result of his negotiation with Pharaoh. Moses had told Him that Pharaoh had done evil to the people. Furthermore, Moses said, “Neither hast thou delivered thy people at all” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32363" data-verses="Exodus 5:23">5:23</span>). Therefore, God told Moses that He was Jehovah. He desired that Moses and all the children of Israel know Him by this name and that they experience Him as the existing God and as the fulfilling God. As the Lord was encouraging Moses, it seems as if He were saying, “Moses, don’t be troubled or discouraged. You need to realize that I am here not only as El Shaddai, but as Jehovah. It is time for you to experience Me as the I Am. As Jehovah, the ever-existing One, I shall fulfill My covenant.” When God came to Moses, He came not as El Shaddai, but as Jehovah. He came not to promise, but to fulfill what had already been promised. Therefore, there was no need for Moses to be disappointed or discouraged. God had come into his situation as the existing and fulfilling One. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7TmIuYVY-1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> This should not merely be doctrine to us; it should become our experience in a practical way. In the Lord’s recovery today we are not in the stage of promise; we are in the stage of fulfillment. The stage of fulfillment includes the <span class="pg" data-page-id="165" id="165">[165]</span> fulfillment of the promises made both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament. One New Testament promise is the Lord’s word, “I will build My church” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32364" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matt. 16:18</span>). This word is being fulfilled among us today. This indicates that we are experiencing the Lord not only as El Shaddai, but also as Jehovah. </p>

After the first conflict with Pharaoh, Moses felt that he had failed. God had sent him to speak His word to Pharaoh. However, instead of hearkening to this word, Pharaoh became even more evil in his treatment of the children of Israel, and the people complained to Moses. Moses, feeling defeated, complained to the Lord, saying, “Wherefore hast thou so badly treated this people? Why is it that thou hast sent me? For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32376" data-verses="Exodus 5:22-23">5:22-23</span>, Heb.). Moses’ reaction indicated that he needed further training. God would not send him to Pharaoh again until he had received more training from Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-YPgcPi4s4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> We have pointed out that God’s calling of Moses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32377" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">chapters three and four</span> of this book is the most complete call in the Bible. At the time He called Moses, God spent much time with him, and Moses received both revelation and instruction. He took God’s word and did all that God had charged him to do. However, things did not turn out as Moses expected. To his surprise, he was defeated, Pharaoh was victorious, and the children of Israel suffered all the more. This was the reason he complained to the Lord about the situation. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cB1oPFTfiWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> In His further training of Moses, the Lord sought to impress him with His name and His covenant. He reminded Moses that He is Jehovah, the One who was, who is, and who will be. He also reminded him of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding the good land. He told Moses that He had lifted up His hand to give the land to <span class="pg" data-page-id="172" id="172">[172]</span> their seed. In speaking to Moses about these two matters, God was training him to know His person and His faithful word in His covenant. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTj4-ACrQmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> In addition to speaking to Moses regarding His name and His covenant, the Lord gave Moses further training concerning six other matters. The first of these matters was God’s word of assurance. We must pay attention to God’s word of assurance, the word that He speaks to us again and again. If we would follow the Lord today to carry on His testimony in His recovery, we must learn to regard God’s repeated word of assurance. But not many servants of God recognize such a word when it comes. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd86-7KzMM5Y6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> The second matter was the unbelief of the children of Israel. According to our natural concept, those to whom we are sent should be like the household of Cornelius, properly prepared and ready to receive our word. We think that if God sends us to speak to people in a certain place, their hearts will be open to receive whatever we may say. Nevertheless, due to their unbelief, the children of Israel did not hearken to Moses. Instead of being encouraged by the children of Israel, he was distracted, discouraged, and disappointed by them. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIHOaIZxO3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> There is a lesson for us here. If we are appointed by God to lead certain people, we should not expect them to be positive toward us. Suppose God establishes you as an elder in a particular church. Do not think that those in that church will be positive toward you or will believe everything you say. On the contrary, be prepared to face the unbelief of those to whom you are sent. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zGvBavySXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> Thirdly, Moses had to be trained in relation to Pharaoh’s stubbornness. Pharaoh was not easily subdued. If we had been Moses in that situation and had had to confront the stubbornness of Pharaoh, we would no doubt have been very discouraged. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgcCYvSIvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> In the fourth place, Moses had to be trained regarding his natural concept. This is seen in his cleaving to his uncircumcised lips and neglecting God’s assured word. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32378" data-verses="Exodus 6:12">6:12</span> Moses asked the Lord, “Behold, the children of Israel <span class="pg" data-page-id="173" id="173">[173]</span> have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?” This question caused the Lord to give Moses a lengthy word of assurance. But, even after that word was given, Moses still said, “Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32379" data-verses="Exodus 6:30">v. 30</span>). This indicates that Moses was cleaving to his natural faculty and neglecting God’s word of assurance. We have seen that neither the children of Israel nor Pharaoh hearkened to the Lord. Here we see that not even Moses hearkened to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjIyBqixxs7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> In His further training of Moses, God also spoke to him strongly concerning His ordination of him. Moses had been chosen by God and commissioned by Him to be His representative. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wNytm3K-vl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> Finally, God trained Moses concerning His strong hand and His great judgments (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32380" data-verses="Exodus 7:4">7:4</span>). Thus, the last item of God’s training is God’s hand, which backs His name, His covenant, and His word of assurance. It is this strong hand that defeats Pharaoh and the Egyptians and that convinces everyone, including the children of Israel, that God is Jehovah. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4bo6-JjqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> On the positive side, God’s further training of Moses covered five things: God’s name, God’s covenant, God’s word of assurance, God’s ordination, and God’s strong hand. On the negative side, this training covered three matters: the unbelief of the children of Israel, the stubbornness of Pharaoh, and Moses’ natural concept. As sent ones, we all must know these five positive things and three negative things. We need to learn that God’s chosen people are full of unbelief, that the enemy is stubborn, and that we are natural. Nevertheless, we have God’s name, God’s covenant, God’s word of assurance, God’s ordination, and God’s strong hand. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj9F4nHIG4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> After the further training given to Moses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32381" data-verses="Exodus 6:1">chapters six and seven</span>, Moses did not receive any additional training. It seems that Moses had graduated from God’s training at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32382" data-verses="Exodus 4:1">chapter four</span>. However, he did not have any experience. Due to this lack of experience, he had to undergo further training. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32383" data-verses="Exodus 7:1">chapter seven</span> Moses truly graduated <span class="pg" data-page-id="174" id="174">[174]</span> from God’s training school. In order that we all may learn from the further training given to Moses, let us now consider one by one six aspects of this training covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32384" data-verses="Exodus 6:1">6:1—7:7</span>. </p>

Hence, in this message we begin with God’s word of assurance. </p>

This was a word of assurance, which is different from a word of promise. As God was assuring Moses, it seems He was saying, “Moses, forget the people’s unbelief, forget Pharaoh, and forget the condition of your lips. But be impressed with My word of assurance. I am Jehovah, and I remember the covenant which I have established. According to My covenant, I will surely deliver the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. Moses, believe this word of assurance and care for it. I assure you My chosen people will be delivered.” </p>

The Lord did not want Moses to tell Him how bad the people were or how they refused to hearken to his word. Instead, He wanted Moses to believe and to declare that the children of Israel were the best people on earth. The Lord loved them; they were His special treasure. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l-DUgCc8l6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD">GOD’S DEMAND AND PHARAOH’S RESISTANCE <br/>(2)</h1><p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBhuz73fFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> The book of Exodus is a book of pictures, not a book of philosophy. The pictures in the first part of Exodus present a portrait of life in the world under Satan’s usurpation. By means of these pictures the nature of such a life is exposed. The pictures in this book also unveil the desire of God’s heart with respect to His chosen people. God said to Pharaoh, “Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32414" data-verses="Exodus 5:1">5:1</span>). God’s people had fallen into a worldly life under Satan’s usurpation. As the book of Exodus reveals, God delivered them from this and brought them into the wilderness and to the mountain, where they received a heavenly vision of the pattern of God’s dwelling place on earth. God wanted the tabernacle to be His dwelling place. This was the desire of His heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_BltTj54Mk5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> In order to expose the real situation of life in the world under Pharaoh’s usurpation, the book of Exodus describes twelve conflicts between Jehovah and Pharaoh. In the first conflict there were no miracles, plagues, or judgments. Instead, there was simply the negotiation between Jehovah and Pharaoh. God demanded that Pharaoh let His people go into the wilderness a three days’ journey to hold a feast unto Him. But Pharaoh refused to acknowledge Jehovah or to hearken to His demand. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GlZV6Y_5KauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> In the second conflict there was a miracle, but no plague; there was exposure, but no judgment. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32415" data-verses="Exodus 7:9">7:9</span> the Lord said, “When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.” The <span class="pg" data-page-id="186" id="186">[186]</span> purpose of this miracle was to expose the actual situation of life in the world. For this reason, the second conflict involved exposure, but not judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQa1R9s1iwajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> After the first two conflicts, the plagues began to come upon Pharaoh and his people. In Exodus there are two groups of ten items: the ten plagues that came upon the Egyptians and the Ten Commandments that were given to God’s people. The ten plagues can be grouped into four categories. The first group includes the plagues of blood, frogs, and lice; the second group, the plagues of flies, murrain, and boils; the third group, the plagues of hail, locusts, and darkness; and finally, the plague of the killing of the firstborn. Each plague was more severe than the one before. The plagues in the first group were troublesome, but they were not injurious. The plagues in the second group caused harm both to beasts and to men. The plagues in the third group destroyed the environment, and the last plague terminated the worldly life. In the last plague, all the firstborn in the land of Egypt died, from the firstborn of Pharaoh to the firstborn of the maidservants (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32416" data-verses="Exodus 11:5">11:5</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755Xw_zLqu9jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32417" data-verses="Revelation 16:1">Revelation 16</span> we see the seven ultimate plagues that God will send upon the earth, plagues that will come toward the end of the great tribulation. These seven plagues will be “the seven bowls of the fury of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32418" data-verses="Revelation 16:1">Rev. 16:1</span>). In many respects, the seven plagues in Revelation are similar to the ten plagues in Exodus. By means of the ten plagues God was able to accomplish the exodus of His chosen people from Egypt. During the great tribulation, the seven plagues will enable God’s people to make their final exodus from the world. At the end of this age, most of God’s people will still be in Egypt, that is, in the world. In their time, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had no need of an exodus. In like manner, the overcomers at the end time will have no need of an exodus. Therefore, they will be raptured before the tribulation. The majority of Christians, however, will need an exodus. By the seven last plagues, God will bring His people out of the world. <span class="pg" data-page-id="187" id="187">[187]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqH6gh-hgkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> Let us now consider the second conflict between Jehovah and Pharaoh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32419" data-verses="Exodus 7:8-14">7:8-14</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32420" data-verses="Exodus 7:10">Exodus 7:10</span> says, “And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as Jehovah had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent” (Heb.). I doubt that Pharaoh and his servants realized that the significance of this miracle was to expose the fact that their life was a life under Satan’s usurping hand, that their living in Egypt was under the Devil’s usurpation and possession. Pharaoh and his people relied on the natural resources of Egypt, especially on the rich supply of the Nile. This supply was their “rod,” a rod which was actually a serpent, the Devil. In God’s eyes Pharaoh and the Egyptians were relying on Satan and were living under Satan’s usurping hand. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2Gys4YAr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> This exposure was not a punishment, but an expression of God’s mercy. In His mercy God exposed the true nature of Egyptian living. He wanted the Egyptians to know that everything they relied on was of the Devil. God’s intention in this exposure was to cause them to forsake that kind of living. The principle is the same today. When God comes to us, He does not firstly punish the self, the flesh, or the old man. In His mercy He firstly exposes the satanic nature of our fallen life. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7TmIOYWYe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-">B. On Pharaoh’s Side</h2><p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9InpZlJRHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> Pharaoh called upon the magicians to do the same thing with their rods as Aaron had done with his (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32421" data-verses="Exodus 7:11">7:11</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32422" data-verses="Exodus 7:12">Verse 12</span> says, “For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.” Years ago, I wondered why the Egyptian magicians were able to do the same thing Aaron had done. I asked the Lord concerning this and told Him that I did not see how such a thing could happen. We may encounter a similar situation in the preaching of the gospel. We may compare <span class="pg" data-page-id="188" id="188">[188]</span> the philosophers of the world today to those magicians. These philosophers may teach things similar to what we preach in the gospel. We may expose the nature of the fallen human life, and they may do the same. We may speak about the preoccupations of life in the world, and they may do this also. Nevertheless, just as Aaron’s rod swallowed up the rods of the Egyptian magicians, so the preaching of the gospel swallows up today’s philosophical teachings. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGs9ZBwYfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> We experienced this many times in our gospel preaching in China, where there were many “magicians,” or philosophical teachers. Certain teachings of these philosophers were nearly the same as some of the teachings in the Bible. For example, the Bible teaches that we should not love the world. Some Chinese philosophers taught the same thing. However, in our preaching of the gospel Aaron’s rod swallowed up the rods of the “magicians.” Philosophers from colleges and universities sometimes attended our gospel meetings. Instead of being threatened by their presence, we called on the Lord and asked Him to deal with these people. He showed forth His wisdom, and we saw the gospel swallow up the teaching of the philosophers. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPQ83kquJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> The gospel swallows up all the philosophies of the world. Do not be threatened or discouraged in your preaching of the gospel. Rather, believe that your rod will swallow up the philosophical rods. Nothing can overcome the gospel. Although the gospel is not philosophy, nothing is more philosophical than the gospel. For this reason the gospel is able to swallow up the rods of the world’s philosophers. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnC4heRr8fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ">C. The Issue</h2><p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJF_S00MaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32423" data-verses="Exodus 7:13-14">verses 13 and 14</span> we see the issue of the second conflict. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32424" data-verses="Exodus 7:13">Verse 13</span> says, “And Pharaoh’s heart was hard, that he hearkened not unto them” (Heb.). Most versions of the Bible say that Pharaoh’s heart was hardened. This, however, is not the meaning here. Such a rendering implies that Pharaoh’s heart may have been soft but that it became hard. But Pharaoh’s heart was hard from the very beginning. Darby says that the Hebrew word for hard in this verse means <span class="pg" data-page-id="189" id="189">[189]</span> stubborn. Because Pharaoh’s heart was stubborn, it could not be changed. The second conflict exposed the hardness of Pharaoh’s heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-DwtwcMx5qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> A further issue of this conflict was Pharaoh’s refusal to let the children of Israel go (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32425" data-verses="Exodus 7:14">v. 14</span>). The first time God came in, Pharaoh refused to hearken to His word. This time Pharaoh refused to hearken to God’s demand, even after God had exposed the nature of life in the world under Satan. This forced God to deal with Pharaoh more severely in the third conflict. </p>

After the exodus from Egypt, God’s people saw a heavenly vision by which they came to know God Himself and, in addition, to know the kind of living that is in accordance with God. Then they could be built up as God’s dwelling place on earth. This is the basic concept of the book of Exodus. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGs9JB0LvVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> God longs to rescue His chosen people from every form of usurpation and preoccupation so that they may have nothing besides God Himself. After the children of Israel had been delivered from Egypt and had passed through the Red Sea, they came to Mount Horeb, the mountain of God. At one time, God’s people were in Egypt, living an Egyptian life and performing Egyptian labor under the tyranny of Pharaoh. Although many of them may have had no thought of God, they were nevertheless God’s chosen people, for they had been predestinated by God to be separated unto Him. The first chapters of Exodus reveal that God’s people had been usurped by Satan and were held in bondage under Satan’s hand. At that time, everything related to them was Egyptian. There was nothing about them that was for God. Therefore, God came in to deliver them, to separate them, to release them from Satan’s usurpation and Egypt’s preoccupation, and to bring them to the mountain of God, where there was nothing at all Egyptian. There at the mountain of God the people God had chosen could be alone with Him. When the children of Israel came to Mount Horeb, God was <span class="pg" data-page-id="194" id="194">[194]</span> their center, their purpose, their business, and their very life. He was even their home. God was everything to them. In the wilderness, especially at the mountain of God, Mount Horeb, the children of Israel had nothing but God. Many Christians today talk about being saved. But very few realize that to be saved is to be brought to a place where there is nothing but God. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPQ8nkt9JfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> More than any other book in the Bible, the book of Exodus exposes the world. Although the New Testament speaks a great deal about the world, even telling us that the whole world lies in the evil one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32437" data-verses="1John 5:19">1 John 5:19</span>), it does not present a clear picture of what the world is. For this, we must come to the book of Exodus, which is a book of pictures. If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32438" data-verses="Exodus 5:1">chapters five through twelve</span> in a proper way, we shall see a series of vivid pictures portraying the nature and meaning of the life of the world. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnC4hORtvPiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> God wants His people to see the world for what it is. If the element of the world remains in us, we shall be damaged in relation to the fulfilling of God’s purpose. When the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they remembered the enjoyment they had in Egypt. They recalled the taste of the leeks, the onions, and the garlic (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32439" data-verses="Numbers 11:5">Num. 11:5</span>). Due to this remembrance they had a problem with God’s dwelling place. The same is true of Christians today. Because many Christians are still in Egypt, they can have nothing to do with God’s dwelling place. Even those who have been separated from Egypt may still remember the pleasure of Egypt. Hence, we all need to see a clear picture of the life and living in Egypt. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJF_C09c6oTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> Not only were the ten plagues a warning and a punishment to the Egyptians, but they were also a revelation, an unveiling, to God’s people. By means of these plagues, the children of Israel must have come to see the actual situation of Egyptian living. As a result of these plagues, they must have come to loathe their living in Egypt. God wanted the life in Egypt to be exposed so that His people would hate it and want to flee from it. Therefore, God’s purpose in sending the ten plagues was not only to warn the Egyptians and to <span class="pg" data-page-id="195" id="195">[195]</span> punish them. It was also to show His own people what the world was. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-DwtwMM5paQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> The world also needs to be unveiled to God’s people today. God wants His people to be His dwelling place on earth. However, this desire can be fulfilled only if we have been delivered from the world and have nothing besides God Himself. In these days we have been emphasizing the need for the building up of the churches. But if we want to see the churches built up in a practical way, we must come fully out of the world. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4ftZI07UCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> On the negative side, the book of Exodus unveils the world. On the positive side, it reveals God’s dwelling place. Firstly, the true nature, meaning, and issue of life in Egypt are exposed to God’s people. God’s intention in giving this revelation is to cause His people to become disgusted with Egypt, to leave Egypt behind, and to be separated to God for His dwelling place. The principle is the same today. If we have not been separated from the world, we cannot become God’s dwelling place. For the building up of His dwelling place, we must see the world as it really is. Furthermore, we must loathe the world’s way of living and be willing to forsake it. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP_35f6BP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> If we see God’s purpose as it is disclosed in the book of Exodus, it will be easier for us to understand the significance of the plagues. God’s intention in sending the plagues was not only to punish the Egyptians; it was also to expose the Egyptian living. Like the Egyptians in the book of Exodus, the people in the world today have no understanding of the actual situation of life in the world. The worldly people have all been drugged. Under the influence of Satan’s drugging, they are happy with their life in the world. They have no realization of what it is to live without God in the world. In their experience, the water of the world needs to be turned into blood. Then they will know the nature of life in the world and the result of living in the world. The nature of life in the world is death, and the result of living in the world is also death. <span class="pg" data-page-id="196" id="196">[196]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9uA-vN2w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> In the fourth conflict with Pharaoh, the Lord smote all the borders of Egypt with frogs (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32440" data-verses="Exodus 8:2">8:2</span>). Frogs came up from the waters of the rivers, the streams, and the ponds. By coming upon Pharaoh, all his servants, and all the Egyptians, the frogs destroyed the enjoyment of the comfortable Egyptian living. How troublesome these frogs were! By sending the plague of the frogs upon the Egyptians, the Lord wanted the Egyptians to realize that their life in Egypt was not really a life of enjoyment, but a life of trouble. The Egyptians did not realize that, in the eyes of God, all their enjoyments were “frogs.” Everything they gathered from the Nile, the source of the world’s supply, was a frog. The waters in Egypt that once produced fish now brought forth frogs. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC4wXI-H6C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> In principle, we may experience the same thing today. Throughout the course of my life, I have gathered many things that turned out to be “frogs.” At first, I enjoyed these things. But one by one, they became “frogs.” What I thought was a “fish” was actually a “frog.” Sooner or later, everything you gain in this world will become a “frog.” This means that everything you gather up from the “Nile,” the source of supply for the world, will be a cause of trouble to you. Material possessions and even people dear to you can be “frogs.” When the things we treasure turn into “frogs,” then we realize that the enjoyment of the world is not the true enjoyment. On the contrary, it is very troublesome. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTbIAABDWVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> The frogs in Egypt did not kill anyone, but they were a nuisance to everyone. They were everywhere—in their houses, in their bedrooms, upon their beds, in their ovens, and in their kneading troughs. What a nuisance! </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8FKe1K2xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> Whether the plague of the frogs was a form of punishment or a revelation depended upon the attitude of the people who were subject to the plague. If they had received the Lord’s mercy, it would have been a revelation to them, an exposure of the fact that Egypt with its enjoyment is a land of frogs. This is the meaning of the living of the world. Every <span class="pg" data-page-id="197" id="197">[197]</span> aspect of the world’s enjoyment is a “frog.” Those who refused the Lord’s mercy, however, had to endure the plague of the frogs as a punishment. </p>

But God’s enemy has usurped His people and holds them in bondage in the world. Therefore, in the first fourteen chapters of Exodus, there was a struggle between God and Pharaoh, the representative of Satan. In this struggle God’s judgment upon the Egyptian world was made manifest through the ten plagues. However, the plagues were not only a punishment, but also God’s way of exposing the nature, the meaning, and the issue of the life of the world, the life which occupied the people of God. Hence, the plagues that came upon the Egyptians were not only punishments, but also merciful warnings. If the Egyptians had received mercy, they would have seen the nature, meaning, and result of the life in the world. </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRA-IKgixmTX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> It is quite meaningful that God sent ten plagues, not nine or eleven. In the Bible the number ten signifies perfection or completeness in human living. For example, our ten fingers and ten toes signify such completeness. The Bible reveals that at the end of this age there will be ten kingdoms under the rule of Antichrist. Those ten kingdoms will be the ultimate expression of fallen human life. In order to expose human life in the world, God used ten plagues. As we have pointed out, these ten plagues are divided into four groups. The first three groups consist of three plagues each, with the last plague standing in a category of its own. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTN0iRVWPtP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> We have covered the first group of plagues, the plagues of blood, frogs, and lice. The plagues of blood and frogs are <span class="pg" data-page-id="202" id="202">[202]</span> related to water, whereas the plague of lice is related to the dust of the earth. Hence, in the first group of plagues the water and the earth were exposed and judged. We are all dependent on the water and the earth for our livelihood. The supply necessary to sustain human life comes from these two sources. In the first three plagues God exposed the nature of the fallen life of mankind. As He did so, He showed that the resources of man’s livelihood issue in death, trouble, and irritation. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5YRplIP0fCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> The second group of three plagues deals mainly with the air. Today there is much concern about air pollution. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth plagues, the air in Egypt became polluted. Flies swarmed in the air, pestilence was carried through the air, and ashes that caused boils were sprinkled into the air. Therefore, in the second group of plagues, the air, another necessity for man’s life, was dealt with. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FbVFnmbjPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> I wish to emphasize the fact that these plagues were not only a form of punishment, but also an exposure of the world and of the life in the world. If God’s intention had been to use the plagues only as punishment, there would have been no need for Him to send Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh again and again. Furthermore, there would have been no need for Him to send the plagues over a period of so many days. Instead, God could have punished the Egyptians and destroyed them with one blow. However, God dealt with them in a fine, detailed way. Firstly, God changed the water into blood. Then He brought forth the troublesome frogs and, following that, the irritating lice. God’s purpose in doing so was not only to punish the Egyptians, but to teach both them and His own people that the resources of man’s life supply have actually become blood, frogs, and lice. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr86_7R7ew6MJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> God created the heavens for the earth and the earth for man’s living. Thus, both the heavens and the earth are for man’s existence. Man, however, has fallen. According to His righteousness, God should have judged both the heavens and the earth immediately after the fall of Adam. But God’s intention is to accomplish His eternal purpose through man. <span class="pg" data-page-id="203" id="203">[203]</span> Instead of judging everything, God put the universe under the redemption of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJF8y00OaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> The redemption of Christ is a very weighty matter, much more significant than we realize. God established Adam as the head of the whole creation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32446" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>. In principle, when the head rebelled, all creation came under the curse and should have been judged immediately according to God’s righteousness. The whole creation should have collapsed. God cannot tolerate anything that touches His righteousness, holiness, and glory; but neither will He change His heart concerning His purpose to have an eternal dwelling among man. Therefore, God chose to view the whole creation under the redemption of Christ, which in His eyes had been accomplished before the foundation of the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32447" data-verses="1Peter 1:19-20">1 Pet. 1:19-20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32448" data-verses="Revelation 13:8">Rev. 13:8</span>). Because God views the old creation under the redemption of Christ, He has the freedom either to preserve the universe or to judge it and destroy it. Because of the redemption of Christ, God is wholly just and righteous whether He keeps the universe or destroys it. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-Dwtz8Mx7qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> When God could no longer tolerate the sinfulness of Sodom and Gomorrah because they rebelled against Him and rejected the redemption He had ordained, that part of the earth came under His righteous judgment. In principle, the same thing happened in Moses’ time. Pharaoh and the Egyptians rejected the redemption ordained by God and thus made themselves naked and exposed to God’s judgment. Because the children of Israel were still under the redemption, God’s judgment did not touch them. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32449" data-verses="Exodus 8:23">Exodus 8:23</span> is a crucial verse: “I will put a redemption between my people and thy people” (Heb.). Here the Lord was telling Pharaoh that He would put a redemption between His people and Pharaoh’s people. God covered His people with the redemption of Christ, but Pharaoh and his people rejected God’s redemption. Therefore, when God sent the plagues upon the Egyptians, they were not under God’s redemption, but were exposed to His judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNFZ9oHDbKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> In the fall, man had sinned against God’s righteousness and had come short of God’s glory. Nevertheless, God did not <span class="pg" data-page-id="204" id="204">[204]</span> come in with judgment. How then could God’s righteousness be maintained? According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32450" data-verses="Genesis 3:21">Genesis 3:21</span>, the answer rests in God’s redemption. The skins of the animal God used to cover Adam and Eve point to the redemption of Christ. Because of the redemption of Christ, God is able righteously to maintain the existence of the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf4p8LoqRmndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> In Exodus Pharaoh and the Egyptians did not care for the redemption of Christ. They deserved to be judged for the way they were treating God’s people. Therefore, God exercised His judgment upon the Egyptians through the ten plagues. At the time of the plagues, the Egyptians were exposed to God’s righteous dealings. The children of Israel, however, remained under the redemption of Christ, for God had put a redemption between them and Pharaoh’s people. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoaTPbWzqNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> Today the whole earth is still under the redemption of Christ. If it were not for Christ’s redemption, the sun, the moon, and the planets would disintegrate. God upholds the heavens and the earth for the sake of man’s existence. You may wonder how the righteous God can tolerate the sinfulness of people in the world today. He can tolerate it only because He views the world through the redemption of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVMh3NEKXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> All the people of the world are actually enjoying the benefit of Christ’s redemption, although they have no realization of it. Colossians tells us that God has reconciled all things to Himself through the death of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32451" data-verses="Colossians 1:20">1:20</span>). Only under the redemption of Christ is this earth a suitable place for man to live. If the creation were not under the redemption of Christ, it would collapse. But God extends His mercy to view the unbelievers under the redemption of Christ that they might have the opportunity to repent and receive this redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJtwfO--Uiqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> All the food we eat and all the life supply we enjoy are under the redemption of Christ. Otherwise, the water would become blood, the fish would become frogs, the earth would produce either thorns or lice instead of grain, and from the air would come flies. The ten plagues came upon Egypt because they rejected God’s redemption. <span class="pg" data-page-id="205" id="205">[205]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRA-IKgmi2TX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> At the time of Pharaoh’s resistance to God, Pharaoh and the Egyptians exposed themselves to God’s righteous judgment. But He was merciful even in the exercise of His judgment. Instead of annihilating the Egyptians with one act of judgment, He sent a series of plagues upon them. His intention in doing this was not only to punish or to judge, but also to expose and to warn the Egyptians that they might have opportunity to turn to Him. </p>

Like the first two groups, this group also is composed of three plagues. We have seen that God used the first six plagues to expose the actual condition of the water, the earth, and the air, all of which are necessary for man’s livelihood. As we shall now see, in the third group of plagues God altered some of the principles that govern the functions of the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0IxR25ZoJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32464" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span> God restored the universe which had been judged because of Satan’s rebellion. As a result of God’s judgment, darkness was upon the surface of the deep (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32465" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">Gen. 1:2</span>). Everything had become void and desolate. In His work of restoration and further creation, God caused the light to appear, and then He gathered the waters together so that the dry land could come forth. On this land various kinds of life—grass, herbs, and trees—came into being. Then God created the sun, the moon, and the stars, which are necessary for the development of higher life on earth. Through this procedure, God prepared everything necessary for man’s living on earth. Therefore, the Bible reveals that the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man with his human spirit is for God. </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneHLPN7MHHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> Because the heavens are for the earth, they provide sunshine, wind, and rain to sustain life on earth. Without these three things, nothing can grow. Man must have such a provision if he is to live on earth for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. <span class="pg" data-page-id="214" id="214">[214]</span> </p>

THE NINTH CONFLICT</h2><p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zGsBamgyXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32466" data-verses="Genesis 2:5">Genesis 2:5</span> indicates that in order for things to grow, there is the need of two things: rain to water the earth and a man to till the ground. Rain is a basic factor in the growth of living things on earth. Rain is primarily for life, to enable living things to grow. The function of rain is both to cause plants and trees to grow and to quench the thirst of man. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgcBYvaafwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> During the ninth conflict between the Lord and Pharaoh, the Lord changed the function of the rain (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32467" data-verses="Exodus 9:13-35">9:13-35</span>). Instead of water, there was hail that damaged the produce of the earth. In this plague God changed one of the functions of the universe; that is, He changed one of the natural principles governing the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m5HIoCMoyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> The universe was not only created by God, but also arranged and ordained by Him to meet the need of man. Therefore, God has ordained certain principles or laws to govern the function of the universe. In the seventh plague God changed the principle related to the functions of rain. The rain no longer watered the earth for the production of life, but became hail to damage the life on earth. Instead of quenching people’s thirst, it killed them. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32468" data-verses="Exodus 9:23">Exodus 9:23</span> says that as the hail was coming down, fire ran along above the ground. Furthermore, the fire was even mingled with the hail (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32469" data-verses="Exodus 9:24">v. 24</span>). Hence, two extremes were mingled together as an indication that God had changed the function of the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh90fqmOovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> It is possible to apply this plague to our own spiritual experience. If our relationship with God is proper, He sends the spiritual rain upon us to water the garden in our spirit and to quench our thirst. But if we are stubborn or rebellious against the Lord, our relationship with Him is destroyed, and He alters the spiritual function of the rain by sending hail upon our spirit and fire with the hail. This change of spiritual function causes severe damage. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-2L_0Ye189qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS">X. THE TENTH CONFLICT</h2><p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB5KLCfIi6RI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> In the eighth plague, which took place during the tenth conflict (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32470" data-verses="Exodus 10:1-20">10:1-20</span>), we see a change in another function of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="215" id="215">[215]</span> universe. This time God changed the function of the wind. When the wind functions normally, it sends a supply of fresh air. If there were no wind at all, we all would suffocate. We thank the Lord for the function of wind to sustain our life on earth. Spiritually speaking, the Lord is also the wind to us. The line of a hymn says, “I cannot breathe enough of Thee, O gentle breeze of love” (<em>Hymns,</em> #172). For a proper spiritual life, we need to experience Christ as a gentle breeze. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZUwz8-FcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> In the eighth plague God altered the function of the wind so that it no longer supplied fresh air to support life, but caused locusts to appear which devoured what remained from the plague of the hail. The hail destroyed herbs and trees in a rough way, but the locusts did a finer work to devour the plant life. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32471" data-verses="Exodus 10:15">10:15</span> says, the locusts “covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.” What a thorough work was done by the locusts! In judging the Egyptians and in educating both them and the children of Israel, God did a fine, detailed work. After the hail, the locusts came to consume the life supply. This was caused by a change in one of the functions of the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-YMgcLxIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> After the first eight plagues, it seems that there was no need for further judgment or education. Look how much damage had been done to the land of Egypt. The water had become blood, the dust had become lice, the water had brought forth frogs, flies had polluted the air, pestilence had destroyed the cattle, boils had broken forth upon man and beast, the rain had been changed into hail, and the wind had brought in locusts. What thorough destruction! If I had been there, I would have told the Lord that these plagues were sufficient, for everything had been destroyed. </p>

THE ELEVENTH CONFLICT</h2><p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTj7-AE4AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> God, however, was not finished. In the ninth plague He went on to change the function of the sun (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32472" data-verses="Exodus 10:21-29">10:21-29</span>). In the <span class="pg" data-page-id="216" id="216">[216]</span> eleventh conflict between the Lord and Pharaoh, “there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32473" data-verses="Exodus 10:22">10:22</span>). This darkness was so thick that it could be felt. It was not a vague, abstract darkness, but a solid, substantial darkness. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32474" data-verses="Exodus 10:23">Exodus 10:23</span> says of the Egyptians, “They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days.” Because of this thick darkness, all movement in Egypt ceased. For a period of three days, everything was terminated. Here we see God’s wisdom. In order to deal with the Egyptians, He did not use weapons that men regard as powerful. Instead, He used things such as frogs, lice, and flies. Exercising His control over the universe to change the principles and the natural laws, He sent upon the Egyptians a darkness so thick that it was impossible for anyone to move. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd86-4KzFcZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> The third group of plagues was even more meaningful than the first two groups because in these plagues God dealt with the rain, the wind, and the sunshine. This made it impossible for the Egyptians to live. No wonder that Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32475" data-verses="Exodus 10:7">10:7</span>, Heb.). Nevertheless, Pharaoh remained stubborn. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIHNaIRh-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> Pharaoh possessed an unusual ability to stand against God. He could endure all manner of suffering without being subdued. If I had been Pharaoh, I would have given in to the Lord’s demand at the time of the first plague. As soon as I saw the water turn into blood, I would have told the children of Israel to get out of my territory. But although the land of Egypt was smitten with plague after plague, Pharaoh remained stubborn, even when the functions of the universe related to Egypt were changed. </p>

<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP82Jf8T_8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> God’s demand of Pharaoh is stated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32486" data-verses="Exodus 5:1">5:1</span>. According to this verse, the Lord spoke to Pharaoh through Moses and Aaron, “Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.” Furthermore, the Lord required His people to take a three days’ journey into the wilderness and to sacrifice unto Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32487" data-verses="Exodus 5:3">5:3</span>). Not only does this journey of three days signify a long distance; it also signifies burial and resurrection. In the Bible the third day signifies resurrection. The Lord Jesus was resurrected on the third day, and, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32488" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, the dry land, a type of Christ in resurrection, appeared on the third day. Therefore, the three days’ journey here signifies burial and resurrection. The natural man had to be buried so that God’s people could be raised up from death into resurrection. The crossing of the Red Sea signified the process of burial and resurrection. In the eyes of both God and Satan, the children of Israel passed through the burial of the Red Sea and entered into resurrection. As God’s called and chosen people, we also must pass through such a process of burial and resurrection. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="222" id="222">[222]</span> means that we must travel a three days’ journey in order to be buried and resurrected. By means of such a journey, God’s people not only come out of Egypt, but they also enter, in resurrection, into a new environment. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2jijkvOlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> Negatively the wilderness signifies a place of wandering, but positively it signifies a realm of separation. When the children of Israel entered into the wilderness, they were separated from everything Egyptian, from everything worldly. This separation is related to burial and resurrection. Once we were in Egypt, that is, in the world. But through burial and resurrection we have passed out of the world into the wilderness, where we are separated to the Lord. In His dealing with Pharaoh, God demanded such a separation for His people. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3h3iJ1lUyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA">B. That His People May Hold a Feast to Him<br/>and Sacrifice to Him</h2><p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTN3gRVRdNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> Separation, however, is not the goal. God’s goal was that the children of Israel would hold a feast to Him. He wanted them to be happy with Him in His presence. To hold a feast unto God is to enjoy God with God. Everyone who has truly been saved has experienced times of overflowing with joy in the Lord’s presence. Such times are real holidays. If you have not enjoyed such a feast with the Lord but have only been happy when participating in worldly amusements, then perhaps you have not yet been saved. Being saved does not depend upon having such an enjoyment. Nevertheless, everyone who is saved will have the experience, at least once in his Christian life, of holding a feast to the Lord, of enjoying the Lord in His presence. Sometimes I have been so beside myself with joy in the Lord that it seemed as if I were dancing before Him. This is not doctrine or theory but a marvelous enjoyment of our salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5bTplOdEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> Furthermore, the children of Israel were to sacrifice unto the Lord. According to our experience, when we hold a feast unto the Lord, enjoying Him in His presence, our heart is deeply touched by the Lord Jesus. He becomes so dear and precious to us, and we have a fresh love for Him. We simply <span class="pg" data-page-id="223" id="223">[223]</span> have no words to utter how sweet He is to us. He touches the depths of our being, and we respond by thanking the Father for His dear Son. This is to offer sacrifice unto God, to present the precious Christ to God as a sacrifice. As we offer Christ to the Father, the Father is pleased, happy, and satisfied by us through our sacrifice of Christ. Therefore, God’s demand of Pharaoh was to let His people go a three days’ journey into the wilderness so that they could hold a feast to Him and sacrifice unto Him. This is the enjoyment of God’s salvation. </p>

<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjhacNXOmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> At first Pharaoh rejected God’s demand and said, “Who is Jehovah, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, neither will I let Israel go” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32489" data-verses="Exodus 5:2">5:2</span>, Heb.). Satan is subtle. The self and natural man, whether of ourselves or of others, are also subtle. Moreover, our natural mind, will, and emotion are subtle. In fact, anything natural is subtle. By this we see that Pharaoh is to be found everywhere. Pharaoh denies God and ignores His demand to let the children of Israel go. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD4rTasYW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> I do not believe that Pharaoh actually did not know that there was such a God as Jehovah. On the contrary, Pharaoh must have known of Jehovah’s existence, but he purposely denied Him. He insolently asked why he had to listen to God’s word. The natural man does the same thing today. For example, a brother’s wife may know that there is a God, but she may reject His demand. The brother may tell his wife that he has received a call from the Lord. The wife may react and say, “Who is God? Why should I heed His call to you?” At such a time, she is a Pharaoh rejecting God and His demand. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzINIMjQ8CdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> Actually, it was Satan in Pharaoh who denied God. Satan knew very well that there was a God, for at one time he was in God’s presence. Nevertheless, Satan worked in Pharaoh to deny God and to refuse to listen to Him. This was the first stage of Pharaoh’s subtle bargaining. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqb_h6EdD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> Many saved ones bargained with the Lord in this way <span class="pg" data-page-id="224" id="224">[224]</span> when they first heard the gospel. Deep within, they said, “Who is God? Why must I listen to Him? Why doesn’t He listen to me? Why do I need Him? He is the one who needs me. As far as I’m concerned, the heavens and the earth should be mine.” Many have reasoned with God in this way. </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36SB1LLPBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> God’s response to this subtle bargaining is to send a plague. I have seen this many times. For example, an intelligent medical student may reason with God when he hears the word of the gospel. He may argue with God and tell Him that he has no intention of listening to Him. Instead of arguing in return, God sends some type of plague, perhaps an illness that no physician can diagnose, in order to bring this young man to repentance and to faith in Christ. In sending such a plague, God exercises His finger. The Egyptian magicians recognized that one of the plagues was brought about by the finger of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32490" data-verses="Exodus 8:19">8:19</span>). Pharaoh reasoned with God until the plagues began to come. However, as soon as each plague was over, Pharaoh began once again to reason with the Lord. Therefore, God sent one plague after another. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0LzB29JYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> Very few receive the gospel without hesitation or consideration. In order to deal with this kind of bargaining, God sends plagues again and again. </p>

Here Pharaoh was telling them that they could sacrifice to their God provided that they stay in the land of Egypt. There was no need for them to make a journey into the wilderness. Pharaoh admitted that there was a God and that His people were required to serve Him and sacrifice to Him. But he was not willing for them to leave his country. They could sacrifice to God, provided that they remained in Egypt. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zFuRasyyXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> To this subtle proposal Moses replied, “It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of <span class="pg" data-page-id="225" id="225">[225]</span> the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32492" data-verses="Exodus 8:26">8:26</span>
). Moses knew that what God’s people would sacrifice to the Lord would be an abomination to the Egyptians. What God accepted, the Egyptians would reject. Therefore, they could not sacrifice to God in Egypt. </p>

The argument concerning this is related to whether God hardened Pharaoh’s heart or Pharaoh hardened his own heart. Regarding the hardening of Pharaoh’s heart, Moses uses various expressions. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32506" data-verses="Exodus 4:21">4:21</span> God says, “I will harden his heart.” However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32507" data-verses="Exodus 8:15">8:15</span> Moses says that Pharaoh “hardened his heart.” Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32508" data-verses="Exodus 9:7">9:7</span> we are told that “the heart of Pharaoh was hardened,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32509" data-verses="Exodus 9:35">9:35</span> that “the heart of Pharaoh was hard.” On the one hand, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32510" data-verses="Exodus 10:1">10:1</span> says that the Lord “hardened his heart,” but, on the other hand, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32511" data-verses="Exodus 10:20">10:20</span> we see that the Lord “made Pharaoh’s heart hard” (Heb.). According to the meaning of the Hebrew words used, Pharaoh’s heart became not only hard, but also stubborn and obstinate. The fact that Moses uses different words to describe the hardening of Pharaoh’s heart indicates the seriousness of this matter. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh-2fqicYvIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3">I.

Some of those who do not believe the Bible argue that God was wrong in hardening Pharaoh’s heart. At the time Paul wrote the book of Romans, such arguments had already begun. Therefore, Paul appealed to God’s sovereignty and asked, “But, O man, who are you that replies against God? Shall the thing formed say to him who formed it, Why did you make me thus?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32512" data-verses="Romans 9:20">Rom. 9:20</span>). In the next verse Paul goes on to say, “Has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor?” Here Paul says that as the Creator, God has the <span class="pg" data-page-id="232" id="232">[232]</span> sovereign authority to do whatever He likes. Who are we to argue with Him? We need to recognize that we are clay and that God is the potter. He has the authority out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor. He has the right to make vessels of wrath (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32513" data-verses="Romans 9:22">v. 22</span>
) as well as vessels of mercy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32514" data-verses="Romans 9:23">v. 23</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB5JJCfOwqRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> Do you consider yourself a vessel of wrath or a vessel of mercy? On the one hand, the kind of vessel we are is absolutely a matter of God’s sovereignty. But, on the other hand, it depends on what we say of ourselves. Like so many other things in the universe, there are two sides here, God’s side and man’s side. If we say that we are vessels of wrath, that is what we are. But if we say that we are vessels of mercy and of honor unto glory, then we are such vessels. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZXyz83W8JlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32515" data-verses="Romans 9:16">Romans 9:16</span> Paul says, “So then, it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy.” To be a vessel of mercy and of honor unto glory does not depend on our willing or our running, but on God’s mercy to us. It is of God’s sovereign mercy that we are vessels of mercy. We were not the ones who decided to become vessels of mercy. God made this decision before we were born. Only because of God’s sovereignty are we able to say that we are vessels of mercy. In ourselves and of ourselves we have no right to say this. As the One with authority over the clay, the Potter has chosen to make us vessels of mercy. However, our confession that we are vessels of mercy is a proof that God has made us so. </p>

<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIEPaIRj-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> God’s mercy is according to His will. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32516" data-verses="Romans 9:18">Romans 9:18</span> Paul concludes, “He has mercy on whom He wills, and He hardens whom He wills.” We cannot explain why God has willed to show mercy to us. The only thing we can say is that, according to God’s will, the mercy of God has been extended to us. Regarding this, the Bible is emphatic. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32517" data-verses="Romans 9:18">Romans 9:18</span>, God may will either to show mercy or to harden. This is illustrated by the cases of Moses and Pharaoh. Moses was <span class="pg" data-page-id="233" id="233">[233]</span> one to whom God willed to show His mercy, whereas Pharaoh was one whom God willed to harden. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32518" data-verses="Romans 9:15">Romans 9:15</span> Paul quotes God’s word to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.” This indicates that the mercy shown to us is altogether according to God’s own will. </p>

In His Sovereignty</h2><p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0SSyMJujsWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> Furthermore, God’s mercy is in His sovereignty (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32519" data-verses="Romans 9:20-23">Rom. 9:20-23</span>). The only thing we can say to explain God’s mercy to us is that in His sovereignty He has chosen to be merciful to us. Consider the case of Esau and Jacob. Who can say why God willed to choose Jacob and not Esau? All we can say is that in His sovereignty God chose the one and not the other. God’s selection is absolutely according to His sovereignty. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYPATIJBazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> As those favored by God, we should not only thank Him for His mercy, but also worship Him for His sovereignty. There are hymns on God’s mercy, but it is very difficult to find a hymn on God’s sovereignty. When it comes to writing hymns on God’s sovereignty, we have little to say. Along with Paul, we need to be brought to God’s sovereignty. Instead of reasoning with Him, we should say, “O Father God, I worship You for Your sovereignty. Although I am not worthy, in Your sovereignty You have willed to show me Your mercy.” Never presume to touch the sovereignty of God. Heed Paul’s warning when he asks, “Who are you that replies against God?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32520" data-verses="Romans 9:20">Rom. 9:20</span>). If we realize that we are nothing more than clay, we shall not argue with God. Rather, we shall simply worship Him for His sovereignty. </p>

MAN’S FREE WILL</h2><p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBivD7yMFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> In the universe there are three things that cannot be denied: God’s sovereignty, God’s mercy, and man’s free will. God’s sovereignty and mercy are both divine and eternal, without beginning or ending. Man’s free will, on the contrary, is something created by God. In creating man with a free will, God displayed His greatness. Because He is great, <span class="pg" data-page-id="234" id="234">[234]</span> He does not force us to choose Him. Rather, He leaves us free to make our own choice. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Bmsjj9rck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> The fact that God granted man a free choice also reveals His wisdom and love. No one who is great, wise, and loving compels others to do things. Instead, such a person will always respect the free will of others and say, “The choice is yours. If you want to do this, you may choose to do so. You must make the decision.” Whether we take God or reject Him is a matter of our choice. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32521" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> proves that man has a free will. According to this chapter, God placed the man created by Him in front of two trees, the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and man was free to choose between them. When I was young, I thought God was mistaken in allowing the second tree to be in the garden. It seemed to me that if there had been only one tree, the tree of life, there could have been no problem. But in His greatness, wisdom, and love, God gave man the opportunity to choose Him by placing him in front of two trees. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GmYl6fvZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32522" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>, Eve deliberately chose to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge. In making this decision, she exercised her discernment and free will. In the same principle, we must decide whether or not to believe in the Lord Jesus. Furthermore, after receiving Him, we must choose whether or not we shall seek Him. Some may think that the situation in the universe would be wonderful if Satan did not exist. Nevertheless, it is a fact that both God and Satan, both life and death, are present and we must choose between them. </p>

Recently, as I was considering this, I was surprised that the almighty God, the Creator, could be so patient with Pharaoh. Time after time God had sent a plague upon the Egyptians, but Pharaoh still continued to resist His demand. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_BmsTj14Mk5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32530" data-verses="Exodus 9:16">Exodus 9:16</span> says, “But for this cause have I made thee stand, in order to show thee my power; and in order to declare my name throughout all the earth” (Heb.). This verse, God’s word to Pharaoh, indicates that it was God who made Pharaoh to stand. Now we can understand why Pharaoh was so strong to reject God’s demand. Here we see two aspects of God’s sovereignty. On the one hand, God hardened Pharaoh’s heart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32531" data-verses="Exodus 11:10">11:10</span>). On the other hand, God made him to stand. Because God had hardened Pharaoh’s heart, Pharaoh would not submit to the Lord’s dealings. Furthermore, realizing that Pharaoh, in himself, was not strong enough to stand against Him, God made him to stand. Otherwise, God would have lost the opportunity to make His power known and to declare His name throughout the earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36SBVLLNBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> I believe that in history Pharaoh is unique in refusing to submit to God’s demands.

<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0Lzh29LYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32532" data-verses="Romans 9:1">Romans 9</span> Paul was involved in an argument related to God’s selection. In the course of this argument, he appealed to God’s sovereignty. Using Pharaoh as an example, Paul pointed out that the Lord “has mercy on whom He wills, and He hardens whom He wills” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32533" data-verses="Romans 9:18">v. 18</span>). It is all according to God’s sovereign will. Paul also quoted the Lord’s word to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32534" data-verses="Romans 9:15">v. 15</span>). Here Paul spoke very boldly. According to His sovereign will, God willed to have mercy on Moses, and He willed to harden Pharaoh. </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneHIN97LVHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> Twelve times Moses, an elderly man, came to negotiate with Pharaoh on the Lord’s behalf. Pharaoh, the troubled one, could do nothing with Moses, the troubling one, because Moses was backed by the sovereign Lord. The One in the heavens was standing with Moses. Moses, therefore, is an example of one who had received mercy from God, whereas Pharaoh is an example of one who was wholly set aside by God. Although God set Pharaoh aside, He still used him. Not only was Moses useful to the Lord, but Pharaoh was useful also. Can you believe that Pharaoh also was useful to the Lord? In your heart you probably believe that only Moses was useful to Him. Actually, they were both needed and they were both used. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2QQxwzBoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> If Pharaoh had suddenly died after the first or second conflict, Moses’ job would have been cut short, and God would have lost His opportunity to show forth His power and to declare His name. Hence, God needed Pharaoh, and He needed him to stand throughout the twelve conflicts. God made Pharaoh strong to stand throughout these conflicts in order that His purpose might be fulfilled. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zFuxavzSXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> If we did not have the book of Exodus with its twelve conflicts between God and Pharaoh, we would not know God adequately with respect to His sovereignty. It is easy to know God’s love, but difficult to know His sovereignty. <span class="pg" data-page-id="241" id="241">[241]</span> Through the twelve conflicts and the ten plagues that transpired over a period of time, God’s sovereignty was made known. Throughout the course of Moses’ negotiations with Pharaoh, God came in to manifest His sovereignty. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgfDovSJvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> Sovereignty denotes absolute right, authority, and power. As the sovereign One, God has the right to do anything and to make any decision. Sovereignty is one of God’s attributes. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjIxAaixws7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> In His sovereignty God used Pharaoh in addition to using Moses. Without Moses, Pharaoh would not have been useful in this aspect. Likewise, without Pharaoh, Moses would not have been useful. Pharaoh and Moses were a match. One made the demands, the other resisted them, and neither budged even an inch. Each time Moses met with Pharaoh, Moses was more demanding and Pharaoh was more obstinate. Pharaoh was never subdued; he refused to give in. In the confrontation between these two we see a portrait of God’s sovereignty. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wNxsW3K_vl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> God’s sovereignty is also manifested in the plagues, which caused damage to human living conditions in Egypt. The blood ruined the water, and the frogs disturbed the Egyptians’ peace and comfort. In the plagues of the lice and the flies, the soil and the air were damaged. After the flies came the pestilence, and then the plague of the boils that broke forth with blisters. The plague of hail damaged the environment, and the locusts devoured all that remained after the severe damage caused by the hail. Finally, the plague of darkness made it impossible for anyone to move. But even after these nine plagues had passed, Pharaoh still was not subdued, although the entire environment related to human living in Egypt had been damaged. God continued to harden Pharaoh’s heart and to strengthen him that he might stand. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4YpK-JgqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> All this is not a question of God’s love, but of God’s sovereignty. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32535" data-verses="Romans 9:1">Romans 9</span> Paul does not deal with the love of God, but with the sovereignty of God. God’s sovereignty is especially seen in Pharaoh, and His mercy is seen in particular with Moses. Therefore, in the confrontation between Moses <span class="pg" data-page-id="242" id="242">[242]</span> and Pharaoh, we see a display of God’s sovereignty on the one hand and of His mercy on the other. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj9G5XHIF4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> While the angels were killing the firstborn of the Egyptians, God preserved the children of Israel and their beasts in peace and calm, even stilling the barking of the dogs. After Pharaoh was subdued by the slaughter of the firstborn, God still caused Israel to plunder the Egyptians of their gold, silver, and raiment. This was all under God’s sovereignty. </p>

Especially in ancient times, the firstborn represented the strong one and the most lovable one. Even today parents may lavish special care upon their firstborn child. In the tenth and last plague, the firstborn of the Egyptians and even the firstborn of their beasts were killed. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4fuYY04UiuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> When I was young, I disagreed with God regarding the slaughter of the firstborn. Now I can see that God did this according to His sovereignty. There was no need for Him to gain man’s approval before taking this action. He simply gave commandment to the angels, and they carried it out. Do not reason that in doing this God was not loving. Remember, according to the Bible, God is not only loving, but also sovereign. Elsewhere in the Scriptures we see that God is full of mercy and rich in kindness and forgiveness. The New Testament clearly declares that God is love. But the very God who is love came in, according to His sovereignty, to slaughter the firstborn. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP82pf5Bv8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32536" data-verses="Exodus 12:30">12:30</span> we are told that among the Egyptians there was “not a house where there was not one dead.” This slaughter took place at midnight (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32537" data-verses="Exodus 12:29">12:29</span>), the time when people usually enjoy the best sleep. That was the time the angels came to slay the firstborn, the strongest and most lovable ones in all the families in Egypt. By this last plague Pharaoh was subdued (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32538" data-verses="Exodus 11:1">11:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32539" data-verses="Exodus 12:21-30">12:21-30</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32540" data-verses="Exodus 12:33">33</span>). He and his servants rose up in the night and called for Moses and Aaron, telling them that they and the children of Israel should go forth out of Egypt <span class="pg" data-page-id="243" id="243">[243]</span> and serve the Lord. Pharaoh was subdued to such an extent he was willing to let all Israel go, not only with their little ones, but also with their flocks and herds (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32541" data-verses="Exodus 12:31-32">12:31-32</span>
). He even asked Moses and Aaron to bless him. He and all the Egyptians actually drove the children of Israel out of Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32542" data-verses="Exodus 12:33">v. 33</span>). The Egyptians were even willing to give the children of Israel whatever they asked. They were willing for the whole nation to be plundered by Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32543" data-verses="Exodus 12:36">v. 36</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2Fz84fSr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> God’s revelation in the Bible is presented in a practical way, not in the way of doctrinal understanding. Because the divine revelation comes in a practical way, it is always living. However, if it were given in a way of doctrine, the result would be death. In particular, the Passover is presented not as a doctrine, but in relation to a practical need. The Passover portrayed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32559" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span> is a clear, adequate, and even all-inclusive type of the redemption of Christ. Nowhere else in the Scriptures is the redemption of Christ presented in such a full way. </p>

However, not many have seen a clear picture of Christ as the redeeming Lamb of God. This picture is presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32561" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGv8JB4LvVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> You may not understand the significance of certain details in this picture. For example, why was the blood put on the lintel and the doorposts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32562" data-verses="Exodus 12:22">12:22</span>) rather than on the roof? Why did God tell the children of Israel to use a bunch of hyssop to sprinkle the blood on the lintel and doorposts? What was the reason for eating bitter herbs along with the flesh of the lamb? We could ask question upon question. Few Christians are able to answer questions such as these. <span class="pg" data-page-id="248" id="248">[248]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GmYF6ftZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> We all need to see a clear picture of Christ’s redemption. Although the New Testament reveals the various aspects of redemption, these aspects are not systematized in a doctrinal way. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32563" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span> says that Christ is the Lamb of God, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32564" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:7">1 Corinthians 5:7</span> Paul speaks of Christ as the Passover. Here and there in the New Testament we see aspects of Christ’s redemption. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32565" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span>, however, we have a complete picture. We need to consider this picture carefully; then to interpret it properly, we need to turn to other portions of the Word, especially to the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQa2QtszwAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> The Passover is a type of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32566" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:7">1 Corinthians 5:7</span> Paul says that “Our Passover, Christ, has been sacrificed.” Here Paul does not say that Christ is our lamb; he says that Christ is our Passover. But how could the Passover be sacrificed? The answer is that Christ is not only the Passover lamb but also every aspect of the Passover. The lamb, the bread, and the bitter herbs are all related to Christ. In principle, therefore, Christ is not only the lamb of the Passover, but the very Passover itself. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755Xz-jLj89jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> The word Passover means that the judgment of God passes over us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32567" data-verses="Exodus 12:13">Exodus 12:13</span> the Lord says, “When I see the blood, I will pass over you.” Eventually, the Passover became a proper noun in English. The proper noun Passover has its source in the words “pass over” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32568" data-verses="Exodus 12:13">12:13</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGtDTw6BePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> But why is Christ called our Passover? According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32569" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span>, God passed over the children of Israel because the blood of the Passover lamb had been sprinkled on the lintel and the doorposts of their houses. The children of Israel had been commanded to eat the flesh of the lamb in their houses. This indicates that the house was to be their covering under which and in which they could eat the flesh of the Passover lamb. The house that covered them was to have blood sprinkled on the lintel and the doorposts. When God saw the blood, He passed over the children of Israel. Hence, this passing over was due to the sprinkled blood. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJkvPKGKvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> With Paul, however, we see that the Passover is related not only to the blood, but to Christ Himself. Are we today <span class="pg" data-page-id="249" id="249">[249]</span> under the blood, or are we in Christ? Strictly speaking, to say that we are under the blood is not scriptural. This phrase is not found in the New Testament. But the New Testament says repeatedly that we are in Christ. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32570" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Corinthians 1:30</span>, it is of God that we are in Christ. Because we are in Christ, He Himself becomes our Passover. This means that before Christ can be our Passover, He must first be our covering. Our covering today is not the blood; it is Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32571" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span> the Passover was based on the blood. But today our Passover is based on Christ. This is the reason Paul could say that Christ is our Passover. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqH5hx-hhkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> If you were asked to list the items of the Passover in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32572" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span>, you would probably mention the lamb, the flesh, the blood, the unleavened bread, and the herbs. But probably you would not include the house. The house in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32573" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span> is a type of Christ. At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32574" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>, we see that God used skins to cover Adam and Eve (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32575" data-verses="Genesis 3:21">v. 21</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32576" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> Abel “brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof” and presented them to the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32577" data-verses="Genesis 4:4">v. 4</span>). Through this offering, Abel was accepted by God. Later we read that Noah was charged to build an ark, which may be regarded as a floating house. This ark was a type of Christ into whom we have been placed by God. Noah and his family entered into the ark and in it they were saved from the flood. These instances indicate that the revelation in the Bible is progressive. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32578" data-verses="Genesis 3:21">Genesis 3:21</span> we have the coats of skins; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32579" data-verses="Genesis 4:4">Genesis 4:4</span>, the offering of the firstlings of the flock; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32580" data-verses="Genesis 6:1-2">Genesis 6 and 7</span>, the ark made by Noah. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2Fz84YBr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> In the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob we do not have a clear record of redemption. For this, we must go to the experience of the children of Israel recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32581" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span>. Here is the full development of God’s redemption that is first indicated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32582" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32583" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> we have the skins, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32584" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> we have the offering, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32585" data-verses="Genesis 6:1-2">Genesis 6 and 7</span> we have the ark. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32586" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span> we have set before us the full development of God’s redemption. Here the ark becomes the house, a type of Christ, in which and by which <span class="pg" data-page-id="250" id="250">[250]</span> the children of Israel were covered. This is the reason that no verse in the New Testament says that we are under the covering of the blood of Christ. However, a number of verses, especially in the Epistles, indicate that we are in Christ. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32587" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">Galatians 3</span>, God has put us into Christ, and we are now in Christ. Because Christ is the house that covers us, He is our Passover. He is not only the lamb, the unleavened bread, and the herbs; He is also the house whose lintel and doorposts have been sprinkled with the redeeming blood. </p>

THE TIME OF THE PASSOVER</h2><p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9IkoJlJSHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> The time of the Passover is related to a certain month and a certain date. The Hebrew people had two calendars, a sacred calendar and a civil calendar. The civil calendar was common, whereas the sacred calendar was related to the experience of God’s salvation. We who believe in Christ also have two calendars, a civil calendar and a sacred calendar. Anyone who does not have a sacred age as well as a civil age is not a genuine believer in Christ and cannot share in Christ as the Passover. As God’s redeemed ones, we have had two births, two beginnings: a physical birth with a physical beginning and a spiritual birth with a spiritual beginning. I can testify that I have had a second beginning, the beginning in the divine life. On the day we believed in the Lord Jesus, our age according to the sacred calendar began. On that day we had a new birth and a new beginning. </p>

Originally, this month was the seventh month of the civil year. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32589" data-verses="Genesis 8:4">Genesis 8:4</span>, Noah’s ark landed on the mountains of Ararat on the seventeenth day of the seventh month. Many Bible teachers believe that this seventh month <span class="pg" data-page-id="251" id="251">[251]</span> was the first month of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32590" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span>. The Passover was on the fourteenth day of this month. This means it was held three days before the day that marked the landing of the ark on the mountains of Ararat. This landing of the ark was a type of the resurrection of Christ. Christ was killed on the fourteenth day, and He was resurrected on the seventeenth day. </p>

<p class="scripture" data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf4q_LouD2ndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr">Scripture Reading: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32644" data-verses="Exodus 12:11-28">Exo. 12:11-28</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32645" data-verses="Exodus 12:43-51">43-51</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32646" data-verses="Exodus 13:2-11">13:2-11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32647" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:7-8">1 Cor. 5:7-8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32648" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45a</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32649" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:47">47a</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoaQMbW05tP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> The record of the Passover given in Exodus is very detailed. Nowhere else in the Scriptures do we find such a detailed account of Christ’s redemption. The reason for all the detail is that God wants us to know the redemption of Christ in such a thorough way that we could never forget it. Twice the word memorial is used (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32650" data-verses="Exodus 12:14">12:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32651" data-verses="Exodus 13:9">13:9</span>). This indicates that it is God’s intention that we neither neglect the redemption of Christ nor forget it. Rather, we are to remember Christ’s redemption, not in a general way, but in a specific and detailed way. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVPi3NCZne1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> One of the details in the account of the Passover concerns the eating of the flesh of the lamb. The flesh of the Passover lamb signifies Christ’s crucified and resurrected life that is our supply. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32652" data-verses="John 6:53">John 6:53</span> the Lord Jesus said that if we would have life, we must eat the flesh of the Son of Man. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32653" data-verses="John 6:55">verse 55</span> He went on to say, “My flesh is true food.” Through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection Christ’s flesh has become our food. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJtzcO-3Hiqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> Another detail is related to the bones of the Passover lamb. The children of Israel were told in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32654" data-verses="Exodus 12:46">12:46</span> that none of the bones of the lamb used in the Passover were to be broken. This is of great significance. When the Lord Jesus was crucified, His bones were not broken (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32655" data-verses="John 19:33">John 19:33</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32656" data-verses="John 19:36">36</span>). This indicates that within Christ there is something unbreakable and indestructible. Christ’s unbroken bone signifies the life <span class="pg" data-page-id="262" id="262">[262]</span> that imparts life. This is typified by Eve being produced from Adam’s rib. Just as Adam’s bone could impart life into Eve to make her Adam’s counterpart, so Christ’s indestructible life has imparted life into us to make us His counterpart. Adam’s rib typifies Christ’s life that imparts life. In Christ there is a life signified by the unbroken bone of the Passover lamb. This life is Christ’s eternal, divine life that imparts life into us. </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRA9LKguxmTX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> We need to be deeply impressed with all the details of the Passover. As we consider these details, we realize that the account of the Passover is not simple or easy to understand. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4Yoq-JiqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN">IV. THE WAY TO APPLY THE PASSOVER LAMB</h2><p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj9G43HIH4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> In this message we shall consider the way to apply the Passover lamb. The Passover lamb is wonderful, but if we do not know how to apply it, the lamb will have little meaning in our daily subjective experience. Therefore, our concern in this message is with the subjective experience of Christ as the Passover. </p>

To Eat with Loins Girded,<br/>with Shoes on the Feet,<br/>with Staff in the Hand, and in Haste</h2><p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vVtStrhF6d_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32657" data-verses="Exodus 12:11">Exodus 12:11</span> says, “And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is Jehovah’s passover” (Heb.). As the children of Israel were eating the Passover lamb, they were like an army. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32658" data-verses="Exodus 12:51">Exodus 12:51</span> says that the Lord brought the children of Israel “out of the land of Egypt by their armies.” Not many Christians today realize that they should be an army. On the contrary, the prevailing concept seems to be that anyone who believes in the Lord Jesus should be placed in a palanquin and carried away to heaven. However, according to the picture in the book of Exodus, the redeemed ones applied the Passover in such a way that they could become God’s army. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4fuZ407VCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32659" data-verses="Exodus 12:11">12:11</span>, the children of Israel ate with their <span class="pg" data-page-id="263" id="263">[263]</span> loins girded. Before we were saved, we were somewhat loose; our being had not been girded up. To be girded is part of the preparation to be a soldier in the army. By girding ourselves we make ourselves ready to fight. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP83Jf6AP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> The gospel preached by many Christians today is not complete. When you heard the gospel, were you told to repent, believe in the Lord Jesus, receive Him, and then gird yourself up? Few of us were told that we needed to gird ourselves. However, the matter of being girded is here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32660" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span>. This record is complete. Only when we have girded our loins are we qualified to apply the Passover. If we are still loose, we cannot take the Passover in a proper way. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2jjjkmdlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> The children of Israel were also told to have shoes on their feet. This indicates that they were to make themselves ready for a journey. In an army all soldiers need proper shoes. Before we were saved, our feet were not shod. If we would fight the battle for the Lord, we need the right kind of shoes on our feet. I am sorry that the preaching of the gospel in today’s Christianity rarely includes a word about the need to have shoes on our feet in order to apply the Passover lamb. I hope that the Holy Spirit will speak to many concerning this. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3h2iJ92EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32661" data-verses="Exodus 12:11">12:11</span> the children of Israel were told to eat the Passover with their staff in hand. The staff was also to be used for the journey. In ancient times, when people went on a long journey, they often took a staff. The girdle, the shoes, and the staff were all for the journey that the children of Israel were about to make. This journey was not to be a journey of peace, but a journey of war, for, in a sense, they had to fight their way out of Egypt. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9tAOvN1w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> We thank the Lord that although we may not have heard about these things when the gospel was preached to us, many of us had some experience of them at the time we were saved. When we decided to take Christ as our Savior, inwardly we had the sense that we had been made ready for a long journey. This was my experience. It seemed to me that I had given up my former journey and was ready to start on <span class="pg" data-page-id="264" id="264">[264]</span> a new journey, to have a new life with a new beginning. Did you not have such an experience when you believed in the Lord? Were you not made ready for a new journey, a new walk? Perhaps you did not have words for it, but the Holy Spirit did equip you in such a way and did lead you into a journey of fighting. You realized that a new life, a new journey, had just begun. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC4zX4-H5C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> Finally, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32662" data-verses="Exodus 12:11">12:11</span> says that God’s redeemed people were to eat the Passover in haste. Because they had to flee from the land of Egypt that night, they were required to eat the Passover lamb hastily. Soldiers are often required to eat their meals quickly. Those who have been in the army realize that soldiers are trained to eat in this way. Because a battle lies ahead of us, we must eat the Passover lamb in haste. Do not excuse yourself by saying that you were born with a slow disposition. Those who are slow may be the first to be attacked by the enemy from the rear. Those who eat fast are probably those who are at the front of the army. </p>

To Touch the Lintel and the Two Side Posts<br/>with the Blood Applied by a Bunch of Hyssop</h2><p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8GKu1J3Rnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32663" data-verses="Exodus 12:22">Exodus 12:22</span> says, “And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and touch the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin” (Heb.). Notice that the blood was put on the entrance of the house, not on the roof. The function of the entrance is to allow the proper persons and things to come into the house. Anyone or anything that is not proper is shut out by the entrance. The fact that the blood of the Passover lamb was put on the lintel and the two side posts of the door implies that the blood opens the way for us to get into Christ, who is typified by the house. The redeemed ones come into the house, not through the roof or through a window, but through the door that has been sprinkled with the redeeming blood. Hallelujah, our entry into Christ has been guaranteed by His redeeming blood! Coming into <span class="pg" data-page-id="265" id="265">[265]</span> Christ through the door sprinkled with the blood, we receive a warm welcome. </p>

<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzININzQ7RdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> The redemption of Christ is mysterious, beyond our understanding. I believe that this is the reason the Passover in the Old Testament portrays all the elements, factors, and aspects of the redemption of Christ revealed in the New Testament. If we had the plain words of the New Testament without the picture in the Old Testament, it would be difficult for us to see all the details of the wonderful and mysterious redemption of Christ. How we thank the Lord for the portrait of redemption presented in the book of Exodus! </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqb-x6COT0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> In the foregoing messages, we have covered a number of details regarding the Passover. We have seen that Christ is not only the Passover lamb, but also the unleavened bread, the bitter herbs, and the house. The blood of the lamb was put on the lintel and the doorposts of the houses; and all the lamb, including the head, legs, and inwards, was eaten. As the children of Israel ate the lamb, it was necessary for them to have their loins girded, to have their feet shod, and to have a staff in their hands. Furthermore, they had to eat the lamb in haste. The lamb was not to be eaten either raw or boiled; it had to be roasted in fire. Moreover, hyssop, signifying faith, was used to put the blood of the Passover lamb on the lintel and on the doorposts. All these details had to be observed by the children of Israel as they were sharing in the Passover. In this message we shall go on to consider <span class="pg" data-page-id="274" id="274">[274]</span> some further details concerning the way to apply the Passover lamb. </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36SAlLCfhsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> The Passover itself lasted just one day. It was held on the fourteenth day of the first month, the month Abib. Continuing from the feast of the Passover, there was another feast, the feast of unleavened bread, which lasted seven days. In the Bible seven days indicate a complete course of time, a whole period of time. Hence these seven days signify the course of our life on earth. In the eyes of God, the full course of our life is just seven days. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0LyR21ZoJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> The feast of unleavened bread began and ended with days of feasting. Both on the first day and on the last day, no work was permitted. The children of Israel were only allowed to eat. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9IkpplJQHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> The details we shall cover in this message are especially crucial. What we have covered thus far is related to the feast of the Passover, which lasted for one day. But what we shall cover in this message is related to a feast that lasted for seven days, a period of time that signifies the course of human life. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGv9pBwZfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR">D.

For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32680" data-verses="Luke 22:1">Luke 22</span> speaks of the Lord eating the Passover with His disciples (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32681" data-verses="Luke 22:11">vv. 11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32682" data-verses="Luke 22:15">15</span>). There, the Passover is a feast for us to eat. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32683" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span> speaks of eating the flesh, unleavened bread, and bitter herbs. The significance of eating rests in the fact that we live by what we eat. In human life nothing is more important than eating. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnC7huRr9fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> The children of Israel were not to eat leavened bread for a period of seven days. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32684" data-verses="Exodus 12:15">Exodus 12:15</span> says, “Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32685" data-verses="Exodus 12:19">12:19</span>, no leaven was to be found in the houses, and according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32686" data-verses="Exodus 13:7">13:7</span>, <span class="pg" data-page-id="275" id="275">[275]</span> no leaven was to be seen with the children of Israel. During the days of the feast of unleavened bread, the children of Israel were not to eat leavened bread, leaven was not to be found in their houses, and leavened bread was not to be seen with them. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJG_i00PaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> Eating unleavened bread indicates that God’s people should not live in sin, that is, should not live a sinful life. In the Bible leaven signifies what is sinful, evil, corrupt, and unclean in the eyes of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32687" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:8">1 Corinthians 5:8</span> Paul speaks of the “leaven of malice and evil.” </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-DwuwsMx6qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> The function of leaven is to make something easier to eat. Suppose bread is made without yeast or any other type of leaven. This kind of bread would be heavy and hard to chew. But if leaven is put into bread dough, the bread will be soft and easy to eat. The function of sin is similar to the function of yeast; it softens things that are hard and makes them easier for us to take in. The principle of leaven, therefore, is to add an element that causes something hard to become soft. For example, joking may be a kind of leaven that makes a difficult situation easier to take. </p>

<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoaQMLWzpNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> The children of Israel were to observe the feast of unleavened bread as a continuation of the feast of Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32688" data-verses="Exodus 12:15-20">12:15-20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32689" data-verses="Exodus 13:6-7">13:6-7</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32690" data-verses="Exodus 12:18">Exodus 12:18</span> says, “In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.” We have pointed out that when the children of Israel ate the Passover lamb, they were also required to eat unleavened bread. We have seen that the feast of the Passover lasted one day, whereas the feast of unleavened bread continued for seven days. Therefore, the feast of unleavened bread was a continuation of the feast of Passover. <span class="pg" data-page-id="276" id="276">[276]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVPinNEJXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> The flesh of the Passover lamb signifies the sinless life of Christ. We received Christ not only in His death and resurrection, but also in His sinlessness, for His life is not only a crucified and resurrected life, but also a sinless life. Therefore, we must eat the flesh of the lamb and also the unleavened bread. This means that from the time we received Christ and were saved and had a new beginning in life, we began to live a life without leaven, a life without sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJtzce-9VCqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32691" data-verses="Exodus 13:7">Exodus 13:7</span> says that no leaven was to be seen with the children of Israel. In our Christian life no leaven should be seen. It is impossible for us to have no leaven at all, but it is possible for the leaven not to be seen. Although it is not possible for us to be without sin, we must deal with any sin that is manifested, with any sin that is seen. This means that we are responsible to deal with the sin of which we are conscious. Whenever we discover something sinful in our lives, we must eliminate it. This, however, does not mean that we shall have no sin. There may be much sin in our lives or in our environment, but we may not be conscious of it. However, as soon as we become conscious of it, we must deal with it. We must forsake the sin of which we are conscious. We should not tolerate any manifestation of sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRA9LagljWTX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32692" data-verses="Exodus 12:19">12:19</span> the children of Israel were given a strong word: “Whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.” To be cut off from the congregation of Israel was to be cut off from the fellowship of God’s chosen people. This serious word corresponds to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32693" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:13">1 Corinthians 5:13</span>: “Remove the evil man from among yourselves.” To put away such a one is to cut him off from the fellowship of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTN3hBVSdtP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> If we tolerate sin once it has been exposed, our fellowship will be cut off. This indicates that as Christians we should live a sinless life, not tolerating any sin that has been exposed.

However, if we read the words of the New Testament without considering the picture of the exodus presented in the Old Testament, we shall not be impressed very deeply. Hence, we need to consider both the words in the New Testament and the picture in the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_bXwl21ANcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> Often we are able to grasp spiritual things more adequately through pictures than through words. In New Testament terms, to have an exodus is to get out of the world. However, without the picture in the book of Exodus, it is difficult to say just how we are able to get out of the world. To talk about this matter without consulting the picture may lead only to confusion. Therefore, we thank the Lord both for the picture in the Old Testament and for the plain words in the New Testament. </p>

PHARAOH AND THE EGYPTIANS<br/>HAVING BEEN SUBDUED BY GOD</h2><p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9tAuvN3w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> The children of Israel did not make their exodus from Egypt of their own accord or by their own power. If they had been left to themselves, they never could have come out <span class="pg" data-page-id="290" id="290">[290]</span> of Egypt. The exodus was accomplished by the saving God. Firstly, God subdued Pharaoh, the one who had usurped the children of Israel, and then He subdued all the Egyptians (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32722" data-verses="Exodus 12:29-33">12:29-33</span>
). As we apply this principle to our experience, we see that God comes in to subdue Satan, everything and everyone that stands with Satan, and also our environment. When the children of Israel made their exodus from Egypt, the whole environment was subdued by God. Everything was set for the children of Israel to leave Egypt. Even if they had wanted to remain in Egypt, the environment would not have allowed them to remain. They had no choice except to leave. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC4zXY-H7C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> According to the picture in the book of Exodus, God’s salvation includes the aspect of the Passover and the aspect of the exodus. It was easy for God’s people to observe the Passover, but it was not easy for them to have an exodus. The difficulty lay in the fact that the exodus required a suitable environment. Suppose the situation in Egypt did not allow God’s people to leave. How then could they have made their exodus? It would have been impossible. The exodus required a thorough subduing of the environment. Israel’s exodus was the result of a long struggle between Moses and Pharaoh. It was preceded by twelve negotiations with ten plagues. This indicates that it is not easy for God to deliver His chosen people from the usurping hand of Satan and from the world. All genuine Christians have experienced the Passover, but only a small minority of believers have experienced the exodus. The reason for this is that certain aspects of their environment have not yet been subdued. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTbLAQBDXVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> If our environment has not been subdued, we may have the Passover, but not the exodus. Perhaps your wife, husband, or relatives need to be subdued. When some hear that their environment must be subdued, they may be discouraged and want to give up. However, not even the matter of giving up depends on us; it depends wholly on the Lord. Instead of giving up, we should cooperate with Him. To be <span class="pg" data-page-id="291" id="291">[291]</span> rescued from the usurping hand of Satan and from the world, we need God’s hand to subdue our environment. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8GKO1K3xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> In this record we are told twice that “by strength of hand” the Lord brought the children of Israel out of Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32723" data-verses="Exodus 13:3">13:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32724" data-verses="Exodus 13:14">14</span>). God’s people were saved not only by the blood of the Passover lamb, but also by the hand of God. The blood saved them from God’s righteous judgment, but the hand saved them from Pharoah’s usurpation. It is the same with us today. Through Christ as our Passover we are saved from God’s judgment, but by God’s subduing hand we are saved from Satan and the world. </p>

The Egyptians could not tolerate the presence of God’s people in their country any longer. When Moses and Aaron first asked Pharaoh to let God’s people go, Pharaoh refused. But by the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32728" data-verses="Exodus 12:33">12:33</span>, “the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste.” </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-2I8EYe089qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> This is not only a story in the Bible, but a principle that applies to our Christian experience. Sooner or later, our environment will encourage us, even compel us, to make our exodus from the world. Our wife, husband, or relatives may charge us to go out; they may tell us that it is better for us to leave the world than to remain in it. This means that the world will cast us out. If we are not willing to go, the world will drive us away. As long as we remain in the world, those in the world have no peace. Eventually they realize that only when we leave the world will they have peace and will we have joy. I can testify that this has been my experience. If I were to try to go back to the world, the world would beg me not to return. As far as the world is concerned, the farther away I am, the better it is. It is the result of the Lord’s strong hand that the world wants us to leave. <span class="pg" data-page-id="292" id="292">[292]</span> </p>

THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL HAVING NO TIME<br/>TO LEAVEN THEIR BREAD</h2><p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZXzD8-GcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> Because the children of Israel were driven out of Egypt, they had no time to bring leavened food (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32729" data-verses="Exodus 12:34">12:34</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32730" data-verses="Exodus 12:39">39</span>). We have pointed out that leaven signifies sinfulness and corruption. The fact that the children of Israel did not have the time to prepare leavened bread indicates that the Lord will deal with our environment to such an extent that it will give us no time for sinful things. If we still have time to prepare leavened bread, it will be difficult for us to get out of Egypt. This means that if we still have time for sinful things, it will be hard for us to make our exodus from the world. After God subdues our environment and causes us to be driven out of the world, we shall discover that no time remains for sinful things. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32731" data-verses="Exodus 12:39">Exodus 12:39</span> says, “And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were driven out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any food” (Heb.). This verse indicates clearly that the Egyptians did not give the children of Israel time to leaven their bread. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-bPQcLyIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> When I was a child in northern China, we ate a great deal of leavened bread. I learned that it takes much less time to bake unleavened bread than to bake leavened bread. Often before going to bed at night my mother would prepare dough with leaven and let it stand until morning. When my sister prepared the dough, sometimes she would forget to add leaven. In the morning, when my mother saw the situation, she would be displeased. She knew there was no time to make leavened bread, and she had to prepare something else for us to eat. This illustration shows that it takes time to prepare leavened bread. Just as it takes time to bake leavened bread, it also takes time to commit sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cB1rP1Tbw2edSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> Thirty years ago, many of us moved in haste from the mainland of China to Taiwan. The environment was such that we did not have any time to spare. If we had tarried, we would have found ourselves without any means of transportation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="293" id="293">[293]</span> Also, we were forced to leave many things behind. Before that time, we who ministered the Word tried to help certain people get rid of the “leaven” in their lives. But they were not willing to listen. Instead they held on to the sinful things, to the things that are “leaven” in the eyes of God. However, being forced to leave the mainland, they had no choice but to forsake all the “leaven.” When we arrived on the island of Taiwan, I was happy that so much “leaven” had been left behind. </p>

In the previous message we saw that Pharaoh and the Egyptians were subdued by God; then they drove the children of Israel out of Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32769" data-verses="Exodus 12:29-33">12:29-33</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32770" data-verses="Exodus 11:1">11:1</span>).

Furthermore, we saw that the children of Israel came forth from Egypt with their children and their flocks and herds (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32776" data-verses="Exodus 12:37-38">12:37-38</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32777" data-verses="Exodus 12:31-32">31-32</span>). Their dwelling in the Gentile land had lasted for a period of four hundred thirty years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32778" data-verses="Exodus 12:40-41">12:40-41</span>). The night of their exodus was a night of observation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32779" data-verses="Exodus 12:42">12:42</span>). Finally, when they made their exodus from Egypt, the children of Israel had become the armies of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32780" data-verses="Exodus 12:41">12:41</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32781" data-verses="Exodus 12:51">51</span>). Hence, in the words of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32782" data-verses="Exodus 13:18">13:18</span>, they came out of Egypt in martial array. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8GKe1Mlhnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> In this message we shall cover four additional points, all found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32783" data-verses="Exodus 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>. In contrast to the material covered in the foregoing message, these points are related to spiritual matters. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m5ELICF6SQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> It may seem that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32784" data-verses="Exodus 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> is an insertion between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32785" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">chapters twelve</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32786" data-verses="Exodus 14:1">fourteen</span> and that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32787" data-verses="Exodus 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> should be the direct continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32788" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">chapter twelve</span>. In a sense, this may be correct. However, from the standpoint of <span class="pg" data-page-id="304" id="304">[304]</span> spiritual experience, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32789" data-verses="Exodus 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> is not an insertion; it is a definite continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32790" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">chapter twelve</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh-3_qucYvIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> All the points in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32791" data-verses="Exodus 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> relate to spiritual experience on the positive side. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32792" data-verses="Exodus 13:2">13:2</span> speaks of the sanctification of the firstborn. Certainly this signifies a particular aspect of the spiritual experience of God’s people in coming out of Egypt. It indicates that the purpose of our exodus from the world is to be sanctified to the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoaQMrWzrNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32793" data-verses="Exodus 13:3-10">13:3-10</span> we read of a day of memorial held in the month of Abib. At the time of this memorial, the children of Israel were not to eat leavened bread. The day the children of Israel came out from Egypt was to be a day of unleavened bread and a day of memorial. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32794" data-verses="Exodus 13:3">13:3</span>, it was the eating of unleavened bread that was the memorial, the remembrance. The way to remember the exodus was to purge out all leaven. Hence, there are three things that go together: the day of remembrance, the unleavened bread, and the month of Abib. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVPiHNELXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32795" data-verses="Exodus 13:19">13:19</span> we read that “Moses took the bones of Joseph with him,” for Joseph had charged the children of Israel, saying, “God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.” It is significant that this detail is not mentioned either in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32796" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">chapter twelve</span> or in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32797" data-verses="Exodus 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>, but immediately after a verse that tells us how God led the people through the way of the wilderness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32798" data-verses="Exodus 13:18">v. 18</span>). As we shall see, God led them in a way contrary to what we would expect according to the natural concept. We would expect Him to take the short way, but instead He took a roundabout way. Furthermore, in the verses immediately following the record concerning Joseph’s bones, we are told that the Lord went before the children of Israel by day in a pillar of cloud and by night in a pillar of fire. Therefore, as we consider this chapter in the light of spiritual experience, we need to put together the matter of Joseph’s bones with the way of God’s leading. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJtzc---Viqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> Viewing this chapter as a whole, we see that it begins with sanctification and ends with the Lord’s presence as the <span class="pg" data-page-id="305" id="305">[305]</span> guide for His people. How marvelous! Let us now look at this wonderful chapter in detail. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRA9L6gmj2TX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO">IX. THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL HAVING BEEN<br/>SANCTIFIED UNTO JEHOVAH</h2><p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTN3hhVRcNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> Sanctification is based on redemption. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32799" data-verses="Exodus 13:2">Exodus 13:2</span> says, “Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.” The Lord required only the firstborn to be sanctified because they were the redeemed ones. This indicates that whatever or whoever is redeemed must also be sanctified. This principle applies to us as believers in Christ. Because we have been redeemed, we must also be sanctified. Otherwise, we shall remain in Egypt, in the world. If we desire to experience a genuine exodus from Egypt, we must be both redeemed and sanctified. No one can come out of Egypt without being sanctified unto the Lord. According to the divine requirement, all those who are redeemed must also be sanctified. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5bSZlOcEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> Redemption is for our security, whereas sanctification is for God’s purpose. If we are shortsighted, we may see only redemption, which is for our benefit. But if we have the proper discernment, we shall see that redemption must be followed by sanctification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32800" data-verses="Romans 6:22">Rom. 6:22</span>), which is for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FbWGXmSwPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> Because the firstborn had been redeemed by the Passover lamb, all the firstborn both of man and of beast had to be sanctified to the Lord. For the sanctification of the firstborn, the oxen and the sheep did not need another kind of animal to be substituted for them. They were clean animals, acceptable to the Lord as a sacrifice. However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32801" data-verses="Exodus 13:13">verse 13</span> says, “And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb.” Because donkeys are unclean in the eyes of God, they cannot be accepted by Him and they cannot satisfy Him. Therefore, the firstborn of a donkey had to be redeemed by a lamb. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr86_4SLe4pcJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> At this point, we need to raise a rather puzzling question. <span class="pg" data-page-id="306" id="306">[306]</span> Since the firstborn of a donkey had already been redeemed by the Passover lamb, why did it need to be redeemed again in sanctification? The answer is that even though a donkey had been redeemed, it was still an unclean animal. In order to be sanctified, to be offered on the altar to the Lord for His satisfaction, the donkey still had to be redeemed with a lamb. It was not qualified to be sacrificed to the Lord for His satisfaction. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjhbsNXNmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> We may apply this principle to our spiritual experience. As far as sanctification is concerned, we are not sheep or oxen; we are donkeys. Even though we have been redeemed, our natural man is still unclean in the eyes of God. Hence, in order to be sanctified to the Lord, we need Christ to be our substitute. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32802" data-verses="Exodus 13:13">verse 13</span> we are told that not only the firstling of the ass, but all the firstborn of man among the children of Israel had to be redeemed. This indicates that they had to be redeemed in sanctification. They needed redemption not only at the time of the Passover, but also for their sanctification. This means that a substitute was necessary both for redemption and for sanctification. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD4qjasbW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> The Passover lamb typifies Christ as our Redeemer. Through Him as our substitute, we have been redeemed. However, because we are still unclean and natural, we cannot be a living sacrifice for God’s satisfaction; we need Christ to be our substitute in sanctification. This picture indicates that both for our salvation and for our sanctification we need Christ to be our substitute. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzININTQ_D9BVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32803" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> Paul said, “It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” We need Christ not only for our redemption, but also for our living as a sacrifice to God. Although we have been redeemed, our nature has not yet been changed. As far as our nature is concerned, we all are “donkeys,” unclean in the eyes of God and therefore not acceptable to Him for His satisfaction. For this reason, we need Christ for our sanctification. Only by having Christ as our substitute can we be a living sacrifice to God that is acceptable and satisfying to Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="307" id="307">[307]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqb-R6Hcj0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> Most Christians realize only that they need Christ as their substitute for redemption. Not many realize that in order to be a living sacrifice to satisfy God, they also need Christ as their substitute in sanctification. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32804" data-verses="Exodus 13:13">13:13</span>, if a donkey was not redeemed, its neck was to be broken. This means that any firstling of a donkey that was not redeemed had to be put to death. Because many Christians do not take Christ as their substitute for sanctification, it is as if their “necks” have been broken; that is, spiritually speaking, they are dead. They do not practice taking Christ as their substitute for their living unto God. Instead, they offer themselves on the altar as if they could be a sacrifice acceptable to God. This is a serious mistake. God will never accept the natural man as a sacrifice. On the contrary, the “neck” of the natural man must be broken. </p>

<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTg7uAArQmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> God’s complete salvation for His chosen people includes the Passover, the exodus from Egypt, and the crossing of the Red Sea. The Passover signifies redemption; the exodus signifies the going out from the world; and the crossing of the Red Sea signifies baptism. A full salvation with all these aspects is exactly what we need and what we enjoy today. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8694azCM5Y6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> It was necessary for God to have such a person as Pharaoh for the accomplishing of these three aspects of salvation. Without him there would not have been the necessary environment, circumstances, and situations. If we see this matter, we shall praise the Lord for His sovereignty. Pharaoh’s opposition created an environment that made the Passover possible. We cannot say that Pharaoh was the source of the Passover. However, we can say that without him there would not have been the necessary environment for the institution of the Passover. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIENKIXxO3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> The Passover included provision for redemption, which the children of Israel needed because of their sins. The Passover, however, includes much more than redemption. Christians recognize the need for redemption, but they may not see the need for the Passover. During the night of the Passover, not only were the children of Israel saved, but the Egyptians and the evil power of darkness were judged. In a normal experience of salvation, we are redeemed, and the power of darkness within us and around us is judged. However, many Christians are not saved in a normal way. They experience redemption, but they do not experience God’s judgment of the power of darkness. <span class="pg" data-page-id="320" id="320">[320]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbAINtgBpHhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> We have seen that time after time Pharaoh struggled against the Lord, resisting His demand to let the children of Israel go. But the more Pharaoh struggled, the more he helped to bring about the environment that was needed for the accomplishment of God’s salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0SSwcJmx8Wf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> Although Pharaoh continually resisted God’s demands, Moses continued to negotiate with him. None of us would have exercised the patience required of Moses. We would probably have given up after the first few conflicts. This is often what we do as we deal with people today. For example, perhaps we are burdened for the salvation of a particular person. We may expect that anyone who has been chosen by God will turn to the Lord after we have contacted him a few times. But if he continues to resist the Lord, we may give up, thinking that it is a waste of time to pursue the matter further. Moses, on the contrary, was patient and persevering in his dealings with Pharaoh. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZXwj8-EcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> As a result of Moses’ contact with Pharaoh and of Pharaoh’s struggle against the Lord, the situation in Egypt became very tense. Eventually, the Passover became a necessity. When Pharaoh and the Egyptians had proved that they were wholly against the Lord, the time had come for the Lord to exercise His judgment upon the rebellious Egyptians and to deliver His people. As the children of Israel were enjoying the Passover, the Egyptians were suffering under the judgment of God. The Egyptians, however, had no right to blame God for this. They had brought the judgment of God upon themselves. They were responsible for producing the environment that required the institution of the Passover, with its redemption and its judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-bMwcLwIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> In a similar way, it was with the help of Pharaoh that God’s people made their exodus from Egypt. Otherwise, the children of Israel probably would never have left the land of Egypt. If Pharaoh and the Egyptians had been kind to them, they would have had no desire to leave Egypt. But Pharaoh’s oppression of the children of Israel created the environment for their exodus from Egypt and then made it necessary for <span class="pg" data-page-id="321" id="321">[321]</span> them to go. Eventually, Pharaoh drove God’s people out of Egypt. Hence, Pharaoh was used by God to accomplish the exodus of His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cB1rMVTYwWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> According to God’s ordination and His economy, in His salvation there is the need for baptism, which is signified by the crossing of the Red Sea. In order to accomplish this aspect of salvation, God did not lead His people directly into the land of Canaan, through the territory of the Philistines. Rather, as we pointed out in the foregoing message, He led them to take a roundabout way. He caused them to go southward and turn toward the Red Sea, seemingly toward a dead end. The Lord, however, knew what He was planning to do. His intention was to use the Red Sea to baptize His people and to bury Pharaoh and his army. If the children of Israel had gone directly into the land of Canaan through the territory of the Philistines, they would not have crossed the Red Sea, and the Egyptian army would not have been buried. Therefore, in the crossing of the Red Sea, God used Pharaoh once again, this time to create a situation to bring about the baptism of His people. By means of the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire, God led them to take a detour. As they marched behind the pillar that guided them, they were led to camp by the sea (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32844" data-verses="Exodus 14:2">14:2</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTg7uAE5AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32845" data-verses="Exodus 14:3">14:3</span>, the Lord knew that Pharaoh would say of the children of Israel, “They are wandering aimlessly in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in” (Heb.). In the eyes of the Egyptians, the Israelites were very foolish for taking such an indirect route. Thus, the situation of the children of Israel in the wilderness tempted Pharaoh to pursue them. Therefore, the encampment of the children of Israel by the sea and the pursuit by Pharaoh and his chariots produced an ideal environment for the baptism of God’s people and the burial of Pharaoh and his army. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8694azFfZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> According to the concept of the worldly people, many of us were wandering aimlessly during the period of time between our conversion and our baptism. Before we were saved, we had a definite goal, an aim in life. But after we <span class="pg" data-page-id="322" id="322">[322]</span> were saved, we apparently had no goal and had begun to wander aimlessly. We, of course, had a spiritual goal. But in the eyes of the worldly people we had no aim in life and were no longer clear about our future. This kind of aimless wandering often stirs up persecution. Others may accuse us of no longer knowing what we are doing or where we are going. Some may even think that we have lost our sanity. Many of us have undergone this kind of persecution. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIENKIRi-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> However, such persecution helps us to have a proper and thorough baptism. If we are not persecuted for apparently wandering aimlessly, our baptism may be a mere procedure with little significance. But if we are persecuted for having lost our goal, our baptism will be very meaningful. Hence, we must thank the Lord for this kind of persecution. I can testify that the best baptisms I have witnessed were of those who had been persecuted by relatives and friends. In these cases, the new converts had a great deal to bury when they were immersed. However, when there is no persecution, baptism may not be as meaningful, for when the new converts are buried, nothing else is buried with them. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbAINtgI6HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> When the children of Israel were baptized in the Red Sea, they brought the Egyptian army into the water with them. In principle, the same thing should take place whenever a new convert is baptized. The army of the world should be brought into the baptistry and buried in the waters of baptism. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0SSwcJuisWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> We have seen that Pharaoh was a help to the children of Israel in three aspects of God’s salvation. He helped them to have the Passover, to make their exodus from Egypt, and to have a thorough baptism. According to typology, this picture is comprehensive. If we consider the type and apply it to our situation today, we shall be able to help new believers to be baptized in a proper way. </p>

<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQa2SNs3iwajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> God’s full salvation includes the Passover, the exodus, and the crossing of the Red Sea. Through the Passover the children of Israel were saved from God’s judgment. When they were in Egypt, they were like the Egyptians; they were sinful and even worshipped idols (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32894" data-verses="Ezekiel 20:7-8">Ezek. 20:7-8</span>). Along with the Egyptians, they were under the righteous judgment of God. According to God’s righteous judgment, they were under the sentence of death. Therefore, the children of Israel needed the Passover lamb to be their substitute. Because the blood of the lamb had been applied to the doorposts of their houses, God in His righteous judgment could pass over them. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755Xz8DLku9jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> However, not only were the children of Israel under God’s judgment; they were also under the tyranny of Pharaoh. They had been usurped by Pharaoh to serve as slaves to carry out the purpose of the Egyptians. Hence, the children of Israel had two serious problems: God’s judgment and Pharaoh’s tyranny. Although the Passover was adequate to save them from God’s judgment, it was not effective to rescue them from the usurpation of the Egyptians. In order to be saved from Egyptian tyranny, the children of Israel needed the exodus and the crossing of the Red Sea. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGtBzw8TOPzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> If the children of Israel had had only the exodus but not the crossing of the Red Sea, their salvation would not have been secure. It would have been possible for them to return to Egypt. God was greatly concerned that the people might attempt to do this. Without the crossing of the Red Sea, <span class="pg" data-page-id="334" id="334">[334]</span> there would have been no separating line. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32895" data-verses="Exodus 13:17">13:17</span> the Lord expressed a concern lest the “people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt.” Later, at the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32896" data-verses="Numbers 14:4">Numbers 14:4</span>, some of the rebellious ones said, “Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.” Therefore, in order to have a thorough and absolute deliverance from Egypt, the children of Israel had to make their exodus and also cross over the separating line by passing through the Red Sea. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJktvKPZPAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> In His creation God prepared the Red Sea to serve as a baptistry for His chosen people. Then during the exodus He led the people to this baptistry. This was no accident; it was according to the plan of God. God wanted to bring His people into a situation where it was impossible for them to go back to Egypt. In this message we need to consider the significance of Israel’s crossing of the Red Sea. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqH5jR-pyUXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR">I.

The cloud here refers to the pillar, which was the Lord Himself as the One leading the people. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD4pDasZW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32898" data-verses="1Peter 3:20-21">First Peter 3:20 and 21</span> indicate that the passing of Noah’s ark through the flood was also a type of baptism. By the ark and through the water Noah and the members of his family were saved from God’s judgment and from the evil, corrupt, and condemned world. The same flood which judged the world also separated those in the ark from the world. After the flood waters had abated, Noah and his family found themselves in a new realm, in a new world, where they could serve God. The flood had separated them from the old realm and had brought them into a new realm. Immediately after coming out of the ark, Noah built an altar and offered sacrifice to the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32899" data-verses="Genesis 8:20">Gen. 8:20</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzINIOzQ8DdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> The principle is the same with the crossing of the Red Sea. In Egypt the children of Israel were involved with the <span class="pg" data-page-id="335" id="335">[335]</span> evil, corrupt, and condemned world and were under God’s judgment. The Passover, which typified Christ, saved them from God’s judgment, just as the ark, also a type of Christ, saved Noah and his family from God’s judgment. Furthermore, just as Noah’s family needed to be saved from the world through water, so the children of Israel also needed to be saved from Egypt through water. With the children of Israel we see both the blood and the water. The blood of the Passover lamb saved them from God’s judgment, and the water saved them from the tyranny of the Egyptians. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqb9x6EcD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> In contrast to the children of Israel, the vast majority of today’s Christians have been saved only by the blood and not also through the water. Many have been baptized in a ritualistic way, but such a baptism is not an experience of the saving, separating water. In the case of Noah’s family and that of the children of Israel, the water was a means both of salvation and of separation. If we had only the teaching of the New Testament without the pictures in Genesis and Exodus, we would not have a thorough understanding of baptism. It was through baptism that God’s people were saved from the slavery of Egypt and the tyranny of Pharaoh. In the same principle, it is through baptism that believers today are saved from the world and from the satanic power of darkness. (Later on we shall see that the baptism typified by the crossing of the river Jordan signifies the deliverance from the old man. In this message we are concerned only with the aspect of baptism typified by the crossing of the Red Sea.) </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36SDlLLMBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> Baptism makes our salvation secure. If we have only the Passover and the exodus without the crossing of the Red Sea, our salvation will not be secure. The crossing of the Red Sea of baptism seals our salvation. When we baptize new believers, we should help them understand the significance of baptism. We should tell them that after they have been saved through Christ as the Passover, they need to pass through the water which separates them from the world and from the power of darkness. <span class="pg" data-page-id="336" id="336">[336]</span> </p>

Hence, by being baptized unto Moses, the children of Israel actually were baptized unto Christ. Christ, not Moses, is the real leader. Moses was simply a figure of Christ. Today we who believe in Christ have been baptized unto Christ. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32901" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Galatians 3:27</span> speaks of being “baptized into Christ.” Having been baptized into Christ, we are now under the leadership of Christ. Before the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, they took Moses as their leader, but not to a very great extent. However, after they crossed the Red Sea, “the people feared Jehovah, and believed Jehovah, and his servant Moses” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32902" data-verses="Exodus 14:31">Exo. 14:31</span>, Heb.), for they had been baptized unto Moses. Likewise, we have been baptized not unto a denomination, practice, belief, or doctrine, but unto Christ, our Leader and our Head. </p>

When we were baptized, we were baptized into the Spirit. In one Spirit we were baptized into one Body. </p>

In the death of Christ, signified by the water of baptism, we are terminated and buried. When a new believer is baptized, he should realize that he is being baptized both into the Spirit and into the death of Christ. The Spirit should not be separated from Christ’s death. Just as the cloud and the sea were one, so the Spirit and the death of Christ are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wNxum3J-Pl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> The death of Christ deals with matters on the negative side, whereas the Spirit takes care of matters on the positive side. On the one hand, a number of negative things must <span class="pg" data-page-id="337" id="337">[337]</span> be dealt with. On the other hand, the believers need to be encouraged positively to go on with the Lord. Negatively, the water terminated Pharaoh and his army. Positively, the cloud was the means by which the children of Israel were led on their journey. Praise the Lord for both the negative and positive sides of baptism! When a new believer is baptized, all negative things are terminated and buried. Then the Spirit as a pillar of cloud leads him on in his journey with the Lord. </p>

<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnC6g-RvvPiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> We have pointed out that Exodus is a book of pictures that portray God’s salvation as revealed in the New Testament. This salvation is spiritual, mysterious, and related to the divine life. Without the pictures in the book of Exodus, it would be difficult for us to have a firm grasp of the meaning of God’s salvation. Therefore, in His wisdom, God uses the pictures in Exodus to depict His salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJH-y0zc6oTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> The crossing of the Red Sea marked the completion of the first stage of God’s salvation of His chosen people. This stage includes three items: the Passover, the exodus, and the crossing of the Red Sea. The Passover is related to God’s judgment. Through the enjoyment of the Passover lamb, His people were saved from the judgment of God. The exodus is related to the tyranny of Pharaoh and to enslavement in Egypt. God’s people were not only under His judgment; they were also under the tyranny of Pharaoh. For this reason, they needed the Passover and the exodus as well. By means of the exodus, the people were delivered from Pharaoh’s tyranny and from Egyptian slavery. The crossing of the Red Sea is related to the destruction of the Egyptian army, which perished in the waters of the sea. Through these three aspects of God’s salvation, the children of Israel were saved from God’s judgment, from the tyranny of Pharaoh, and from the army of the Egyptians. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-Dwvx8M3paQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> We have seen that the crossing of the Red Sea signifies baptism. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32945" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:2">First Corinthians 10:2</span> says that the children of Israel were all “baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="346" id="346">[346]</span> sea.” Hence, the crossing of the Red Sea was a full type of baptism in the New Testament. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32946" data-verses="Romans 6:4">Romans 6:4</span>, baptism ushers the believers into resurrection. In baptism we are placed into Christ’s death and buried with Him. In this way we are also resurrected in Christ and with Christ. The result is that we “walk in newness of life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32947" data-verses="Romans 6:4">Rom. 6:4</span>), that is, in resurrection life. All those who have been baptized into Christ should walk in resurrection. To be in resurrection is to be in another realm, in a realm that is beyond death. Just as the Red Sea was the separating line between Egypt and the wilderness, so the death of Christ realized by baptism is the separating line between the old realm and the realm of resurrection. Baptism separates us from the world and brings us into the realm of resurrection. </p>

THREE DAYS’ JOURNEY FROM THE RED SEA<br/>IN THE WILDERNESS OF SHUR</h2><p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf4r-LoiD2ndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32948" data-verses="Exodus 15:22">15:22</span>, “Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness.” In the writings of Moses the wilderness has both a positive and a negative significance. However, most Christians have heard only that there is a negative significance. Many readers of Exodus may be surprised when they hear that the wilderness in this verse signifies resurrection. In order to understand this adequately, we need the proper knowledge of the Bible and some amount of spiritual experience as well. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYOADIJAazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> The Red Sea was created by God as a baptistry for the children of Israel. This means that even in His creation God made some preparations to signify the salvation of His people. The geographical features signify spiritual things. Africa is on the west side of the Red Sea, and Asia is on the east side. The word Shur means a wall, and the name Migdol, mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32949" data-verses="Exodus 14:2">14:2</span>, means a fortress. According to some historians, there was a separating wall to protect the land of Egypt, a wall that began at the Mediterranean Sea and ended at Shur. After the children of Israel had crossed <span class="pg" data-page-id="347" id="347">[347]</span> the Red Sea, for three days they journeyed in the wilderness of Shur (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32950" data-verses="Exodus 15:22">15:22</span>
). The pillar of cloud led them to the south, toward Marah. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l8C0gAOMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> In order to know the spiritual significance of these geographical facts, we need to consider this portion of the Word according to the revelation in the New Testament and also according to our experience. We have pointed out that baptism ushers the believers into resurrection. We have also pointed out that the Red Sea was the baptistry in which the children of Israel were baptized. Hence, after they were baptized in the Red Sea, they were brought into resurrection. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32951" data-verses="Exodus 3:18">3:18</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32952" data-verses="Exodus 5:1">5:1</span>, Moses told Pharaoh to let the children of Israel go so that they might make a journey of three days into the wilderness and there sacrifice to the Lord their God and hold a feast unto Him. This journey of three days signifies resurrection. This means that it is in resurrection that the people of God were separated from Egypt. Hence, the wilderness is a realm of separation. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBjvT7yNFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> Now we must go on to see that the wilderness also signifies the realm of resurrection. We say this according to the New Testament revelation regarding baptism and also according to our experience. Baptism brings us into resurrection. As soon as a believer is baptized, he has the sense that he has been brought out of the old realm into a new realm, the realm of resurrection. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32953" data-verses="Romans 6:4">Romans 6:4</span> says that, having been baptized into Christ, we should walk in newness of life. No doubt, to walk in newness of life means to live in the realm of resurrection. According to the type in Exodus, this realm is the wilderness of Shur. Thus, the wilderness of Shur is a type of the realm of resurrection. As we have seen, it also signifies a realm of separation. When the children of Israel entered into this realm, they were separated from Egypt both by the Red Sea and by the wall. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Bnszj9qck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> We are told in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32954" data-verses="Exodus 15:22">15:22</span> that the children of Israel “went three days in the wilderness.” Since three is the number of resurrection, this signifies that they walked in resurrection, that is, in newness of life. It is significant that the journey <span class="pg" data-page-id="348" id="348">[348]</span> from the Red Sea to Marah was exactly three days, not two days, four days, or even three and a half days. According to a note
in the text of the Amplified Version, the distance from the Red Sea to Marah was thirty-three miles. Surely the children of Israel could have walked this distance in less than three days. We must believe that the pace of their travel was under God’s sovereign leading and control. The fact that they traveled for three days is a portrait of walking in resurrection. When the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they certainly walked in a way that was different from the way they walked in Goshen. In Goshen they did not have the pillar of cloud, but in the wilderness they walked according to the guidance of this pillar. They were led by the Lord’s presence to walk in a new way. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GnY16fsZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> Perhaps you are wondering why the Bible uses the wilderness to signify resurrection, for we do not usually think of resurrection as a wilderness. To those who have been baptized into Christ, resurrection is not a wilderness. But it is a wilderness in the eyes of the worldly people. After we were baptized, our relatives and friends may have thought that we entered into some kind of wilderness. Before we were baptized, we were in Egypt enjoying the Egyptian “garlic,” “leeks,” and “onions,” and our relatives and friends were happy with us. But by believing in the Lord Jesus and by being baptized, we were brought into a new realm, which our relatives and friends considered to be a wilderness. But in the eyes of God this wilderness is actually a realm of resurrection. If we have the heavenly view, we shall realize that the realm we entered through baptism is not a wilderness, but a realm of separation and resurrection. In this realm we walk in resurrection according to the Lord’s guidance. Praise the Lord that in His creation God prepared even the geographical features in order to present a picture of His salvation! </p>

<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5aT5lKP0fCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> After the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, the pillar of cloud led them to Marah, and then to Elim. If we study a map, we shall see that they did not journey in a way that was according to the human concept, but in a way that was according to the divine concept. We have pointed out that when the children of Israel made their exodus from Egypt, God did not lead them through the way of the land of the Philistines (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32985" data-verses="Exodus 13:17">13:17</span>). Instead, He “led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="32986" data-verses="Exodus 13:18">13:18</span>). God deliberately led them to the south so that they could be baptized in the Red Sea, the baptistry He had prepared for them in His creation. Having crossed the Red Sea, they did not journey northward to the land of Canaan. God led them southward to Marah. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FbXH3mVjPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> Remember that it was God Himself in the pillar that led the people on their journey. He led them to take a way altogether different from that which is according to the natural concept. If we had been there, we probably would have said, “Moses, where are we going? Are we on our way to the good land, or to Arabia?” To such questions, Moses might have replied, “I do not choose the way we take. The pillar is guiding us. Just three days ago, this pillar protected us from Pharaoh’s armies. Don’t you think we should trust in this pillar and follow its leading?” No doubt, the children of Israel expected to be led northward, to the good land; <span class="pg" data-page-id="358" id="358">[358]</span> however, God led them southward, to Marah and to Elim. By this we see that God’s way is different from ours. </p>

We all know that death ushers us into resurrection. However, our concept is that this experience of resurrection will be on a way that is upward, not on a way that leads downward. In our opinion, any way that leads downward is not in resurrection. Yes, in itself resurrection takes us upward, but its application requires us to take a way that leads in a downward direction. When we are in the heavenlies, we do not sense the need for resurrection. But when we are in a low situation, we become conscious of the need for resurrection life. When we are in death, even in a tomb, we need resurrection. For this reason, the experience of Elim is in a downward direction from Marah. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD5rDakLm2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> As we consider the spiritual significance of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="32987" data-verses="Exodus 15:27">15:27</span> according to our experience, we need to be reminded not to study the Word of God in a superficial way. We should study the Word according to the way of life, according to the way the Lord Jesus applied the Old Testament Scriptures in the Gospels. This way is deep. Although this account is very short, only one verse long, we need to take the time to study in a thorough way Israel’s experience at Elim. Then we shall begin to see the riches implied in this verse. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zEuBavySXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> We have pointed out that instead of northward, the direct way to the land of Canaan, the children of Israel journeyed southward. No doubt, the good land was higher in elevation than the land of Egypt. But the way into this elevated land was downward, down to the south. This indicates that to reach a high destination we need to take a downward way. </p>

Although their lack of faith was a factor later, it was not the reason for their southward journey here. If they had not gone to the Red Sea, they could not have passed through the baptistry God had prepared for them. They had to pass through water in order to be saved from the tyranny of Pharaoh and the Egyptians. The blood of the Passover lamb saved them from God’s judgment, but the water of the Red Sea saved them from the armies of Pharaoh. They were led to the Red Sea, not because they were weak in faith, but because they needed to be baptized. As we have pointed out, even after they had crossed the Red Sea, they did not immediately journey northward. Contrary to our expectation, the pillar of cloud led them downward from Shur to Marah. After their experience at Marah, the pillar continued to lead them downward to Elim. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wNwsm3K-vl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> Israel’s experience at Marah signifies the experience of the cross. After we have an experience of the cross, we may expect to go upward. However, we shall go downward once again, for the experience of resurrection is in a downward direction. If you go upward instead of downward, you will not experience resurrection. Some Christians think that God leads His people only upward, never downward. But according to the picture in Exodus, the pillar of cloud led the children of Israel downward from Marah to Elim. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4Zp6-JjqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> I can testify that the journey from Marah to Elim corresponds to my spiritual experience. After I have experienced the crucified life, I often expected to be in an upward situation. But just the opposite has taken place many times. God led me downward, into a situation that was lower and even more difficult to bear. We should not be frightened by this. If we follow the pillar of cloud in a downward direction, we shall arrive at Elim, where there are twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees. This is the experience of resurrection which issues from the experience of the cross, the experience at Marah. <span class="pg" data-page-id="360" id="360">[360]</span> </p>

It is derived from a root that means mighty or strong. According to a number of scholars, this word also means a grove of palm trees. The first meaning may be applied to the twelve springs, and the second, to the seventy palm trees. At Elim there were twelve mighty springs flowing and seventy palm trees growing. What a picture of resurrection life! </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vVsT9rhE6d_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> Consider the twelve springs flowing and the seventy palm trees growing. The springs were flowing forth, and the trees were growing upward. No doubt the palm trees at Elim were not dwarf palms, but giant palm trees reaching high into the air. Certainly the water from the springs flowed downward. Therefore, at Elim we have the water flowing downward and the trees growing upward. This is a picture of resurrection life flowing out of God into us and then growing up from within us. Firstly, resurrection life flows from God into us. The result of this inflow is that something grows within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4fvYo07WCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> We have pointed out that in His creation God prepared the Red Sea to serve as the baptistry in which His people were baptized. Now at Elim we see God’s plantation. God created the twelve springs of water, but He planted the seventy palm trees. Hence, the springs are related to God’s creation, and the palm trees, to His plantation. The principle is the same in the church life today. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP92Zf6DP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> Everything related to the experience at Elim was sovereign of the Lord. In His creation God prepared the springs, and in His natural plantation He prepared the palm trees. Certainly it was no accident that the children of Israel came to Elim and found there twelve springs and seventy palm trees. Why were there not eleven springs and sixty-nine palms? The answer is that in His sovereignty God placed twelve springs and seventy palm trees at Elim for a specific purpose. When we follow the Lord as the pillar of cloud, we <span class="pg" data-page-id="361" id="361">[361]</span> shall come to a place of twelve springs flowing and seventy palms growing. </p>

After the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, the Lord led them to Marah. There the people murmured because the waters were bitter. Instead of being angry with the people for their murmuring, the Lord showed Moses a healing tree that changed the bitterness into sweetness. Just three days earlier, God’s people had experienced His salvation at the Red Sea. Pharaoh’s army had been destroyed, and the people had been rejoicing with praises to the Lord. However, at Marah it seems that the people forgot their experience at the Red Sea. Nevertheless, realizing that His people were children and that this was the first instance of their murmuring, the Lord did not punish them. Instead, He changed the bitter waters into sweet waters. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zEuxaogyXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> From Marah, the people were led by the Lord to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water flowing and seventy palm trees growing. The experience of God’s people at Elim must have been very exciting. Whenever we come to an Elim in our spiritual experience, we also are very excited.

On the one hand, after day there is night. On the other hand, after night there is a new day. In our experience with the Lord we need both the day and the night.

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33023" data-verses="Exodus 16:8">verse 8</span>, Moses said to the people, “Jehovah heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah” (Heb.). Moses was very displeased with the people because of their murmurings. He was much more displeased than the Lord Himself was. The Lord charged Moses to tell the people that they would see His glory in the morning (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33024" data-verses="Exodus 16:7">v. 7</span>).

My burden is to point out that after the marvelous experience at Elim, the flesh of the children of Israel still remained. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="371" id="371">[371]</span> same is true with us in our spiritual experience. After having an exciting experience at Elim with the twelve flowing springs and the seventy growing palms, we still are troubled by the flesh. The living water at Elim does not wash away the flesh. This is the reason that the so-called Pentecostal experiences do not deliver us from the flesh. Believers may experience the baptism of the Spirit or the so-called second blessing, but they still have the problem with the flesh. Even the genuine experience of the baptism of the Spirit is nothing more than the experience at Elim. As the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33026" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>
indicates, the experience at Elim does not solve the problem with the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7TkJOYWYe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> By this we see, once again, that the book of Exodus is not written according to doctrine, but is written according to spiritual experience. According to doctrinal understanding, the experience of the twelve flowing springs and seventy growing palm trees at Elim should cause us to become mature saints. But the exciting experiences at Elim never have this result. The murmuring of the children of Israel in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33027" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> proves this. They had been redeemed and delivered from Egypt, they had experienced the healing of the waters at Marah, and they had enjoyed the springs and the palms at Elim. But after all these experiences they could still exhibit the behavior shown in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33028" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>. If we view this from the perspective of doctrine, we shall find it difficult to understand. But if we look at it from the viewpoint of our experience, we shall find <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33029" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> easy to understand. According to our spiritual experience, we realize that the exciting times at Elim never cause the believers to become mature saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9IloZlJRHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> After we have an experience at Elim, the Lord will expose the flesh of our natural being. This is the reason that even after we have the exciting experience of the twelve springs flowing and the seventy palm trees growing, we find that we are still living according to the flesh. The twelve springs quench the thirst in our spirit, but they do not cause our flesh to be put to death. In fact, the more we experience the <span class="pg" data-page-id="372" id="372">[372]</span> flowing springs, the more our flesh will be exposed. If your intention is to conceal your flesh, you will have to avoid the experience of the springs and the palms at Elim. The experience of the twelve springs at Elim is always followed by an exposure of the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGu8ZBwYfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> Years ago, I read some books that talked about the experience of the baptism of the Holy Spirit and of the so-called second blessing. These books claimed that once a believer had such an experience, all his problems would be solved. Certain books went so far as to say that sin would even be eradicated. However, our actual experience proves that these claims are false. After we enjoy the living water at Elim, our flesh is exposed. It has no place to hide. In our experience, there is inevitably the turn from day to night. We are powerless to lengthen the day or to keep the night from coming. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPS93kquJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> It is important for us to see through the superficiality of today’s Christianity. Many Christians talk about the experience of the baptism of the Spirit. But even those genuine experiences of the baptism of the Spirit at most are the experience at Elim. We have pointed out that these experiences may quench our thirst, but they do not deal with our flesh. To the contrary, they actually cause the flesh to be exposed all the more. This was the reason that after their experience at Elim, the flesh of the children of Israel remained and was exposed. It had not changed in any way. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnC6geRr8fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> In like manner, although we may have exciting experiences of the twelve springs at Elim, we shall soon discover that we ourselves are unchanged. To quench the thirst in our spirit is one thing, but to deal with the fleshly aspect of our natural being is another. Do not expect the twelve springs at Elim to change what you are in the flesh. I am burdened that we be deeply impressed with this crucial point. If we are clear about this, we shall be freed from the influence of the erroneous concept that prevails in Christianity today. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJH-S00MaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> Because our flesh remains after the experience at Elim, <span class="pg" data-page-id="373" id="373">[373]</span> we need to be led on by the Lord from Elim into the wilderness described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33030" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">Exodus 16</span>. This wilderness is not a specific place. We are simply told that it was the wilderness between Elim and Sinai. This indicates that after we drink of the living water at Elim, we shall be brought into a situation which is indefinite. In this kind of indefinite place our flesh will be exposed. </p>

The first is that God wants to be everything to His chosen people. He wants to work Himself into those whom He has predestinated unto Himself. Second, since God wants to be everything to us, He does not want us to do anything. Rather, He wants to do everything for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2iiTkhOlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> As we apply these two matters to the book of Exodus, we see that it was God Himself who dealt with Pharaoh and the Egyptians. God did not ask the children of Israel to fight in order to be released from Egyptian tyranny. God did everything to bring about the total defeat of the Egyptians. When Moses confronted Pharaoh, all he had was a rod, a dead stick. It was God who did everything for His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3g3SJ7lUyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> Consider what God did for His people within less than forty days. He sent the plagues upon the Egyptians, and on the night of the Passover He slew the firstborn. Then He delivered the children of Israel from the hand of Pharaoh and brought them through the Red Sea, in which the Egyptian army was drowned. Furthermore, God brought the people to Marah, where He changed the bitter water into sweet water. Then He led them onward to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees. </p>

Therefore, the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33080" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> describes what took place just thirty-one days after the Passover. When I first realized this, I was very surprised. During this short period of time, God’s people had seen a number of miracles. However, they were not adequately impressed with the Lord’s sufficiency. The Passover was a great event, and the crossing of the Red Sea was even greater. Furthermore, the experiences at Marah and at Elim were significant. Nevertheless, when the people came to the wilderness of Sin and murmured and lusted after the fleshpots of Egypt, it seems as if they had had no experience at all. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4fvYI07UCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> Not many readers of Exodus have given adequate attention to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33081" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>. Actually this chapter is greater than either <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33082" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">chapter twelve</span> or <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33083" data-verses="Exodus 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33084" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">chapter twelve</span> we have the Passover, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33085" data-verses="Exodus 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> the crossing of the Red Sea, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33086" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> the eating of the manna. The eating of manna signifies that God’s people had reached the point where they had begun to be a heavenly people, a people whose nature had begun to be transformed with the heavenly element. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP925f6BP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> Many of the miracles in the Scriptures were carried out with the physical things of God’s creation. For example, the Lord Jesus fed the multitude with loaves and fishes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33087" data-verses="Matthew 14:19">Matt. 14:19</span>). But can we say that the manna in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33088" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> was an item of God’s old creation? No scholar can tell us what was the substance or element of manna. Whatever the substance of manna was, surely it did not belong to the old creation. In God’s old creation there is no such thing as manna. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2iiTkmclAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33089" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> there are two miracles: the sending of the quails and the sending of manna. The quails belong to the old creation. A wind went forth from the Lord and brought quails (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33090" data-verses="Numbers 11:31">Num. 11:31</span>). This was no doubt a miracle, but it made use of natural and physical things. The sending <span class="pg" data-page-id="387" id="387">[387]</span> of the manna, however, was different. Manna came from heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33091" data-verses="Exodus 16:4">Exo. 16:4</span>). Although we know that manna came from heaven, we do not know what the element of manna was. We cannot say what was the essence of manna, but we do know that it was food of a category different from all earthly food. To partake of manna was to have a heavenly diet. This heavenly food did not belong to the old creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3g3SJ93EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> People invariably live according to what they eat. Dietitians tell us that we are what we eat. For example, if we eat a great deal of fish, we shall become a composition of fish. Day by day for a period of forty years, the children of Israel ate manna. As a result, they became constituted with manna. We may even say that they became manna. Although we do not know the essence of manna, we know that it was the kind of food that caused people to become heavenly. By eating such heavenly food we become heavenly people. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9sB-vN2w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> By giving His people manna to eat, God indicated that His intention was to change the nature of His people. He wanted to change their being, their very constitution. They had already undergone a change of location. Formerly they were in Egypt. Now they were with the Lord in the wilderness, a place of separation. However, it is not sufficient merely to have a change of location, for this is too outward and too objective. There must also be an inward, subjective change, a change of life and nature. The way for God to produce such a change in His people is by changing their diet. By eating Egyptian food God’s people had been constituted with the element of Egypt. The element of the world had become their composition. When they were in Egypt, they did not partake of anything heavenly, for everything they ate was according to the Egyptian diet and was Egyptian in nature. Although God’s people had been brought out of Egypt into the wilderness of separation, they were still constituted with the element of Egypt. Now God’s intention was to change their element by changing their diet. He did not want them to eat anything that came from a worldly source. <span class="pg" data-page-id="388" id="388">[388]</span> They were no longer allowed to eat Egyptian food. God wanted to feed them with food from heaven in order to constitute them with the heavenly element. His desire was to fill them, to satisfy them, to saturate them with food from heaven, and thereby to make them a heavenly people. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC4yWI-H6C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> Before God sent manna from heaven, He sent the quails (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33092" data-verses="Exodus 16:13">16:13</span>). The quails caused the people to be even more fleshly. The nature and substance of the quails corresponded to the nature and substance of the children of Israel. Manna, however, did not, for it was of another category, of another kingdom and realm. Thus, by sending manna God showed that His intention was to change the composition of His people. He is not satisfied with a mere change of place. There must also be a change of constitution. We, God’s people today, are a composition of earthly things, a composition of the Egyptian element. Hence, God’s goal is not simply to change our behavior; it is to change our inward being, the very inner fabric of our constitution. Although we have been constituted with the substance of Egypt, God intends to constitute us with a heavenly element. It is vital for all of us to see this. </p>

There is no matter in the whole book of Exodus more crucial than this. In the past we have seen the importance of the Passover in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33128" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">chapter twelve</span>. The Passover implies redemption and regeneration, for with the Passover we have the blood of the lamb for redemption and the meat of the lamb for life. Hence, with the Passover we have redemption and life, two basic matters. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33129" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span>, however, we do not see the crucial matter of the change of diet. God’s intention is to change our constitution; that is, He intends to reconstitute us. Not many readers of this book have seen that the reconstitution of God’s people is implied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33130" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>. The main point in this chapter is that God intends to reconstitute His redeemed people by changing their diet. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZWzj85W8JlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> Exodus presents a clear picture of God’s salvation, a picture that is not found in any other book of the Bible, including the Epistles of Paul. This picture shows us that in God’s salvation He desires to work Himself into us to be everything to us. God intends to be our everything so that we can be built up as His dwelling place on earth. To portray this, Exodus concludes with the setting up of the tabernacle as the dwelling place for God’s glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-aPwcNi4s4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> For the fulfillment of His purpose, God does not want His redeemed people to be anything or to do anything. In order that we may be His dwelling place, He wants to be everything to us and do everything for us. This indicates that we are to <span class="pg" data-page-id="400" id="400">[400]</span> be nobody and to do nothing. Are you willing to be a nobody? Are you also willing to cease from your doing? I doubt that very many believers can answer these questions in a positive way. When we were living in the world, we had no heart for the Lord, and we did not care to do anything for Him. But after we came into the Lord’s recovery, we immediately had the desire to become something and to do something for the Lord. This is true of young and old alike. The older ones have many plans, and the young ones have a great deal of desire and energy. Although we want to be something and to do as much as possible, God would say, “I don’t want you to be anything, and I don’t want you to do anything. Let Me do everything for you and be everything to you.” </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cB1qPVTRiWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> As we consider the picture of God’s salvation presented in Exodus, we see that the children of Israel were not to be anything or to do anything. Whenever they did something, the Lord was offended, even when they did something good. The Lord simply wanted the people to be in His hand so He could work Himself into them. If we have a clear understanding of this, we shall have a solid basis to understand the book of Exodus. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTh4uAMrQmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> When we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33131" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>, we see the importance of being reconstituted. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33132" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">chapter twelve</span> God’s people were redeemed, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33133" data-verses="Exodus 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> they were delivered. But although they had been redeemed, saved, rescued, delivered, and freed, and although their needs had been supplied, there was still the need for them to be reconstituted. God’s people need a new constitution. The main point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33134" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> is not redemption, deliverance, or even supply. The focal point of this chapter is reconstitution through a change of diet. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJH_y00OaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> Although the children of Israel had been redeemed and delivered, they were still Egyptian in their constitution. The cells and the fibers of their being were Egyptian in nature. As far as constitution is concerned, there was no difference between them and the Egyptians. The children of Israel had been saved, redeemed, rescued, and supplied, but their constitution was altogether the same as the Egyptians. God <span class="pg" data-page-id="401" id="401">[401]</span> could never use such material for His heavenly dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-Dwvw8Mx7qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> God’s desire is to use His people as the material for the building of His habitation on earth. However, although the people were no longer in Egypt, they were still Egyptian in their constitution. Their tissue was Egyptian. They were a composition of the Egyptian element, for they grew up in Egypt and were raised on the Egyptian diet of cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic. Everything they ate was Egyptian. God’s intention is not to bring a number of redeemed Egyptians into the heavens. He may deliver from Egypt those who have an Egyptian constitution, but He will not bring such people into His dwelling place. In order to be the material for His habitation, His people must be reconstituted. Like the children of Israel, we today have been delivered out of Egypt, out of the world, but in our nature and constitution we are still worldly. Therefore, it is necessary for us to grasp the crucial point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33135" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> concerning the change of constitution. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNFb-oHDbKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> By the time God brought His people into the wilderness, He was ready to change their constitution. This was the reason He did not immediately supply them with food. When they marched out of Egypt, they carried with them a certain amount of Egyptian foodstuffs. This food supply sustained them for about a month. When their Egyptian food was consumed, the people were in need. Although God knew their need, He did not act immediately to meet it. This is often God’s principle in dealing with us. He knows that He must do something for us. But He refrains from doing anything because He realizes that if He acted prematurely, we would not get exposed. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33136" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">Exodus 16</span> God waited quietly behind the scene until the children of Israel were exposed. After they had eaten the last of the Egyptian food and had nothing for the next meal, the people were troubled. They were bothered to such an extent that they forgot the miracles God had performed, and they murmured and complained to Moses and Aaron. As we have pointed out, in their <span class="pg" data-page-id="402" id="402">[402]</span> murmuring they were very eloquent. But as they murmured and complained, they were exposed. Two things concerning them were exposed: that they were constituted of the Egyptian element, and that their appetite, hunger, thirst, and desire were still Egyptian. In their murmuring they expressed their desire for Egyptian food: “Would that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots, and when we did eat bread to the full” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33137" data-verses="Exodus 16:3">16:3</span>
, Heb.). This proves that their appetite was Egyptian. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf4r_LoqRmndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> Suppose God had rained down manna before the children of Israel arrived in the wilderness of Sin, and it was there waiting for them. In that case, the people would not have been exposed. They would simply have eaten the manna, and the problem of their Egyptian constitution and appetite would not have come to light. Therefore, in His wisdom, God did not send the heavenly supply of manna until the people were exposed through the lack of nourishment. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoaRMbWzqNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> Whenever we are undernourished, we are exposed. If we are always adequately nourished, many things will remain covered. But when we lack the proper nourishment, we are invariably exposed. When they are satisfied with good food, most people would not think of stealing. But if there is a severe shortage of food, many refined and cultured people will become thieves. They will be exposed by the lack of food. According to the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33138" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">Exodus 16</span>, God did not give His people anything to eat until after they had been exposed. It was necessary for their Egyptian hunger, appetite, desire, and constitution to be brought to light. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVOi3NEKXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> After the people had been exposed, God came in to satisfy their lust by sending quails in the evening. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33139" data-verses="Exodus 16:12">16:12</span>, the Lord said to Moses, “I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God” (Heb.). </p>

This is especially true if we are to see the spiritual significance of the various matters in the book of Exodus. In the foregoing messages we have seen that Exodus is a book of pictures. However, if we have no light and no vision as we read this book, we shall not be able to grasp the meaning of all these pictures. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBjuD71fFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> Many Christians know that during the years of wandering in the wilderness, the children of Israel ate manna. But not many of them know in a thorough and adequate way the significance of the manna in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33165" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">Exodus 16</span>. They may be familiar with the story in Exodus, and they may even know that manna is a type of Christ as food to us. But they do not have a full realization of the importance of eating as recorded in this chapter. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Bntjj74Mk5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> The concept of eating is a basic and underlying concept in the Bible. As we review the importance of eating in the Scriptures, we need to remember the principle of first mention. According to this principle, the first mention of a matter in the Bible governs its meaning throughout the Scriptures. After God created man, He gave him a command and a warning about eating: “Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33166" data-verses="Genesis 2:16-17">Gen. 2:16-17</span>). Eating is a basic concept in the divine Word because it concerns man’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="414" id="414">[414]</span> relationship to God. Therefore, after describing the creation of man, the Bible speaks of man’s living, which is related to eating. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GnZl6W_5KauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33167" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> we see that man was created in God’s image and after His likeness. The words “image” and “likeness” indicate that man is to be God’s expression. However, image and likeness are both somewhat outward. They do not necessarily involve inward content. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33168" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> shows the importance of man’s eating. This chapter reveals that God’s intention for man was that man would eat of the tree of life. Outwardly man possessed God’s image and likeness. But inwardly man needed to take the fruit of the tree of life into him as his content. The tree of life no doubt is a symbol of God as life to man. According to His eternal plan, God created man in His image and after His likeness so that man might express Him. Then God placed the man He had created in front of the tree of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33169" data-verses="Genesis 2:9">Gen. 2:9</span>) with the intention that man take God into him to be his very life. This is the first reference to eating in the Scriptures. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQa3RNs7iwajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> At the end of the Bible, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33170" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span>, we once again see the tree of life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33171" data-verses="Revelation 22:2">Verse 2</span> says that on either side of the river which flows from the throne of God and the Lamb there is the tree of life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33172" data-verses="Revelation 22:14">Verse 14</span> goes on to say that those who wash their robes have right to the tree of life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33173" data-verses="Revelation 22:19">Verse 19</span> refers to our share in the tree of life. These references in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33174" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span> all indicate that in eternity and for eternity God’s redeemed people will be eating of this tree. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33175" data-verses="Revelation 2:7">Revelation 2:7</span> says that those who overcome will eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m5FLoCMoyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> After man’s fall, God came in to redeem His people. The Passover is a complete picture of God’s redemption and of God’s intention and purpose in redemption. According to the picture in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33176" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span>, the concept of eating is basic and central in redemption also. At the time of the Passover, the blood of the lamb was put on the “two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses” wherein the lamb was eaten <span class="pg" data-page-id="415" id="415">[415]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33177" data-verses="Exodus 12:7">Exo. 12:7</span>). Then the people ate the flesh of the lamb with unleavened bread and bitter herbs (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33178" data-verses="Exodus 12:8">v. 8</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh_3fqmOovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> Furthermore, the main point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33179" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">Exodus 16</span> is the eating of manna. This chapter does not deal with behavior, conduct, or self-improvement; it deals with eating. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33180" data-verses="John 6:1">John 6</span> the Lord Jesus clearly said that He was the real manna, sent from heaven by God the Father to be food for God’s chosen people. Therefore, it is vital for us to learn how to eat Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33181" data-verses="John 6:32">verse 32</span> the Lord Jesus said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread out of heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.” Then the Lord went on to say that the one who eats Him will live because of Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33182" data-verses="John 6:57">v. 57</span>). Manna is also mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33183" data-verses="Revelation 2:17">Revelation 2:17</span>, where we are told that the Lord will “give of the hidden manna” to the one who overcomes. These verses help us to see that in the Bible the concept of eating is basic and central. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-2J80Ye189qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> We all realize that in order to live properly we need to eat properly. If we take in poison, for example, we shall surely die. I once read an article which said that a person’s diet can affect his temper. According to this article, a child’s temper in particular is affected by his diet. This illustrates the importance of the proper spiritual eating. Surely if we partake of Christ as the real manna, we shall find it difficult to lose our temper. As we have pointed out in a foregoing message, this heavenly food causes our lusts to be restricted. It also deals with our selfish ambition. On the one hand, the heavenly manna nourishes us and heals us; on the other hand, it eliminates the negative things in us. Because eating is such a crucial matter, the regulating of man’s diet is another basic concept in the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB5IICfIi6RI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> Do you know what brought about the fall of man? Man fell by eating improperly. In the same principle, we are saved and healed by eating in a proper way. Man fell by eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, but he is saved and recovered by eating of the tree of life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="416" id="416">[416]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZWzz8-FcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ">I. A TYPE OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-aPgcLxIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> Manna is a type of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33184" data-verses="John 6:31-35">John 6:31-35</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33185" data-verses="John 6:48-51">48-51</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33186" data-verses="John 6:57-58">57-58</span>). As the real manna, Christ was sent by God the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33187" data-verses="John 6:32">v. 32</span>) for God’s chosen people to live by Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33188" data-verses="John 6:57">v. 57</span>). Although we may readily acknowledge that manna is a type of Christ, we should not regard this in a natural way or superficial way. As we consider the account of the sending of manna in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33189" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">Exodus 16</span>, it is important for us to see the relationship between our eating and our living. We must eat in order to live. This is another basic principle in the Bible. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33190" data-verses="John 6:57">John 6:57</span> the Lord Jesus said, “He who eats Me shall also live because of Me.” Without eating, it is not possible for us to live. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cB1qPFTYxWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> Now we must go on to see that the way we live depends on what we eat. If you eat a great deal of fish, you will be constituted of the element of fish, for you will absorb the life and nature of fish. Certainly you will not be constituted of fish if your diet includes only chicken or beef, but no fish. The kind of life we have depends on the kind of food we eat. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTh4-AE4AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> According to the picture in the book of Exodus, the children of Israel were destined to have a heavenly living. However, when they came out of Egypt, they brought Egyptian food with them. During the first few weeks of their travels, they ate this Egyptian food. But when the supply of Egyptian food was exhausted, the people were troubled and began to murmur and complain. Although the shortage of food was a problem to the people, it was a cause of joy to God, for it gave Him an excellent opportunity to change the living of His people. God’s intention was to change their living from an Egyptian living to a heavenly living. God did not want merely to adjust, change, or regulate the people outwardly. He wanted to change them organically by changing their diet. When the children of Israel were in Egypt, they had many different things to eat, all elements of the Egyptian diet. However, God wanted to change their diet from many items to just one item, and that item was the manna which came from heaven. <span class="pg" data-page-id="417" id="417">[417]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33214" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">Exodus 16</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33215" data-verses="Numbers 11:1">Numbers 11</span> we are given a brief description of manna. In this short description at least fourteen aspects of manna are pointed out. Every aspect is one of the characteristics of manna. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGu9ZB2LvVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR">A. From Heaven</h2><p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPS83kj9JfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> The first characteristic of manna is that it came from heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33216" data-verses="Exodus 16:4">16:4a</span>). Hence, manna is heavenly. Although we do not know the essence or substance of manna, we know that it came from heaven. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33217" data-verses="Exodus 16:4">Exodus 16:4</span> the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you.” Manna is difficult to analyze. No doubt, it contained nourishment to meet all the requirements of man’s physical body. Otherwise, it could not have sustained God’s people those many years in the wilderness. On the one hand, manna has all the elements needed to sustain man’s physical body; on the other hand, manna is a heavenly food. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnC6heRjvPiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> Just as we cannot analyze or explain manna, we cannot analyze or explain the Lord Jesus Christ. Christ was sent from heaven by the Father to be the real manna. As the bread which came from heaven, He is the food by which God’s people live. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33218" data-verses="John 6:51">John 6:51</span> the Lord Jesus said, “I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats <span class="pg" data-page-id="428" id="428">[428]</span> of this bread, he shall live forever.” Who can analyze the essence of Christ as our heavenly food? It is impossible to analyze His substance scientifically. But although we cannot analyze Christ’s essence or fully explain it, He is nonetheless very real. He is invisible and intangible but He is substantial, and He sustains God’s people. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTN2hxVRdNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> From the time of the Roman Empire until today, many earthly governments and world leaders have tried to quench the Lord’s move on earth. They have also attempted to destroy and annihilate His Body. But all their efforts have been in vain. Christ’s Body could not be destroyed because within the church there is a heavenly essence, a heavenly element, which sustains the church in its sojourn on earth. Because Christ imparts this element into the church, nothing can destroy it or terminate it. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5aSJlOdEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> Just as manna sustained nearly two million people in the wilderness for forty years, so Christ as the real manna sustains the church today. This manna does not have its source on earth; it comes down from heaven where God is. Thus, manna is not only heavenly food, but also godly food. On the one hand, the Lord Jesus is “the bread out of heaven”; on the other hand, He is “the bread of God,” the One who came down out of heaven to be our food (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33219" data-verses="John 6:32-33">John 6:32-33</span>). </p>

With the Dew</h2><p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr86_5Sbe4ocJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33220" data-verses="Exodus 16:13-14">Exodus 16:13 and 14</span> we see that manna came with the dew: “In the morning the dew lay round about the camp. And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing” (Heb.). This small, round thing was manna. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33221" data-verses="Numbers 11:9">Numbers 11:9</span> also tells us that manna came with the dew: “And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.” It is significant that in sending the quails God used the wind. But in sending the manna, God used dew. Certainly God could have sent the manna without the dew. The fact that manna came with the dew must have a definite spiritual significance. Because my experience of this is not yet complete, I cannot <span class="pg" data-page-id="429" id="429">[429]</span> explain fully why manna came with the dew. But according to spiritual experience, I can point out that the dew signifies daily grace, the grace we receive each day. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33222" data-verses="Psalms 133:3">Psalm 133:3</span> we read of “the dew of Hermon...the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion.” The dew of Hermon signifies grace which descends from the heavens. Hermon, a high mountain, signifies the heavens, the highest place, from which the dew descends. The dew signifies the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjgb8NXOmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> Dew is different from rain, snow, or frost. It is softer than rain and not as cold as frost. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33223" data-verses="Lamentations 3:22-23">Lamentations 3:22 and 23</span>, God’s mercy, like the dew, is fresh every morning. Mercy in the Old Testament eventually issues in the grace of the New Testament. For this reason, Jeremiah used the word mercy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33224" data-verses="Lamentations 3:1">Lamentations 3</span>. Every morning the Lord’s grace is as fresh as the dew. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD5qzasYW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> We have pointed out a number of times that grace is God reaching us. When God reaches us in a positive manner, full of mercy and compassion, He becomes grace to us. Manna always comes by means of this grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzINJNDQ8CdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> We encourage the saints to practice morning watch at the beginning of each day. However, although we may regularly have morning watch, often during our time with the Lord in the morning we do not experience the freshness of dew. Consequently, we do not gather any manna. Instead, the Word seems merely to be letters in black and white. But whenever we experience the dew in the morning watch, we know that God reaches us and visits us. This visitation of God is the Lord as our grace. Our experience testifies that where the dew is, there manna is also. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqa-B6EdD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> When we have dew as we read the Word in the morning, the Word truly is food to us. If we do not have the refreshing dew, we cannot have the manna that comes with the dew. </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36TAVLLPBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> This picture of the manna and the dew is very precious. Truly a picture is better than a thousand words! The dew in the morning is refreshing. Without this dew, this grace, we are very dry. But with the dew we are watered and refreshed. <span class="pg" data-page-id="430" id="430">[430]</span> Thank the Lord that manna comes not by itself, but with the dew. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0Kyh29JYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ">C. In the Morning</h2><p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneHJM97IVnXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> We have pointed out that the quails came in the evening, but the manna was sent in the morning. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33225" data-verses="Exodus 16:21">Exodus 16:21</span> says that the children of Israel “gathered it every morning.” The fact that manna came in the morning indicates that it gives us a new beginning. Because the earth revolves on its axis daily, every day we have a new beginning, a new turn. We also have new beginnings monthly and yearly. Manna is not related to the yearly or monthly beginnings, but to a daily new beginning. If God sent the manna yearly, we could not survive. If manna were sent monthly, we would not be strengthened, sustained, and satisfied. Thank the Lord that He sends the manna daily. Every morning we can have a new beginning. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2RRxwwBIUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> In our spiritual experience we need these daily turns, these daily new beginnings. Sometimes at the end of the day I am eagerly awaiting the next morning and a new beginning. As I go to bed at night, I may say, “Lord, after resting tonight, I expect to have a new beginning with You in the morning.” Praise the Lord for every new day, for every new beginning! Manna always brings us such a new start. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zEvxasyyXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> We may also say that every new beginning brings us fresh manna. If you expect to receive manna from the Lord, you need to pray, “Lord, I am ready for a new turn. I don’t want to live the same way as in the past. I want to have a new beginning with You.” As you come to the Lord in the morning, are you willing to pray like this? If you tell Him that you are ready for a new start, you will experience the dew, and with the dew, the manna. However, if your desire is to relive the past, to live the same kind of life you did years ago, manna will not come to you. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgeCovRIPwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> In order to have manna, we must be prepared for a new beginning. From my experience I can assure you that manna comes whenever you are willing to have a new beginning. In <span class="pg" data-page-id="431" id="431">[431]</span> the morning let us come to the Lord and say, “Lord, I want a new beginning. I do not want to be the same as yesterday. I thank You, Lord, that in Your sovereignty and in Your economy, You offer us a new beginning every day of the year.” If you pray to the Lord in this way, eager for a new beginning, the manna will come in the morning with the dew. </p>

<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVOiHNAZne1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> In the previous message we pointed out that manna came from heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33233" data-verses="Exodus 16:4">16:4</span>), that it came with the dew (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33234" data-verses="Exodus 16:13-14">16:13b-14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33235" data-verses="Numbers 11:9">Num. 11:9</span>), and that it came in the morning (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33236" data-verses="Exodus 16:13">16:13b</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33237" data-verses="Exodus 16:21">21</span>). In this message we shall consider a number of other characteristics of manna. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJtyc--5Hiqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h">D. Small</h2><p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRA8L6ggxmTX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> Contrary to the human concept, manna was something small (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33238" data-verses="Exodus 16:14">16:14b</span>). People usually appreciate something that is great, and we often praise the Lord for His greatness. However, where can you find hymns of praise for the smallness of Christ? We have looked through many hymnals, but have not found any hymns on Christ’s smallness. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTN2hhVYPtP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> Building materials may be very large, but food must be small enough to fit into our mouth. The food taken in by us must be small enough to eat. If we want to eat a large piece of meat, we need to first cut it into small pieces. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5aSZlGP0fCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> Throughout the centuries, few of those who believe in the Lord have had an adequate appreciation of the preciousness of the Lord’s smallness. Many regard the four Gospels as the record of the life of a great person. Actually the Gospels do not emphasize Christ’s greatness. Yes, the Lord Jesus was a descendant of David, a descendant of a royal family. However, He was born in a manger, and He was raised in the home of a carpenter in a small, despised town. This indicates that the <span class="pg" data-page-id="436" id="436">[436]</span> Lord did not make a display of His greatness. On the contrary, He preferred to be small in the eyes of man. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8687qzFeZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33239" data-verses="John 6:1">John 6</span>, the crowd wanted to enthrone the Lord Jesus as a king, but He fled from such an exaltation of Himself. The next day He returned and presented Himself as the bread of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33240" data-verses="John 6:35">John 6:35</span>). He did not want to be a king; He wanted to be food that His people may receive Him as their life and life supply. Instead of being great, the Lord wanted to be small in order to be food for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIFO6IRj-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> From the time of Christ’s ascension until now, Christian teachers have tended to stress the greatness and exaltation of Christ. Nevertheless, Christ still wants to be small so that we may eat Him. The great revivals in the history of the church have not focused on Christ’s smallness. This is the reason that such revivals usually have not lasted very long. Furthermore, the corruption in Christianity has always come in through the door of greatness. If we would close this door, no element of corruption could enter into the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbAJOdgI7HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> In His smallness the Lord is altogether different from our natural concept of Him. Even we in the Lord’s recovery may desire to see great things. Because of the desire for greatness, many of those in the Pentecostal or charismatic movement are given to boastfulness and exaggeration. For this reason, we should discount a large percentage of the reports of healings and miracles that supposedly take place in today’s Pentecostalism. Some may boast that many healings took place in a particular meeting when there was not even one genuine healing. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0STzsJujsWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> Some years ago reports were circulated about a great revival that supposedly was taking place on the island of Timor. According to these reports, miracles were commonplace. Claims were even made that people had been raised from the dead. A former missionary who was there and is now in the Lord’s recovery attended some of these revival meetings to observe what was happening. In one meeting the leader announced that during the course of the meeting water would be changed into wine. At a certain point, this <span class="pg" data-page-id="437" id="437">[437]</span> brother saw the leader take out a bottle he had hidden and pour wine from it into a container of water. What falsehood! Falsehoods such as this are allowed to creep in because so many Christians have the desire for greatness. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYOBzIJBazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> Miracles are not food. Even a genuine miraculous healing may not be food to us. The Lord Jesus wants to be our food. It is possible to be healed by the Lord without receiving Him as food. Healings may be great and miraculous, but still not have the nature of food. However, it is possible to receive divine healing in the proper way so that through the healing the Lord becomes a supply of life to us. This kind of healing is not outwardly great; rather, it is small in appearance. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l8DEgAPMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> Those things in our Christian life which do not supply life to us either are not genuine or are not normal; they are contrary to the nature of food. According to the Gospel of John, people tried to exalt the Lord Jesus, but He always fled from such exaltation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33241" data-verses="John 2:1">John 2</span> the Jews saw miracles performed by the Lord Jesus. However, He would not commit Himself to them. He would not trust in those who were impressed by miracles. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33242" data-verses="John 3:1">John 3</span> Nicodemus came to the Lord Jesus by night. Without anything miraculous taking place, the Lord was life to this man in a very ordinary way, in a way that was calm, hidden, small, and silent. This is the divine way. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBjuj7yMFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> Even we in the Lord’s recovery may expect to see great things take place. Such a desire has often opened the door to trouble. The desire for greatness invariably results in suffering. However, this suffering may help to terminate the desire for greatness. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_BntDj9rck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> Because the Bible does not give us the dimensions of manna, we do not know how small manna was. Both in His greatness and in His smallness, Christ is immeasurable. The detailed description given of manna in the Scriptures simply includes a word about its smallness. Manna is small in order to be taken in as food. As the real manna, Christ is small enough for us to take in, digest, and assimilate. <span class="pg" data-page-id="438" id="438">[438]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GnZF6fvZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M">E. Fine</h2><p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQa3RtszyAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> Another characteristic of manna is its fineness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33243" data-verses="Exodus 16:14">16:14a</span>). Manna was very fine and even. By nature, we are coarse and unbalanced. Even in virtues such as kindness or humility, we may be rough and unbalanced. Rarely do we find a person who is fine, even, and balanced. However, when we take the Lord Jesus as our food, enjoying His word as our life supply, we are balanced. We become fine and even. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755Xy_jLg8djlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv">F. Round</h2><p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGsCTw5B-PzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33244" data-verses="Exodus 16:14">16:14</span> we see that manna was round. It is difficult to determine whether the manna was round like a flake or round like a ball. The roundness of a flake is circular, whereas the roundness of a ball is spherical. The Hebrew word seems to indicate that the manna was like a flake. But elsewhere we are told that manna was like coriander seed. This implies that manna was like a ball. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJluPKFLPAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> The roundness of manna signifies that Christ is eternal, without beginning or ending. Christ is eternal food with an eternal nature for eternal nourishment without limitation. Whoever eats Him will have eternal life with the eternal nature and will receive eternal nourishment. By eating Christ, we become eternal people, those who are beyond time. The eating of Jesus brings us out of time and into eternity. The life we received in regeneration is an eternal life with an eternal nature. Because we have received such a life, we have become eternal people. In a sense, we are eternal already, although, of course, we are still in time. The more we eat the Lord Jesus, the more eternal we become. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqH4gx-igEXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> The roundness of manna indicates that Christ is eternal, perfect, and full. With the manna there is no shortage. The Lord Jesus and His word are perfect and full. By eating Him we are transformed. The more we eat the Lord Jesus and His word, the more eternal, perfect, and full we become. In this diet of heavenly manna there is no defect or shortage. <span class="pg" data-page-id="439" id="439">[439]</span></p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2Ey84bBL6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb">G. White</h2><p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7TkIeYVZ-1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33245" data-verses="Exodus 16:31">Exodus 16:31</span> indicates that manna was white. It was clean and pure, without any kind of mixture. No earthly food is like this. Everything we feed on apart from Christ and His word is a mixture. Only Christ and His word are pure. The more we feast on Christ and eat His word, the more we are purified and saved from every kind of mixture. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9IlpJlKRnJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> If we come daily to the Lord Jesus and take Him into us and feed on His word, we shall undergo a process of purification that makes us more and more pure. Those who feed on Christ eventually become simple and pure. Most people are complicated. How can these complicated people be simplified? The only way to be simplified is to eat the Lord Jesus. The more we eat Him and receive His word, the more we are simplified. In this way we become single and pure. </p>

<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqa9h6AOT0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> In this message we come to a very deep matter concerning manna: the keeping of an omer of manna in a pot before the Lord for future generations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33269" data-verses="Exodus 16:31-36">16:31-36</span>). The commandment to lay up this portion of manna before the Lord was somewhat unusual. Nowhere else in the Bible do we read that God commanded His people to preserve an item of food before Him for coming generations. But after the children of Israel had begun to enjoy manna, God charged them to “take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before Jehovah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33270" data-verses="Exodus 16:33">16:33</span>, Heb.). Later we shall see that the manna was placed in a golden pot (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33271" data-verses="Hebrews 9:4">Heb. 9:4</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36TD1LMfhsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> What is the significance of the commandment to preserve an omer of manna, the heavenly food for God’s people? Why was the manna placed in a golden pot, and why was it put into the ark along with the tables of the covenant? The manna was in the pot, the pot was in the ark, and the ark was in the Holy of Holies. Furthermore, the Holy of Holies was in the tabernacle, and the tabernacle was surrounded by the fence of the outer court. Within the outer court was the tabernacle, within the tabernacle was the Holy of Holies, within the Holy of Holies was the ark, within the ark was the pot, and within the golden pot was an omer of manna. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0KxB27ZoJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> Apparently the ark was the focal point of the tabernacle. Actually, the manna preserved in the pot placed within the ark was the central point. The manna in the pot was hidden <span class="pg" data-page-id="448" id="448">[448]</span> under five layers of coverings. The actual focal point, therefore, was the manna in the golden pot. </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneHJPd7CHHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> We would do well to ask ourselves what is the focal point of our Christian life. Just as the manna in the golden pot was the focal point of God’s dwelling place, so Christ as the manna eaten by us should be the focal point of our being. The tabernacle was God’s dwelling place in the Old Testament, and we are God’s dwelling place today. From the standpoint of experience, we may consider ourselves as identical to the tabernacle, for the tabernacle was God’s building, and we are also His building. The church is God’s tabernacle today. We are corporately identical to the tabernacle because we are part of the church. As part of the church, the focal point of our being should be manna. To describe this manna in a fuller way, we may say that this manna is the Christ we have eaten, digested, and assimilated. Hence, the focal point of God’s building today is the Christ eaten, digested, and assimilated by His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2RSRw7T4UeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> Now we can understand why God commanded that a certain amount of manna be kept in a golden pot before Him. This indicates that the Christ whom we have eaten, digested, and assimilated is our center. What is the center of your being today? To say that our center is manna would be to use an Old Testament term. In New Testament terminology, we should answer that the center of our being is the very Christ we have eaten, digested, and assimilated. I can boldly testify that the focal point of my being is such a Christ. </p>

A MEMORIAL BEFORE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0KxB29LYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> The manna that was kept in the pot was preserved to be a memorial before God for the coming generations. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33272" data-verses="Exodus 16:32">Exodus 16:32</span> says, “Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.” As we consider this record from the standpoint of our experience, we see that as we partake of Christ day by <span class="pg" data-page-id="449" id="449">[449]</span> day, we are also preserving Him. Many Christians, however, are not preserving very much of Christ. We all need to preserve Christ. Before I came into the church life, I did not preserve much of Christ. But by the Lord’s mercy I can testify that during the past thirty years I have preserved a great deal of Christ. In this matter, I am very happy for the young people. Even the young ones among us are blessed in preserving a good amount of Christ. The amount of Christ we preserve depends on the amount of Christ we eat. The more we eat Christ, the more we preserve Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneHJPd7LVHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> In the Old Testament manna was preserved in proportion to the gathering and the eating. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33273" data-verses="Exodus 16:33">16:33</span> Moses told Aaron to put an omer full of manna in the pot. In the collecting and eating of manna, some of the children of Israel may have been greedy, whereas others may have been lazy. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33274" data-verses="Exodus 16:16">16:16</span> the people gathered “an omer for every man.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33275" data-verses="Exodus 16:17">verse 17</span> we are told that the children of Israel “gathered, some more, some less.” However, after they had measured the manna which had been gathered, “he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33276" data-verses="Exodus 16:18">v. 18</span>). Those who were greedy in their gathering of manna received one omer, and those who were lazy also received one omer. According to our measurement, the manna we gather may measure much more than an omer. But according to God’s measurement, its measure is exactly one omer. In spiritual things we should not be greedy. No matter how capable we are in collecting manna, eventually we all receive one omer. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2RSRwzBoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> We have seen that the amount of manna collected each morning came to one omer for each person. The amount of manna that was eaten each day also was one omer for each person. No matter how great a person’s appetite or capacity was, he ate one omer of manna. On the other hand, a person whose appetite and capacity were small also ate an omer. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zEsRavzSXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> The fact that an omer of manna was kept in the pot indicates that the amount of manna to be preserved was the same as the amount collected and eaten. This indicates that <span class="pg" data-page-id="450" id="450">[450]</span> we cannot keep more of Christ than we gather and eat. Rather, we collect and eat a certain amount, and we preserve that same amount. Using Old Testament terms, what we collect and eat measures an omer, and what we preserve also measures an omer. No matter how much we collect, we still have one omer. Likewise, no matter how much we are able to eat, we still eat just one omer. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgeBIvSJvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> The children of Israel were not permitted to save up the manna for the next day. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33277" data-verses="Exodus 16:19">16:19</span> Moses told the people, “Let no man leave of it till the morning.” Nevertheless, “they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until morning, and it bred worms, and stank” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33278" data-verses="Exodus 16:20">v. 20</span>). It was necessary for the children of Israel to eat their allotment of manna each day. If they tried to keep it until the next morning, it would become rotten. This indicates that to save according to the natural concept is not biblical. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjIwC6ixws7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33279" data-verses="Matthew 6:34">Matthew 6:34</span> the Lord Jesus tells us not to be anxious about tomorrow. Let tomorrow be tomorrow. Do not worry about it. Those who worry about tomorrow will try to save as much as possible. Such saving is never for today, but always for tomorrow. However, we should not live a life of tomorrow. We have only today—we do not have tomorrow. No one can live tomorrow. Every morning we should simply gather manna. We should be neither greedy nor lazy, but collect manna according to God’s word. God tells us to gather manna in the morning, and we do so according to Him. Then after grinding, beating, or boiling the manna, we eat it. What a peace and rest to eat manna like this day by day! We have a restful and peaceful life without worries and problems. Every day we eat our daily portion of manna and live one day at a time. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wNwu23K_vl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> The point here is that God commanded the people to keep one omer of manna, the very amount they collected and ate each day. This indicates that the amount of Christ we eat is the amount we can preserve. God does not command us to preserve any other kind of food before Him. But He does <span class="pg" data-page-id="451" id="451">[451]</span> require us to preserve an amount of Christ which equals the amount we have eaten of Him. </p>

In a Golden Pot</h2><p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_bWzV27ANcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33287" data-verses="Exodus 16:33">16:33</span> we see that an omer full of manna was placed in a pot and laid up before the Lord to be kept for future generations. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33288" data-verses="Hebrews 9:4">Hebrews 9:4</span> speaks of “the golden pot that had the manna.” Thus, the hidden manna was in a golden pot. The manna concealed in the golden pot signifies that our life is hidden with Christ in God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33289" data-verses="Colossians 3:3">Colossians 3:3</span> Paul tells us that our “life has been hidden with Christ in God.” The Christ hidden in God is the manna hidden in the golden pot. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vVsR9rnXqd_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> In the Bible gold signifies the divine nature. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33290" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span>, we are partakers of this divine nature. Only the nature of God, the divine nature, can preserve Christ as our hidden manna. Praise the Lord that within us we have a golden pot; that is, we have the divine nature. We cannot preserve Christ in our mind or emotion. We can preserve Him only in the divine nature which we have within us through regeneration. Actually, the divine nature within us is God Himself. The manna in the golden pot indicates that the very Christ whom we enjoy as our life supply is preserved in the divine nature which is now in our inmost being. Christ is our special portion of food hidden in the divine nature. When we touch the divine nature, the golden pot, we enjoy Christ as the manna hidden within it. <span class="pg" data-page-id="456" id="456">[456]</span> </p>

Most of us realize that the ark typifies Christ. Christ as the manna is preserved in the divine nature, and the divine nature is in Christ typified by the ark. This Christ is in our spirit, which in our experience is the Holy of Holies. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_Gnal6ftZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> Once again we see that this is difficult to understand doctrinally. However, if we apply this picture of the manna, the golden pot, and the ark to our spiritual experience, we shall be able to understand it. We all can testify that we surely have enjoyed Christ. We have also seen that the Christ whom we enjoy becomes the Christ we preserve. We enjoy one omer of manna, and we also preserve one omer. The Christ we enjoy is preserved in the divine nature that is within us. This divine nature is altogether in Christ, the reality of the ark. Moreover, Christ is in our spirit. As we remain in the spirit, we contact Christ. In the Christ we contact is the divine nature which preserves the Christ we enjoy as the hidden manna. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQa3SNszwAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> Our spirit is for the church, in the church, and with the church. The church is composed not with our body or soul, but with our spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33292" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">Ephesians 2:22</span> tells us that God’s dwelling place is in our spirit. We may even say that our spirit mingled with the divine Spirit is the church. When we enjoy Christ, we preserve Him in the divine nature which is in Christ who is in turn in our spirit. Since our spirit is for the church, with the church, and in the church, in experience we are actually God’s tabernacle today. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755Xy8DLj89jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv">D. Before the Testimony</h2><p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGsBzw6BePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33293" data-verses="Exodus 16:34">16:34</span> we read that Aaron laid up the pot with an omer of manna “before the Testimony, to be kept.” Some translators of the Bible consider that the testimony here refers to the ark. We strongly disagree with this interpretation. In the Old Testament the testimony does not refer to the ark; it <span class="pg" data-page-id="457" id="457">[457]</span> refers to the law of God, the Ten Commandments. The ark was called the ark of the testimony because the two tablets of the law were placed within the ark. Furthermore, the tabernacle was called the tabernacle of the testimony because it contained the testimony in the ark. Hence, the ark was the ark of the testimony, and the tabernacle was the tabernacle of the testimony. Within the ark in the tabernacle was God’s testimony, the law. If we say that the testimony in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33294" data-verses="Exodus 16:34">16:34</span>
refers to the ark, then the golden pot with the hidden manna must have been outside the ark, for this verse tells us that the pot was placed before the testimony. But by reading the Scriptures carefully, we shall see that the golden pot was within the ark along with “Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33295" data-verses="Hebrews 9:4">Heb. 9:4</span>). The golden pot must have been placed directly in front of the two tablets within the ark. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJltvKGKvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> This picture of the golden pot before the tables of the testimony indicates that the manna concealed in the pot corresponds to the Ten Commandments. This means that manna corresponds to God’s law. The manna contained in God’s nature corresponds to God’s testimony, which describes the nature of God and testifies concerning it. The law is a testimony of what God is. As we have pointed out a number of times, the law testifies that God is holy and righteous, and that He is light and love. These four attributes are the main aspects of the description of God’s nature afforded by the law. God’s nature is holy and righteous, and God Himself is light and love. The Ten Commandments describe these attributes and testify of them. The fact that the manna hidden in the golden pot was placed before the testimony indicates that manna corresponds to God’s testimony and meets its requirements. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqH4jR-hhkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> We need to apply this to our Christian experience. The revelation in the Bible indicates that as regenerated ones we have God’s testimony within us. We have the law of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33296" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Rom. 8:2</span>), and we have a conscience. In our experience we have learned that our efforts in the natural life to fulfill <span class="pg" data-page-id="458" id="458">[458]</span> God’s requirements always end in failure. There is nothing in the natural life which corresponds to God’s testimony. However, when we partake of manna as our life supply, the manna we eat becomes the hidden manna. This hidden manna, preserved in the divine nature within us, corresponds to the law of life and meets its requirements. In the words of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33297" data-verses="Romans 8:4">Romans 8:4</span>, the righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled in those who walk according to spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2Exc4YBr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> The tables of the covenant in the ark indicate that God’s testimony is in Christ. This testimony makes demands upon us and requires certain things of us. In ourselves we cannot fulfill these demands and requirements, for we have nothing in us which corresponds to God’s testimony. But when we take Christ into us as our food and as our life supply, the hidden Christ, Christ as the hidden manna, brings us into line with God’s testimony. In other words, the Christ preserved within us causes us to correspond to God’s testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7TkL-YWZe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> We have seen that according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33298" data-verses="Exodus 16:34">16:34</span> the pot with the manna was “laid up before the Testimony.” Many versions capitalize the word testimony. If the testimony denotes the ark, then the golden pot with the hidden manna was outside the ark. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33299" data-verses="Hebrews 9:4">Hebrews 9:4</span> says plainly that the golden pot with the manna was in the ark. Therefore, the testimony in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33300" data-verses="Exodus 16:34">16:34</span> must not refer to the ark, but to the tablets of the law which were in the ark. How significant this is when viewed in the light of our experience! The Christ we enjoy today is not outside of us, corresponding to God’s law. On the contrary, the Christ we enjoy is within us. Furthermore, this inward Christ corresponds to the law, which is also within us. We praise the Lord for the law of life within us. This law makes demands. But we have Christ as the inward, hidden manna to correspond to God’s testimony and to fulfill its demands. The Christ we eat and assimilate causes us to agree with the inner law of life. Therefore, we have three crucial items: the food, the testimony, and the correspondence of the food to the testimony. Hallelujah for the manna hidden in the divine nature, corresponding to the demands <span class="pg" data-page-id="459" id="459">[459]</span> of the inner law of life! Because of this marvelous correspondence, we can be free from all struggle, strife, and fighting within. We can be at peace. On the one hand, we have the law with its demands; on the other hand, we have Christ as our life supply which corresponds to the law. As a result, we can be at peace. </p>

This sequence is not accidental; it is according to the Lord’s sovereignty. The same sequence is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33316" data-verses="John 6:1-2">John 6 and 7</span>.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33320" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> we are not told that Moses was commanded to look for a rock or to bring a rock to the people. Rather, there is the clear indication that the rock was already there. Just as God had prepared the Red Sea to serve as a baptistry for the children of Israel, so He had prepared a rock, probably a very large one, to serve as a type of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33321" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">chapter seventeen</span>. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33322" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> the tree of life is mentioned before the river. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33323" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span>, the river of water of life is mentioned before the tree of life. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33324" data-verses="Revelation 22:1-2">Revelation 22:1 and 2</span>, the tree of life grows in the river. Why does Genesis speak first of the tree of life and then of the river, whereas in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33325" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span> the order is reversed? In the beginning stage the tree of life is followed by the river, but in the ongoing stage the tree of life grows in the flowing river. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4epq-JiqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> This is a picture of our spiritual experience. When we first heard the gospel, we received God’s word. To receive the word is to receive manna. After we received the word, the Spirit began to flow in us like a river. This was the sequence at the beginning of the experience of salvation. Now as we go on in spiritual experience, the Spirit as a flowing river brings us the supply of the word, the manna. At the beginning of our Christian experience we have first the word and then the Spirit, first the manna and then the living water. But as our experience of salvation continues, the order is changed, and the Spirit supplies us with the word. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33326" data-verses="Psalms 36:8">Psalm 36:8</span> says, “They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.” This verse refers to the initial stage of the experience of God’s salvation. Here the fatness of God’s house (the word) precedes the drinking of the river of God’s pleasures (the Spirit). </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj9A53HIH4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> It is significant that the children of Israel had the experience of living water recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33327" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> after they had begun to eat manna. Immediately after they began to partake of manna, they were led to a place where there was no supply of water. Far from being accidental, this sequence of events took place according to God’s sovereign arrangement. This sequence is part of the accurate and complete picture of God’s full salvation presented in Exodus. As we <span class="pg" data-page-id="469" id="469">[469]</span> have pointed out again and again, Exodus is a book of pictures portraying God’s salvation. As we consider these pictures, we need to worship God for His sovereignty. In His creation He made the necessary preparations. Then, at the proper time, He led His people into the place where the rock was waiting for them. </p>

They did not travel according to their own opinion or choice. The commandment of the Lord was no doubt related to the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire, by which the people were led in their journeys. The pillar signifies the Lord Himself, who took the lead and guided the people on their way. There was no need for God to tell the people when to move or where to go. They simply had to follow the pillar. Day and night, a tall pillar stood between heaven and earth. By day the pillar had the appearance of a cloud; by night it had the appearance of fire. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33329" data-verses="Exodus 13:22">13:22</span> we are told that the Lord “took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33330" data-verses="Numbers 9:17-18">Numbers 9:17 and 18</span>, “when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents. At the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of Jehovah they pitched” (Heb.). This indicates that the commandment of the Lord is related to the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire. Whenever the pillar moved, either by day or by night, the children of Israel journeyed. Thus, through the pillar God silently commanded the people concerning their travels. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4foY407VCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> In leaving the place where they first ate manna, the children of Israel simply followed the Lord’s leading. They did not move according to their preference, and they did not know where they were going. They just followed the pillar as it led them to a dry place, a place where there was <span class="pg" data-page-id="470" id="470">[470]</span> no supply of water, but where there was a huge rock. Here in this place God’s people were to experience His salvation. </p>

Furthermore, they experienced the Passover and the exodus, through which they were delivered from Pharaoh’s tyranny. Having made their exodus from Egypt, they crossed the Red Sea. In the words of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33331" data-verses="Exodus 14:22">14:22</span>, “the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.” Then, at Marah, God’s people experienced the changing of the bitter water into sweet water. Passing on from Marah to Elim, they experienced the seventy palm trees growing and the twelve springs of water flowing. After this, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33332" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>, they partook of manna as the Lord’s provision. In a short period of time, the children of Israel had seven outstanding experiences: the plagues in Egypt, the Passover, the exodus, the crossing of the Red Sea, the changing of bitter water into sweet, the seventy palm trees and the twelve springs, and the heavenly manna. If we consider our spiritual history, we shall realize that we also have had these basic experiences. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3n3iJ92EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA">OUR NEED FOR LIVING WATER</h2><p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9rBOvN1w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> After the seventh experience, the experience of the heavenly manna, the pillar led the children of Israel into a place where they would have still another experience—the experience of the living water. This indicates that even after we have experienced Christ as our manna, we still need to experience Him as our living water. In both spiritual life and physical life we need to drink as well as eat. We cannot live without drinking. Thirst is even more serious than hunger, for a person will die of thirst sooner than of hunger. As we <span class="pg" data-page-id="471" id="471">[471]</span> eat our food, we need something to drink. We also need to drink at other times during the day. Although we need to eat and to drink, drinking is more necessary than eating. Hence, in a sense, the living water flowing from the smitten rock is more crucial than manna. </p>

They had seen God’s miraculous acts, but they did not know God’s ways (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33360" data-verses="Psalms 103:7">Psa. 103:7</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0SUyMJox8Wf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> Suppose that you had been among the children of Israel at that time. You would have seen God’s miraculous power exercised in sending the plagues on the Egyptians. Furthermore, you would have experienced the Passover and a marvelous exodus from Egypt. Then you would have passed through the Red Sea as if you were walking on dry land. Following that, you would have tasted water which had been changed from bitter into sweet, and you would have enjoyed the twelve springs and the seventy palms at Elim. Just recently, you would have begun to partake of the heavenly manna miraculously provided by God. Now by following the leading of the pillar, you come to a place in the wilderness where there is no water. If this were your situation, what would you do? Would you complain and contend with Moses? When we come into such circumstances, we may think that we would thank the Lord. However, if we could actually do this, we would be the most spiritual of saints. If we were in such a situation, we would surely complain to the Lord. We would probably forget everything, including prayer, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="476" id="476">[476]</span> complain about our situation. Like the children of Israel, we might say to the leading ones, “Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33361" data-verses="Exodus 17:3">17:3</span>
). I do not believe that any of us would praise the Lord or offer thanks to Him. Instead, we would blame the leading ones and find fault with them. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYJATIAS6zJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33362" data-verses="Exodus 17:2">17:2</span> we are told that “the people quarreled with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink.” While the children of Israel were quarreling with Moses and tempting the Lord, in their midst was the pillar, standing between earth and heaven. But in the very presence of this pillar, the people complained to Moses. Reacting to the people, Moses said, “Why quarrel with me? wherefore do ye tempt Jehovah?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33363" data-verses="Exodus 17:2">v. 2</span>, Heb.). The people seemed to forget that the pillar was with them. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l7CkgIc8l6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> We may consider ourselves superior to the children of Israel and think that in such a situation we would never quarrel, complain, or tempt the Lord. We need to realize that for the children of Israel the pillar was outside of them. But for us today, the pillar is within us. Often when we complain about why we have come into a certain environment or circumstance, we have the sense deep within that the Lord who indwells us has brought us into this situation. Many of us can testify that a number of times when we have been complaining, we have sensed the Lord’s presence within us. Sometimes we have had this kind of experience when we were complaining about the elders of the church or accusing them regarding something they had done. While we were criticizing the elders, we became conscious of the pillar within. Therefore, we should not think that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33364" data-verses="Exodus 17:1-6">17:1-6</span> describes only the children of Israel. This portion of the Word is also a picture of us today. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9IioplJQHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> If the children of Israel had known the ways of God, they would not have quarreled with Moses or tested the Lord. Rather, they would have realized that their deliverance from Egypt was not initiated or carried out by them. It was wholly God’s doing, carried out on His initiative. God sent Moses to <span class="pg" data-page-id="477" id="477">[477]</span> the people to tell them that He would do everything necessary to bring them out of Egypt and into the wilderness where they would serve the Lord. The people would then have remembered that in Egypt they had seen God’s mighty acts. This should have given them the assurance that God would meet all their needs. They would also have understood that they were not in the present situation by their own choice, but by the Lord’s leading. The Lord led them there, and He was present with them, as indicated by the pillar which stood between heaven and earth. Hence, there was no need to worry about the supply of water. God certainly would not allow them to die of thirst. He would provide the water they needed. Therefore, they could be at peace. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGp8pBwZfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> If the children of Israel had been that spiritual, they would not only have offered thanks to the Lord; they would have praised Him with singing and dancing. They could have declared with confidence, “Our God has brought us here. He has His plan, and He will provide us with whatever we need for our living.” Although this should have been the attitude of God’s people, their actual attitude was altogether different. It seems as if they forgot everything God had done for them. Moreover, they even ignored the Lord’s presence in the pillar. They quarreled with Moses and questioned whether or not the Lord was among them. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPV9HkqvJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> Lest we be tempted to laugh at the children of Israel or criticize them, we need to realize that our situation today is the same. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33365" data-verses="Exodus 17:1-6">17:1-6</span> we have a photograph of ourselves. In doctrine and in teaching we may be clear and knowledgeable. But when we are in the actual situation, we forget everything we know. It may even seem to us that there is no God, for we may question whether God is among us or not. At such a time, we may fail to realize that the Lord is within us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnC9guRr9fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ">MASSAH AND MERIBAH</h2><p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJA-i00PaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33366" data-verses="Exodus 17:7">17:7</span> we are told that the name of the place was called Massah and Meribah because of the quarreling of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="478" id="478">[478]</span> children of Israel and because they tempted the Lord. The original name of this place, perhaps the native name, was Rephidim. Massah means tried, tested, tempted, proved. Meribah means quarreling or strife. Massah was a place of testing. Three parties were involved in the test at Massah: Moses, the children of Israel, and God. Israel tested God, and God tested Moses on the one hand and the children of Israel on the other. Hence, at Massah all three parties were put to the test. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33367" data-verses="Psalms 81:7">Psalm 81:7</span> confirms the fact that God put Israel to the test at Massah and Meribah, for it says God proved the people “at the waters of Meribah.” The only one who passed the test at Massah was God. Moses and the children of Israel failed. Although Moses and the children of Israel failed this test, God did not condemn them. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-DwoxsMx6qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> God tested the people by purposely guiding them by the pillar to a dry place. After leading the people to a place without water, God was silent and did nothing for a period of time. If He had immediately provided living water, the people would not have been exposed. In order to expose the people, God deliberately refrained from acting to quench their thirst. This put them to the test. As we have pointed out, because they quarreled with Moses and tempted God, they failed God’s test. If they had known God’s ways, however, they would have passed the test at Massah. They would have said, “The Lord has brought us here with a purpose. He will never let us down. Rather, He will surely meet our need. Let us thank Him, sing praises to Him, and dance before Him.” </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNFc_4HDaKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> Moses also failed the test at Massah. At that time Moses was an old man, more than eighty years of age. Because he was an elderly person, we might expect him to be patient. But in this situation Moses was not patient. When the children of Israel quarreled with him, he reacted immediately by asking why they were quarreling with him and tempting the Lord. It seems as if Moses was saying, “There is no reason for you to quarrel with me. I haven’t done anything wrong. Don’t you realize that I was not the one who led you <span class="pg" data-page-id="479" id="479">[479]</span> to this place?” Moses’ reaction to the people’s quarreling indicates that in this situation he was defeated. Like the rest of the children of Israel, he did not pass the test. </p>

<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGrDDw-TOPzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> Concerning the water flowing from the smitten rock in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33407" data-verses="Exodus 17:6">17:6</span>, there are some matters which are spiritual and mysterious. In order to understand these matters, we need to see that every record in the Bible has a spiritual significance. We should not try to understand any portion of the biblical record simply according to the black and white letter. For example, the account of the sending of manna in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33408" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">Exodus 16</span> has certain spiritual aspects. By considering these aspects we find out that manna is very mysterious. No one can say what manna was. Manna was mysterious because it came from heaven. In the same principle, the water flowing from the cleft rock is also mysterious. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJivfKBZPAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> Because manna came from heaven, it is easy to realize that it was mysterious. However, we may not recognize the mysterious aspects of the water out of the smitten rock. Instead we may consider that this was something natural, something merely related to the earth. But how could so much water come out of one rock? Was the rock a fountain or a spring? How could it be the source of the water? Furthermore, is the water from the rock physical or spiritual? If we say that it is only physical because it issued from a literal rock, what shall we do with Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33409" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:4">1 Corinthians 10:4</span>, where he says that the people “all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them”? According to this verse, both the water and the rock were spiritual. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqH_hh-nyUXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> Anything that is spiritual is mysterious. Hence, the spiritual drink and the spiritual rock are both mysterious. For <span class="pg" data-page-id="488" id="488">[488]</span> something to be mysterious means that it cannot be fully explained, although it may be enjoyed and experienced. Both the manna and the living water from the smitten rock are spiritual and mysterious. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2Dzs4RSr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> What basis did Paul have for saying that the rock was spiritual? Perhaps his basis was the abundance of revelation he received from the Lord concerning things in heaven, on earth, and under the earth. Having been instructed by Gamaliel, Paul had a thorough knowledge of the Old Testament. No doubt, through the revelation of the Lord given to him, Paul’s eyes were opened to see the spiritual significance of a great many items in the Old Testament. This may have given him the assurance to say that the manna, the water, and the rock were all spiritual. But whatever Paul’s basis was, we have the confidence that his interpretation was accurate. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7TjJOYeKO1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> The water is mysterious in that it flowed out of a rock which followed the people in their journey through the wilderness. Surely such a rock could not have been physical or material. How could a literal, physical rock travel with the people? The fact that Paul says that the rock followed the people indicates that it was a living rock. Hence, this rock was spiritual and mysterious. As we consider the matter of the water of life in resurrection, we must be impressed with the spiritual and mysterious aspects of the water from the smitten rock. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9rBuvN3w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> The water which came out of the rock is the water of life in resurrection. Resurrection denotes something which has been put to death and which is alive again. It also denotes life which springs forth out of something that has passed through death. The living water in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33410" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">Exodus 17</span> came out of a rock. Why did God cause water to come out of a rock? Since He is almighty, there was no need for Him to use a rock. He could simply have opened the ground and caused living water to spring forth. In the Bible this rock speaks of God’s redemption and Christ’s incarnation. It also speaks of Christ’s humanity and of His death. The water which flowed out of the smitten rock sprang forth after <span class="pg" data-page-id="489" id="489">[489]</span> incarnation, human living, and death. It flowed only after these major steps of Christ had been accomplished. The Bible tells us clearly that the rock was Christ. How could Christ, who is God, become a rock? This implies incarnation and human living. In order to be the rock, Christ had to become incarnated and live among men for a period of time. Eventually, when He was on the cross, He was smitten by the authority of God’s law. Hence, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33411" data-verses="Exodus 17:6">17:6</span>
is a profound verse. It implies Christ’s incarnation, human living, and death. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC41WY-H7C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> It is easy to see that the smiting of the rock typifies the smiting of Christ in His crucifixion. Now we must go on to see that the water of life flows in resurrection. It could not flow until Christ had passed through incarnation, human living, and death. Today the water of life is still flowing in resurrection. We often sing about drinking the living water. But when we sing these songs or read verses such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33412" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">1 Corinthians 12:13</span>, I doubt that very many of us realize that the living water we are drinking is in resurrection. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33413" data-verses="John 4:10">John 4:10</span> the Lord Jesus told the Samaritan woman, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.” The living water to which the Lord refers is the water of life in resurrection. Before the Lord Jesus was smitten on the cross, this water was not available for us to drink. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTbNBQBDXVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33414" data-verses="John 7:38-39">John 7:38 and 39</span>, the rivers of living water are related to Christ’s resurrection. Here we see that the Spirit as the living water could be received only after the Lord Jesus had been glorified, that is, only after Christ had been crucified and had entered into resurrection. The glorification spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33415" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span> refers to Christ’s glorification in His resurrection. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33416" data-verses="Luke 24:26">Luke 24:26</span> indicates that in resurrection Christ entered into His glory. Thus, when He was resurrected, He was glorified. After Christ’s glorification in resurrection, the living water flows. The Spirit as the rivers of living water could be experienced by the believers only after Christ had passed through incarnation, human living, and death, and after He had entered into resurrection. <span class="pg" data-page-id="490" id="490">[490]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8ALO1K3xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, “one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33417" data-verses="John 19:34">John 19:34</span>). Many Christians pay attention only to the blood which flowed from the Lord’s pierced side, but not to the water. Notice that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33418" data-verses="John 19:34">John 19:34</span> the blood is mentioned first and then the water. This indicates that first we are redeemed and then we receive the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m5CKYCMpyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> Although we have pointed out that the water of life flows in resurrection, we have not yet given a definition of resurrection. Resurrection is difficult to define. To understand it properly, we need the revelation of the whole Bible. In fact, the focus of the Bible is resurrection. You may be surprised to hear that resurrection is actually God Himself. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33419" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span> the Lord Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life.” In this verse resurrection comes before life. According to our concept, however, we have first life and then resurrection. But in the divine sequence resurrection comes before life. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh42vqmPovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> That resurrection is God Himself is indicated by the fact that the One who said that He is resurrection was God incarnate. He was the Word who was God and who became flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33420" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33421" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33422" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span> this very One declared that He is resurrection. Tracing backward, we see that resurrection was Jesus, Jesus was the Word made flesh, and the Word was God. This indicates that resurrection is the very God. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-2O9EYe089qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> Some may wonder how God could be resurrection since resurrection involves death. Without death, there can be no resurrection. How could God die, or be involved in death, in order to be resurrected? To prove that He is resurrection, God had to enter into death. There was no other way to prove that He is resurrection. To enter into death, God had to become incarnate. He had to have a human body with a human life and nature. The very God who became incarnate and passed through human living and death also entered into resurrection. Anything which passes through death and comes forth living is in resurrection. As resurrection, God is <span class="pg" data-page-id="491" id="491">[491]</span> the One who became incarnated, experienced human living, and passed through death. Now in resurrection He is victorious, triumphant, and transcendent. </p>

<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-DwoxMM1paQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> In the Bible the basic principle concerning man’s relationship with God is that man needs to eat and drink of God. Because eating and drinking are so common in our daily life, they have not been given much consideration by the great teachers and scholars of the Bible. Nevertheless, in the Scriptures eating and drinking are basic and crucial. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNFc_YHEJKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE">EATING AND DRINKING IN<br/>GENESIS, REVELATION, AND THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf4s-7osD2ndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> After the record of the creation of man, there is mention of the tree of life and of a river which “went out of Eden to water the garden” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33456" data-verses="Genesis 2:9-10">Gen. 2:9-10</span>). The tree of life was for man’s eating, and the flowing river was for man’s drinking. Hence, at the beginning of the Bible, eating and drinking are presented with respect to the relationship between God and man. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoaWNrW65tP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> At the end of the Bible we also read of eating and drinking. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33457" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span> eating and drinking are emphasized strongly. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33458" data-verses="Revelation 21:6">Revelation 21:6</span>, the Lord will “give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33459" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">22:1</span> we see the “river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33460" data-verses="Revelation 22:2">verse 2</span> we are told that “on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life.” The river of water of life flows out of the throne, and the tree of life grows in the river. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33461" data-verses="Revelation 22:14">Revelation 22:14</span> there is a promise related to <span class="pg" data-page-id="500" id="500">[500]</span> eating, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33462" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">22:17</span>, a call related to drinking. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33463" data-verses="Revelation 22:14">Verse 14</span> says that those who wash their robes have the right to the tree of life, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33464" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">verse 17</span> says that whoever wills may take the water of life freely. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33465" data-verses="Revelation 22:14">verse 14</span> we have the promise of eating the tree of life, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33466" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">verse 17</span> we have the call to drink of the water of life. Therefore, we may say that the Bible concludes with a word about eating and drinking. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVJjHNMZne1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> In the Gospel of John, the Gospel that emphasizes the deity of Christ, there also are references to eating and drinking. According to this Gospel, God was incarnated so that we may eat and drink of Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33467" data-verses="John 6:1">Chapter six</span> covers the eating of Jesus as the heavenly manna, as the true bread, the living bread, the bread of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33468" data-verses="John 6:57">verse 57</span> the Lord Jesus speaks a clear, strong, and definite word concerning eating: “He who eats Me shall also live because of Me.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33469" data-verses="John 7:1">Chapter seven</span> goes on to speak of drinking the living water. On the last day of the feast of tabernacles, the great day of the feast, the Lord Jesus stood up and cried, “If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33470" data-verses="John 7:37">v. 37</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33471" data-verses="John 3:1">Chapter three</span> of John covers regeneration, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33472" data-verses="John 4:1">chapter four</span>, the drinking of the living water. In this chapter a thirsty Samaritan woman comes to the well to draw water. At the well she meets the Lord Jesus, who talks with her and tells her that living water is to be found in Him. At a certain point He says to the woman, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33473" data-verses="John 4:10">v. 10</span>). Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33474" data-verses="John 4:14">verse 14</span> He says that the water He gives will become in the one who drinks it a “spring of water welling up into eternal life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33475" data-verses="John 4:14">v. 14</span>). These words about living water are weighty and of great significance. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoaWNrWzrNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky">THE WAY GOD WORKS HIMSELF INTO US</h2><p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVJjHNELXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> We should not consider the eating and drinking spoken of in the Bible as commonplace. On the contrary, these matters are crucial. It is by eating and drinking that we, God’s chosen people, take Him into us. Throughout the years, we have pointed out repeatedly that God’s intention is to work <span class="pg" data-page-id="501" id="501">[501]</span> Himself into us to be our life and our everything. But we still need to be impressed with the fact that the way God works Himself into us is through our eating and drinking of Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJt1d---Viqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h">HOW TO EAT AND DRINK THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRA7K6gmj2TX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> When I was in mainland China more than thirty years ago, I did not see the light on eating and drinking the Lord as clearly as I see it today. In the early years of my ministry, I did a lot of gospel preaching, often preaching on the subject of God as the living water to satisfy us. I even translated the song, “Never, Never Thirst Again,” from English into Chinese. I loved this song, was deeply impressed by it, and used it in my gospel preaching quite frequently. However, although I preached on God as the living water to quench man’s thirst, I myself did not know how to drink of this living water. How ridiculous for me to preach on drinking the living water when I myself actually did not understand how to drink! We Christians often do ridiculous things such as this. Most believers know that Christ is the heavenly manna; however, not many know how to eat Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTNxghVRcNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> The first message I delivered on eating Jesus was in 1958. Before that time I did not know the way to eat and drink Him. But having been enlightened by the Lord concerning this matter, I began in 1958 to speak on our need to eat Jesus. After I gave the first message on this subject, a brother who was a professor at Taiwan University approached me and told me that it sounded crude to talk about eating Jesus. (The Chinese word I used means to eat up, to devour.) I reminded this brother that I was not the first to speak of eating the Lord. I pointed him to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33476" data-verses="John 6:57">John 6:57</span>, where the Lord Jesus says that the one who eats Him will live by Him. I told him that I was simply following the Lord and repeating His words. When the brother heard this, he had nothing further to say. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5dTZlOcEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> Throughout the centuries, Christians have talked about eating and drinking, but hardly anyone has known how to eat or how to drink. Christians have written many “how-to” books, books on subjects such as how to pray, how to <span class="pg" data-page-id="502" id="502">[502]</span> overcome sin, and how to be victorious. But do you know of a book which tells us how to eat Jesus or how to drink the living water? But as we have pointed out, eating and drinking of Jesus are extremely crucial matters. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FbQHXmSwPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE">FACTS, NOT PARABLES OR METAPHORS</h2><p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr86_-TLe4pcJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> When I was young, I was told that those portions of the Word which speak of eating and drinking the Lord are merely parables or metaphors. I was taught that we could not actually eat Jesus, that this is simply a figure of speech, a metaphor. But recently as I have been considering the eating and drinking of the Lord Jesus, I have been impressed by Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33477" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:4">1 Corinthians 10:4</span>. Here Paul does not say that the rock was a type of Christ or a symbol of Christ; he says clearly that the rock <em>was</em> Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33478" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:3-4">1 Corinthians 10:3 and 4</span> Paul speaks of the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, and the spiritual rock. Lacking Paul’s boldness, we may weaken the force of his declaration by saying that the rock typifies Christ. Formerly I did not have the boldness to say that the water flowing out of the rock was spiritual. To my understanding, that water was physical, not spiritual. Furthermore, I did not dare to say that the rock from which the water flowed was a spiritual rock. But Paul says boldly and plainly that it was a spiritual rock which followed the children of Israel in the wilderness. Then he goes on to say, not that the rock was a type of Christ, but that the rock was Christ Himself. If we were to say this without Paul’s word as a basis, we would surely be condemned as heretical. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjnasNXNmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> We should not regard the eating and drinking of Jesus as parables or metaphors. I wish to declare strongly that these are facts. Daily, even hourly, I eat and drink the Lord Jesus. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33479" data-verses="John 6:1">John 6</span> the Lord says that He came from heaven to be our food. This is not a parable or a metaphoric utterance; it is a divine fact. Christ is our food and our drink. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33480" data-verses="John 7:37-38">John 7:37-38</span> he goes on to say that whoever thirsts may come to Him and drink and that out of his inner being will flow rivers of living water. This is a heavenly fact. </p>

<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr86_-S7e86MJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> In this message we shall consider what is revealed in the Bible concerning the way to drink the water of life. I can testify that I have spent more than thirty years to find out how to drink the living water. In the foregoing message I pointed out that although I preached a great deal about drinking of the living water, I myself did not know how to drink. Eventually, I had to ask myself, “You preach so much about drinking, but do you know how to drink?” I had to admit that I did not have the way to drink. I came to realize the urgency of finding out the proper way to drink. What would I do if, after a message on drinking the living water, someone were to ask me how to drink? Suppose someone approached you and said, “I believe that Christ is the living water, and I am thirsty for Him. Please tell me how to drink of this living water.” How would you answer such a question? </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjnbcNQdGh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> Not all the divine secrets in the Bible are revealed in a clear and evident way. In His wisdom sometimes God reveals His secrets in a way that is rather hidden. These secrets are recorded in the Bible and revealed in it, but they are not altogether open. For example, the Bible commands us to believe, but it does not tell us how to believe. For years in preaching the gospel I have told people to believe in the Lord. Whenever someone has asked me how to believe, I have been troubled. What would you say if someone asked you how to believe in the Lord Jesus? Would you tell that person in a doctrinal way that faith comes by hearing? If you <span class="pg" data-page-id="508" id="508">[508]</span> simply tell him to believe, what will you do if you are asked how to believe? The best answer to this question is that we believe by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. To the unsaved we should not give complicated answers about how to believe. Do not try to explain that by believing we enter into an organic union with the Lord. Such explanations will only confuse them. Tell those who want to believe in the Lord to simply open their mouths and call, “O Lord Jesus.” The way to believe in the Lord is to call on His name. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD-qTaqLm2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> Just as the Bible does not tell us how to believe, so it does not tell us how to drink the water of life. The Scripture simply says that if we are thirsty we should come to the Lord and drink. If we go to the Lord and ask Him how to drink, He may say, “If you are thirsty and want to drink, just drink.” We learn to drink by drinking. Thus, the way to drink is somewhat like the way to believe in the Lord. The way to drink is not exactly the same as the way to believe, but it is close. As we consider how to drink, I would like to present in a simple yet practical way what I have learned through more than thirty years of study. This word is given to those who believe in the Lord, not to unbelievers. </p>

POSITIONED TO DRINK</h2><p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqd-h6MOT0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> As believers, we have been positioned to drink. This is the first aspect of the science of drinking. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33509" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">First Corinthians 12:13</span> says, “For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.” Through baptism we have been positioned to drink. As long as we have been baptized into the Lord, we have the position to drink of the living water. Before we were saved, we were far away from the living water. But now that we have been saved, we have been brought back to the water and positioned to drink of it. For example, there is a drinking fountain in our meeting hall. But in order to drink of this fountain, our mouth must be in the proper position. Likewise, to drink of the living water, we must first be positioned to drink. Baptism gives us <span class="pg" data-page-id="509" id="509">[509]</span> this position. Thank the Lord that we all are positioned to drink. </p>

To drink the water of life there is the need of thirst (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33510" data-verses="Exodus 17:3">Exo. 17:3a</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33511" data-verses="John 7:37">John 7:37</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33512" data-verses="Revelation 21:6">Rev. 21:6</span>). Millions of today’s Christians are not thirsty for the Lord. What a mercy it is to be thirsty! I can testify that day by day I am thirsty for living water. If I do not pray for a certain period of time, I become conscious of my thirst. It is a mercy that we are thirsty for the living water, especially when so many Christians have no thirst. Many of us can testify that during the day we are conscious of the thirst within us. This thirst causes us to pray and to contact the Lord. In a simple way, we may say, “Lord Jesus, I am thirsty for You, and I want to contact You.” If we sense that our thirst is not adequate, we may need to pray, “Lord, increase the thirst within me.” We all need such a thirst for the Lord. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33513" data-verses="John 7:37">John 7:37</span> the Lord Jesus invites the thirsty ones to come to Him and drink. In like manner, the Spirit and the bride send forth the call to come and drink of the living water (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33514" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">Rev. 22:17</span>). Even though we have been positioned to drink and are thirsty, we still need to come to the Lord again and again. We need to come to the Lord continually, even twenty-four hours a day. If we tell the Lord that we want to come to Him all day long, He surely will answer our prayer. Tell the Lord, “Lord, I don’t want to stop coming to You. I want to come to You twenty-four hours a day, even when I am asleep.” No matter what we are doing, we may come to the Lord by calling on Him. Whenever we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we come to Him. </p>

CALLING ON THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0SUzcJuisWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> Although we have been positioned to drink and we may be thirsty and although we may come to the Lord and ask of Him, we do not actually drink until we call on the name of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33516" data-verses="Acts 2:21">Acts 2:21</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33517" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">1 Corinthians 12</span> we find the secret of drinking. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33518" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">Verse 13</span> says that we all have been made to drink of one Spirit, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33519" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:3">verse 3</span> tells us that no one can say Lord Jesus except in the Holy Spirit. To drink the Spirit is to call “Lord Jesus.” Whenever we call on the name of the Lord in this way, we spontaneously drink the living water. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYJBDIJCazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33520" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">1 Corinthians 12</span> we see that the water is the Spirit, for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33521" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">verse 13</span> speaks of drinking of the one Spirit. The way to drink of the Spirit is to call on the name of the Lord. If we are thirsty and call “Lord Jesus,” we immediately drink of the Spirit. Our calling is our drinking. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33522" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>, when we call “Lord Jesus,” we are in the Spirit. I can testify that whenever I call on the Lord from deep within my spirit, I have the conviction and the consciousness that I am in the Spirit touching the Lord. </p>

<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgZCYvWafwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> In the Bible we see that the drinking of the water of life and the flowing of the water of life go together. The drinking is connected to the flowing, and the flowing is one with the drinking. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33536" data-verses="John 4:14">John 4:14</span> the Lord Jesus says, “But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.” Here we see that if we drink the water of life, this water will become a spring within us welling up into eternal life. This welling up is what we mean by the flowing of the water of life. We find the same principle in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33537" data-verses="John 7:37-38">John 7:37 and 38</span>, where the Lord Jesus said of the one who believes in Him and drinks of Him, “out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.” The drinking and the flowing are thus two aspects of one thing. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjI3Bqi2js7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E">DRINKING AND FLOWING</h2><p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wN3tm3Ms_l3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> Without the flowing of the water of life, our drinking is in vain. In fact, if we do not flow, we shall not be able to continue drinking. Drinking is nullified by the lack of flowing. The genuine drinking of the water of life depends on the flowing. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4eo6-AwKTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> Let us use a water hose as an illustration. On the one hand, the hose takes in water from the faucet; on the other hand, it flows out water. Both the inflow and the outflow are necessary. The receiving and the flowing take place simultaneously. If we do not drink, we cannot flow; and if we do not flow, we cannot continue to drink. <span class="pg" data-page-id="520" id="520">[520]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj9A4nHAVIFazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> It is a serious matter to have our drinking nullified by the lack of flowing. Of the many genuine believers in Christ who have drunk of the living water, not many experience the flowing of this water. Eventually, this causes their drinking to cease. If there is no outflow from within you, you cannot continue to take in the living water by drinking. Only the flowing can keep the inner current moving. It is not the drinking, the taking in, that keeps the current going; it is the outflow of water which does this. Many Christians either do not drink at all or find that their drinking avails nothing. The reason for this is that, even though they may drink, they do not flow. The lack of flowing causes the drinking to be of no avail. This is very serious. Therefore, in this message I am burdened to point out that concerning the experience of the living water the flowing of the water is even more important than the drinking of it. Yes, our experience of the living water begins with drinking. But if there is no flowing, there is no way for us to continue drinking. If the flowing does not follow our drinking, our drinking will stop. Our experience testifies that this is true. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjnbMNXPmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2">THE SERIOUSNESS OF LOSING OUR THIRST</h2><p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD-qDasZW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> Furthermore, the lack of flowing may cause our thirst to disappear. Before we first drank of the living water, there was a thirst within us. It is very good to have such a thirst, but it is dreadful to lose it. The proper gospel preaching is not mainly to minister the water of life to others; it is to stir up a sense of thirst within them. When people are thirsty, it is easy to convince them to drink. Good salesmen know how to arouse in people the aspiration and desire to buy the product they are selling. Without such an aspiration or desire, people will have no interest, even in the most precious items. This illustrates the fact that thirst is crucial. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzINONzQ8DdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> By the Lord’s mercy we have been made thirsty for Him through the preaching of the gospel. I can never forget how my thirst was aroused through hearing a certain gospel message more than fifty-five years ago. I was so thirsty that I could have drunk an ocean of water. One message created a <span class="pg" data-page-id="521" id="521">[521]</span> thirst within me that has lasted even until now. Although fifty-five years have passed since I heard that marvelous message, I still thirst for the water of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqd-x6EcD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> We need to be impressed how crucial it is to flow the water of life. If the flowing stops, our drinking will stop; and if our drinking stops, we shall lose our thirst. Then, before our thirst can be revived and recovered, we shall have to pass through a period of spiritual death. After passing through such a time of dryness, we shall be stirred up by the Lord in His sovereign mercy to repent and return to Him. Our thirst will revive, and we shall begin to drink once more. I am deeply concerned about the degree of our thirst. Many among us have had the experience of losing our thirst. If we wish to maintain our thirst, we need to keep flowing and to keep drinking. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36UAlLLMBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw">INFLOW AND OUTFLOW</h2><p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0NyR29KYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> Doctrinally speaking, in order to flow the water of life we must have our thirst quenched (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33538" data-verses="John 4:14">John 4:14</span>). This means that if we are not filled with the living water, there cannot be any overflow. The flowing comes from the overflow, and the overflow comes from having our thirst quenched. From the point of view of experience, however, we need not wait until our thirst is quenched in order to flow. </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneHOMN7LUHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> Since we have already begun to drink of the Lord to quench our thirst, we need to pay attention to the flowing. Many of us started drinking the water of life a long time ago. Our problem is related much more to flowing than to drinking. In preaching the gospel to unbelievers, I would emphasize the importance of drinking, but in ministering to believers I would emphasize the importance of flowing. As believers, we have already begun to drink of the living water. Our particular need is for the flowing of the water. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2WRBwzAoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> It is difficult to tell whether or not someone is drinking, but we can easily tell whether or not a person is flowing. Let us refer again to the illustration of the water hose. We cannot see the inflow of the water, but we can see the outflow. Likewise, I cannot see the flow of the living water into <span class="pg" data-page-id="522" id="522">[522]</span> you, but I can see the flow of it out of you. We may not know whether or not the water is flowing into us, but we surely know when it is flowing out of us. Such an outflow is evident to everyone. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zDvBavwSXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS">FLOWING BY SPEAKING</h2><p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgZCYvSKvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> Perhaps you are wondering what it means to flow the water of life in a practical way. The flowing can be compared to flushing out something with water. To flush out a pipe is to flood it with water for the purpose of cleansing; it is to wash it out by a sudden rush of water. As Christians, from our inner being there should be a flushing of the living water. In order to have this flushing out, this strong flowing, we need to call on the name of the Lord Jesus and pray. It is also helpful to sing to the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjI3BqiyxM7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> What is particularly helpful to bring about the inner flowing is speaking to the Lord, by the Lord, for the Lord, in the Lord, and with the Lord. The more we speak in this way, the more we shall flow. If there is no one to whom we may speak, we should speak to the things in our room. Speak to the desk, the door, the walls. Speak to anything and everything. If you have a pet in your house, speak to it. Speak to the dog, the cat, the birds, or the fish. Some may regard this practice as ridiculous, but I can testify of the difference it makes to speak. Christians should not be dumb, silent. On the contrary, we must be those bubbling and welling up with life. We all have something to which we can speak. We can speak to the windows, to the doors, and to bricks and stones. When we speak, something of the Lord Jesus flows out. By speaking we are like a water hose which has both the inflow and the outflow. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wN3tm3J-Pl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> The amount of inflow is in proportion to the amount of outflow. The quantity of water which flows out of us determines how much water can flow into us. In other words, how much we flow determines how much of the living water we can drink. </p>

<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3n2CJ5lUyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> It is important to see that the book of Exodus is a complete picture of God’s full salvation. This fact is confirmed by the picture presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33556" data-verses="Exodus 17:8-16">17:8-16</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33557" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> we have the manna from heaven as the life supply, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33558" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">chapter seventeen</span>, the living water flowing out of the cleft rock for the quenching of our thirst. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33559" data-verses="Exodus 17:8-16">17:8-16</span> we have the war against Amalek. To be sure, this sequence is not at all coincidental. On the contrary, it is according to God’s plan. According to the picture in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33560" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapters sixteen and seventeen</span>, after we have received the heavenly life supply and the living water from the cleft rock, we are ready to fight against Amalek. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9rAuvKlQ9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> The battle against Amalek was the first fight in which the children of Israel were engaged. When they were in Egypt, they did not fight. At the Red Sea there was war between God and Pharaoh, but the children of Israel themselves did not fight against Pharaoh’s army. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33561" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> we see the children of Israel engaged in a battle against Amalek. Many students of the Bible realize that this fight depicts the conflict between the flesh and the Spirit. This indicates that as we are going on with the Lord, the first fight is that between the flesh and the Spirit. The fact that the first fight in which the children of Israel were engaged was that against Amalek indicates that after we are saved and baptized, the first conflict we experience will be the warfare between the flesh and the Spirit who regenerated us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="530" id="530">[530]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC41XY-Bpy81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33562" data-verses="Exodus 14:1">chapters fourteen through seventeen</span> we have a portrait of the many experiences through which we pass after baptism. These experiences include the experiences at Marah and Elim, the eating of the heavenly manna to satisfy our hunger, and the drinking of the living water to quench our thirst. After these experiences, we are equipped and made ready to fight against the flesh. This is confirmed by our experience with the Lord. After we were saved and baptized, we had the experiences at Marah and at Elim. Then we ate the manna and drank the living water. Only then did we discover how much the flesh frustrates us from following the Lord. The flesh is the enemy which hinders us from going on with the Lord. In this matter, the flesh is a greater enemy than the world is. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTbNAQBKFVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O">I. THE SUPPORT FOR FIGHTING</h2><p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8AKO1Clhnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> If we are inwardly hungry and thirsty, we shall not be able to fight against the flesh. In order to fight, we must first have our hunger satisfied and our thirst quenched. We need manna, the heavenly food, and the water out of the rock, the living water. Only then shall we have the strength to fight. The manna and the living water supported the children of Israel in their fight against Amalek. Without this support, the children of Israel could not have engaged in this battle. It is the same in our spiritual experience. If we do not enjoy the heavenly manna daily and drink of the living water consistently, we shall be defeated by the flesh and subdued by it. Those Christians who do not partake of the manna and drink of the living water are already subdued by the flesh. Without the manna and the living water we are spontaneously one with the flesh and walk according to it. Only when we are supplied by Christ and with Christ and have our thirst quenched by the life-giving Spirit are we ready to fight against the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYJBjIJAazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33563" data-verses="Exodus 17:8">Exodus 17:8</span> says, “Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.” This verse indicates that Amalek took the initiative to fight against the children of Israel. Amalek attacked them because of envy. The Amalekites had heard <span class="pg" data-page-id="531" id="531">[531]</span> what had happened to the children of Israel, and they were jealous. Therefore, Amalek came out to fight against God’s people. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l7DUgAOMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> Whenever we are not satisfied with Christ and not supplied by the life-giving Spirit, we are subdued under the flesh. But whenever we rise up and enjoy Christ as our manna and drink of the life-giving Spirit as the living water, we are no longer subdued by the flesh. The activities of the flesh are, of course, instigated by Satan, who works through the flesh. The flesh cannot tolerate our enjoyment of Christ and our drinking of the living water. For this reason, the flesh rises up to fight against us and to attempt to subdue us. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBkuz7yNFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> Before we began to enjoy Christ as our food and the life-giving Spirit as our living water, we did not have any consciousness that the flesh was fighting against us. At that time we were absolutely subdued under the flesh. We lived in the flesh, acted by the flesh, and walked according to the flesh. Everything we did was in the flesh. Nevertheless, we did not have any realization that the flesh was so active and prevailing. We were helpless victims under the evil power of the serpent, Satan. The serpent could work in us and upon us, and we had no consciousness of it. But one day we began to partake of the heavenly food and to drink of the living water. Then we began to rise up from under Satan’s hand and refused to be victims any longer. It is at such a time that Satan instigates the flesh to fight against us. Many of us can testify of this. We can testify that after we began to enjoy Christ and to drink of the living water, the flesh rose up to fight against us. Praise the Lord that we have the heavenly manna and the living water to support us as we fight against the flesh! </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_BgtTj9qck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> Day by day we are supplied with manna, the heavenly Christ, as our portion. The Lord Jesus taught us to pray, “Give us this day our daily bread.” Each day we need to pray like this: “Lord, give us this day our daily portion of Christ.” I like to pray in this way. Often I say, “Lord, I thank You for another new day. I ask You to give me this day’s portion of <span class="pg" data-page-id="532" id="532">[532]</span> grace.” Every day we need a particular portion of grace, of Christ as our life supply. We also need the Spirit as the living water. We have both the heavenly Christ and the life-giving Spirit. The heavenly Christ is our manna to satisfy our hunger, and the Spirit is the living water to quench our thirst. Do you enjoy this manna and living water day by day? I can testify that today I have enjoyed my portion of Christ, and I have drunk a good deal of the living water. Therefore, I am not subdued by the flesh. My hunger has been satisfied, and my thirst has been quenched. Thus, I have something to share with the saints. Living water can flow out from my inner being to quench the thirst of others. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GgZV6fsZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> Even though we partake of Christ as the heavenly manna and drink of the Spirit as the living water, Amalek is at hand to fight against us. We need to be mindful of the fact that Amalek, the flesh, is always with us. Immediately after we enjoy the Lord in morning watch, something may happen, perhaps at the breakfast table, to provoke the flesh. The flesh is envious of our enjoyment of Christ. Hence, Satan stirs up the flesh to fight against us in order to frustrate us from following the Lord. </p>

In this section we have a full picture of God’s salvation, a picture that includes both the dealing with the world and the dealing with the flesh. God’s chosen people were in bondage in Egypt, which signifies the world. Then God came in to deal with the world, to accomplish redemption, and to deliver His people from the world. Afterward, they enjoyed the supply of the heavenly manna and the living water. Then, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33601" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">Exodus 17</span>, God dealt with Amalek, that is, with the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cB1tPlTfiWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> If we have a bird’s-eye view of the first seventeen chapters of Exodus, we shall see a picture of God’s salvation which begins with the dealing with the world and concludes with the dealing with the flesh. This picture enables us to realize that, as God’s chosen people, we once were under the tyranny of the world. But after we were redeemed, saved, and delivered, we began to enjoy the divine provision of manna and living water. One day, however, we had to face a very subjective enemy—the flesh. This enemy seeks to trouble us, to occupy us, and even to destroy us. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTm4eACrQmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> The next section of the book, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33602" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">chapters eighteen through forty</span>, is a long section related to the kingdom. This indicates that after we have been delivered out of the world, have enjoyed the divine provision, and have dealt with the flesh, we shall be in the kingdom. What good news this is! Perhaps you have never realized that these chapters are related to the kingdom. Your only realization may have been that these <span class="pg" data-page-id="542" id="542">[542]</span> chapters cover the building up of the tabernacle as God’s dwelling place. It is crucial to realize, however, that apart from the kingdom there is no possibility for God’s house to come into existence. Only when we defeat the enemy, overcome the world, and deal thoroughly with the flesh shall we be in the kingdom. In the kingdom it is possible for us to build up the tabernacle as God’s dwelling place. The principle is the same with the building of the temple. After David fought the battle against the enemies and gained the victory, Solomon enjoyed the kingdom. In this enjoyment the temple was built. In the second section of Exodus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33603" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">chapters eighteen through forty</span>, we see that God’s redeemed people were in the enjoyment of the kingdom. Having been delivered from the world and having dealt with the flesh, they were able to build the tabernacle as God’s dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8677qzMM5Y6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> According to the New Testament, the Devil, the world, and the flesh are called the enemies of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33604" data-verses="Matthew 13:25">Matt. 13:25</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33605" data-verses="Matthew 13:39">39</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33606" data-verses="Romans 8:7-8">Rom. 8:7-8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33607" data-verses="James 4:4">James 4:4</span>). In Exodus Satan is signified by Pharaoh, the world is signified by Egypt, and the flesh is signified by Amalek. After these three enemies have been dealt with, the kingdom of God comes in. </p>

AMALEK—THE FLESH<br/>FULL OF ENMITY AGAINST GOD</h2><p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zDvhavySXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> In the Old Testament no enemy is dealt with more thoroughly than Amalek, because Amalek is a type of the flesh, which is the last enemy against God’s kingdom. The flesh is what keeps the church from being built up adequately. As long as the flesh remains a problem, the kingdom cannot come. The kingdom comes in only after the flesh has been dealt with. For the sake of the church life, we need to deal with our flesh. If the flesh is not dealt with, there can be no kingdom of God. Then without the kingship of Christ, His headship, there is no way for the Body to be built up. This is the reason that, during the past nineteen hundred years, there has been very little building of the church. The confusions and divisions among Christians today are primarily due to the flesh, to Amalek. Among Christians Amalek is <span class="pg" data-page-id="543" id="543">[543]</span> prevailing. Because of this, we do not have the kingdom of God in a practical way. Without the kingdom, it is impossible to have the building. Among the vast majority of Christians, it is not possible even to speak about the building of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgZC4vSIvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> We thank the Lord that by His mercy and grace we in His recovery have learned something of the importance of dealing with the flesh. Although the flesh remains a problem, we dare not let our flesh be unrestrained. We simply do not have the boldness to stay in the flesh. However, many Christians are extremely bold to be in the flesh. How strong is Amalek today! Because Amalek prevails, there is no kingdom and no building. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjI3BKixxs7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> In his writings Paul thoroughly deals with the flesh. He uses certain expressions to show that the flesh is enmity against God. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33608" data-verses="Romans 8:7">Romans 8:7</span> he says that “the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be.” The flesh is ugly for the simple reason that it is not subject to the law of God. From God’s point of view, the flesh is lawless. Lawlessness prevails among many Christians today. The flesh is lawless in its inability to be subject to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wN3tG3K-vl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33609" data-verses="Romans 8:8">8:8</span> Paul goes on to say, “And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” The flesh is not subject to the law of God, it cannot be subject to the law of God, and it cannot please God. Therefore, in the eyes of God there is no place for the flesh. It must be terminated. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4eoa-JjqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> The flesh denotes the totality of the fallen old man. Hence, the flesh does not refer simply to part of our being but to our entire fallen being. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33610" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Romans 6:6</span>, the old man has been crucified with Christ. Because the old man is hopeless, God put it on the cross and crucified it with Christ. As we shall see, we need to cooperate with God in what He has done by crucifying the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33611" data-verses="Galatians 5:24">Gal. 5:24</span>). The destiny of the flesh is to be put to death. No matter how the flesh may appear to us, in God’s eyes it is rebellious and despicable. For this reason, God has decided to blot out the name of Amalek. <span class="pg" data-page-id="544" id="544">[544]</span> </p>

In many places in the Old Testament we see that God’s people fought against Amalek. We see this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33612" data-verses="Judges 3:13-15">Judges 3:13-15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33613" data-verses="Judges 5:14">5:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33614" data-verses="Judges 6:3">6:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33615" data-verses="Judges 7:12-14">7:12-14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33616" data-verses="1Samuel 15:2-9">1 Samuel 15:2-9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33617" data-verses="1Samuel 15:32-33">32-33</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33618" data-verses="1Samuel 27:8">27:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33619" data-verses="1Samuel 30:1-17">30:1-17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33620" data-verses="2Samuel 8:12">2 Samuel 8:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33621" data-verses="1Chronicles 4:42-43">1 Chronicles 4:42-43</span>. We see the war with Amalek even in the book of Esther (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33622" data-verses="Esther 3:1-6">3:1-6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33623" data-verses="Esther 9:7-10">9:7-10</span>), where we are told that Haman was an Agagite, a descendant of Agag, the king of Amalek who was cut in pieces by Samuel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33624" data-verses="1Samuel 15:33">1 Sam. 15:33</span>). Although Agag was slain, certain of his descendants survived. Haman was a late descendant of Agag. God hates the flesh signified by Haman. According to the book of Esther, the flesh works in a hidden way to undermine God’s people and even to kill them. Today Haman, the flesh, tries to work in the church. Haman’s plot to annihilate the children of Israel was eventually exposed and thwarted. Esther was exercised to deal with Haman, the hidden flesh. Through her help, Haman was put to death. Thus we see that the book of Esther is a story of God’s war with Amalek, the continuation of the warfare with Amalek from generation to generation. </p>

<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP635f6DP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> We come now to the important matter of how to fight against Amalek. In the first place, we fight by praying with the interceding Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33625" data-verses="Exodus 17:11">Exo. 17:11</span>). Moses lifting up his hand on the mountaintop typifies the interceding Christ in the heavens. We are told in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33626" data-verses="Exodus 17:12">17:12</span> that when Moses’ hands were heavy, “Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.” What is the significance of this? We have pointed out that Moses here is a type of Christ interceding for us in the heavens. But we cannot say that Christ’s hands are heavy, can we? Surely Christ does not need anyone to stay up His hands. There is no Aaron or Hur in the heavens helping Christ with His <span class="pg" data-page-id="545" id="545">[545]</span> intercession. It seems, then, that the type is not altogether fitting. However, since the Bible was inspired by God, there must be something here related to our spiritual experience. </p>

<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Bguzj54Mk5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> A basic principle in the Bible is that the spiritual things revealed in the New Testament are portrayed by the pictures, or types, in the Old Testament. This is true in the case of the flesh, typified by Amalek. In his writings, Paul dealt with the flesh in a thorough way. In the entire Bible there are no stronger words concerning the flesh than those used by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33652" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33653" data-verses="Romans 8:7">verse 7</span> Paul says that “the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God” and that it is “not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be.” In the following verse he goes on to say that “those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33654" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">Galatians 5</span> Paul also speaks strongly and emphatically about the flesh. However, if we had only <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33655" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33656" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">Galatians 5</span>, we would still find it difficult to have an adequate understanding of what the flesh is, because in the Bible the term “flesh” is used in several different ways with many different meanings. Thus, it is difficult to know the flesh and to deal with it. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_Gga16Y_5KauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M">I. ISHMAEL, THE ISSUE OF THE FLESH,<br/>VERSUS ISAAC, THE ISSUE OF GRACE</h2><p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQawSds1iwajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> We thank the Lord for the pictures of the flesh provided in the Old Testament. One such picture is that of Ishmael in the book of Genesis. After man had fallen again and again until, at Babel, he reached the lowest point, God came in to call out Abraham and promised to do certain things for him. In His contact with Abraham, God did not require Abraham to do anything other than to leave his father’s country. Students of the Bible realize that God’s contact with Abraham <span class="pg" data-page-id="554" id="554">[554]</span> was related to the promise He made to Abraham. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33657" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span> we have the promise, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33658" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">Genesis 15</span>, the promise ratified to become a covenant. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33659" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Genesis 17</span> circumcision became the sign, or seal, of the covenant ratified in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33660" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">Genesis 15</span>. God’s promise to Abraham was repeated to his son, Isaac, and to his grandson, Jacob. God had promised that He would do something for Abraham which would cause all the nations on earth to be blessed. What a great promise this was! </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755X18TLqu9jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> The nature of God’s promise to Abraham was grace. This means that God did not want Abraham to do anything to fulfill this promise. Instead, God wanted to do everything for him. Like Abraham, whatever we are and have is of the flesh. Furthermore, whatever we are capable of doing is according to the flesh. For us to do something to fulfill God’s promise means that we exercise our flesh in some way. This was the reason that God did not require Abraham to do anything to fulfill the promise. God wanted to do everything. This is grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGrBjwyTOPzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> However, Abraham acted upon Sarah’s proposal to produce a seed by Hagar. In doing this, Abraham exercised his flesh, and the result, the issue, produced was Ishmael. God wanted Abraham to be terminated. But, at the age of eighty-six, Abraham took Hagar and produced Ishmael by her. For the next thirteen years, God did not appear to him. Then, when Abraham was ninety-nine, God came to rebuke him and to reaffirm the promise He had made to him. At that time Abraham realized that he had been wrong. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJit_KGLvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> The result of the exercise of the flesh is Ishmael. Ishmael is versus Isaac, who is the result, the issue, of grace. Grace is God becoming everything to us. In particular, grace is God as our strength and enjoyment. God had promised Abraham that He would give him a son. But God did not want Abraham to produce the seed. Therefore, God waited until Abraham regarded himself as dead, totally without ability to beget a child. Then, when in the eyes of both Abraham and Sarah it was impossible for them to have a son, God came in to enable them to have a child. According to the record in <span class="pg" data-page-id="555" id="555">[555]</span> Genesis, the birth of Isaac was the coming of the Lord. When Isaac was born, God came. This, of course, does not mean that Isaac was the Son of God. It means that Isaac was born not through the exercise of man’s flesh, but according to God’s grace, according to God’s visitation. Isaac, therefore, is the issue of grace. Ishmael, the issue of man’s flesh, is versus Isaac. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqH_jB-hgkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> Isaac was a person produced out of God’s grace to fulfill God’s eternal purpose. This is a matter of great significance. Thus, it is a very serious thing to be versus Isaac. For Ishmael, the issue of the flesh, to be versus Isaac, the issue of God’s grace, is rebellion, a great rebellion against God’s eternal purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2DxM4YAr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> It is very difficult to define adequately what the flesh is. In this message I would like to set forth a particular definition of the flesh: the flesh denotes anything that does not work by grace. Grace is the Triune God becoming everything to us and doing everything for us. The New Testament reveals that grace does not refer to material blessings. According to the New Testament, grace is God Himself not only being our enjoyment, but also doing everything for us. Whatever we do is of the flesh, but whatever God does for us is grace. If I speak in myself without depending on God, my speaking is of the flesh, even if the subject is the Bible or spiritual doctrine. This indicates that even in speaking about spiritual things or scriptural things, we may be of the flesh. Whatever we do, good or evil, apart from grace is the flesh. For example, if a brother loves his wife by the self rather than by grace, his love is of the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7TjLuYWYe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> In a sense the so-called good flesh is more hateful to God than the evil flesh. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33661" data-verses="1Samuel 15:1">1 Samuel 15</span> we see that God hated the good aspects of Amalek. Therefore, whatever we do without depending on God and trusting in Him is of the flesh, no matter how good that thing may be. Anything that is not done by God is of the flesh. If I visit you in myself and not by God, that is of the flesh. If I pray for others without depending on God, but instead pray in the self, that prayer is of the flesh. Do not think that the flesh refers only to evil matters <span class="pg" data-page-id="556" id="556">[556]</span> or to lust. It is obvious that such things are of the flesh. The flesh also includes good things. Notice the words “best” and “choice” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33662" data-verses="1Samuel 15:1">1 Samuel 15</span>. Saul spared the best cattle and the choice spoil. Related to the flesh are things which are the “best” and which are “choice.” Therefore, we say once again that whatever we do without the Spirit, without depending on God and trusting Him, no matter how good it may seem, is of the flesh. Whatever has its source in ourselves is an Ishmael. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9Iiq5lJRHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> Isaac typifies Christ. Hence, the issue of the flesh, typified by Ishmael, is versus Christ. God’s intention is to work Christ into us. But the flesh works in a way that is versus Christ. The result, the issue, of the flesh is versus Isaac. Whenever we exercise our flesh, we produce an Ishmael, and this Ishmael is invariably versus Christ. Ishmael cuts us off from grace and keeps us from Christ. For this reason, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33663" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> the Lord Jesus said that apart from Him we can do nothing. However, we have done a great many things apart from Christ. But all the good we have done apart from Christ is an Ishmael who is versus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGp-5BwYfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> Ishmael keeps us from fulfilling God’s eternal purpose. We cannot fulfill God’s purpose as long as we exercise our flesh and do not trust in God, depend on Him, or live in oneness with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPV_XkquJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> We are accustomed to do so many things apart from Christ. We all condemn sinful things. But not many condemn good things, even those seemingly spiritual things, which are done apart from Christ. Have you ever condemned yourself because you prayed for a certain thing in the flesh? The issue of praying in the flesh will also be an Ishmael of some kind. This Ishmael is versus Christ and frustrates us from enjoying the grace of God for the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose. </p>

<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGp-pB0LvVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> Apparently <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33689" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">Exodus 18</span> is not a difficult chapter. However, it is actually the most difficult chapter in the book of Exodus to understand. To understand this chapter, we need to realize that, in principle, Exodus is a picture of God’s full salvation. Every case and story recorded in this book is part of this portrait. In this message we shall consider what part of God’s salvation is portrayed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33690" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">chapter eighteen</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPV_Hkt9JfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> Some readers of the Bible may wonder why <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33691" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">chapter eighteen</span> is included in the book of Exodus. They may think that it would be better to go directly from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33692" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33693" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapter nineteen</span>, from the defeat of the Amalekites to the mountain of God, where the people received the heavenly vision. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33694" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">Chapter eighteen</span> seems to stand alone, having no connection with either <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33695" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> or <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33696" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">nineteen</span>. However, if we care for the principle that Exodus is a picture book portraying God’s full salvation, we shall want to know the significance of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33697" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">Exodus 18</span> with respect to this portrait. What is the meaning, the significance, of this chapter in God’s salvation? </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnC9iuRtvPiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ">I. HISTORY</h2><p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJA8i09c6oTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> If we read carefully the books of Numbers and Deuteronomy, we shall find that what is recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33698" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">Exodus 18</span> was not written according to the sequence of history. The events in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33699" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">Exodus 18</span> did not take place immediately after the events recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33700" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">Exodus 17</span>. Actually, the events in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33701" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">chapter eighteen</span> took place after the building of the tabernacle and not long before the children of Israel began their journey with <span class="pg" data-page-id="568" id="568">[568]</span> the tabernacle toward the good land. Therefore, according to historical sequence, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33702" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">chapter eighteen</span>
should come after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33703" data-verses="Exodus 40:1">chapter forty</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33704" data-verses="Deuteronomy 1:6-18">Deuteronomy 1:6-18</span> proves this. The time to which Moses refers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33705" data-verses="Deuteronomy 1:9">Deuteronomy 1:9</span> was the time the children of Israel were about to begin their journey with the tabernacle to the good land. At that time, Moses told the people that he alone could not bear their weariness, burden, and strife (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33706" data-verses="Deuteronomy 1:12">Deut. 1:12</span>, Heb.). That was the time captains were appointed over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-DwozsM5paQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p">II. DOCTRINE</h2><p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4foao07UCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> Since these things took place after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33707" data-verses="Exodus 40:1">Exodus 40</span>, why are they recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33708" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">Exodus 18</span> and inserted between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33709" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">chapters seventeen</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33710" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">nineteen</span>? To answer this question we need to recognize another important principle: the Bible was written mainly to give us a complete revelation of God’s economy. For this reason, sometimes the biblical record is not according to the sequence of history, but is instead according to doctrine. The Gospel of Matthew, for example, was not written according to the sequence of history; rather, it was written according to a particular doctrinal arrangement. The Gospel of Mark, on the contrary, was written according to the sequence of historical events. Matthew arranged the events according to doctrinal significance. This principle applies to the placement of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33711" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">Exodus 18</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP60Zf6BP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> To be sure, the book of Exodus does not record everything that happened to the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt and spent the first period of time in the wilderness. The same principle applies in the four Gospels. The Gospels do not include everything the Lord Jesus did in His life on earth. The writers of the Gospels selected certain things and put them together for the purpose of presenting a view of the divine revelation. Exodus was written in the same principle and for the same purpose. The purpose of Exodus is not to give us a detailed history of everything that happened to the children of Israel; it was written to present a complete view of God’s full salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2lgzkmclAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33712" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">Exodus 17</span> Amalek is defeated. This signifies the <span class="pg" data-page-id="569" id="569">[569]</span> subduing of the flesh, which frustrates God’s people from going on with Him. After the defeat of Amalek, there is the need of something to portray the kingdom of God. Under divine inspiration, Moses inserted an event which occurred later in order to fill the gap between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33713" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">chapters seventeen</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33714" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">nineteen</span> and to show us that in God’s full salvation the kingdom comes after the defeat and subduing of the flesh. After the defeat of Amalek, the kingdom is needed for the building up of God’s dwelling on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3n1yJ93EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> We have pointed out again and again that Amalek signifies the flesh, God’s enemy within man. Satan is God’s enemy. Through the fall of man, Satan has brought forth another enemy of God. This enemy, man’s flesh, is God’s enemy within man. In the eyes of God, the two greatest enemies of God are Satan and the flesh. In a sense, Satan also is in fallen man. But the actual subjective enemy of God in man is the flesh. For this reason, God hates man’s flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9rDevN2w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> According to the New Testament, when man’s flesh is defeated and subdued, the kingdom of God immediately comes in. This point is clearly indicated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33715" data-verses="Galatians 5:17-25">Galatians 5:17-25</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33716" data-verses="Galatians 5:17">Galatians 5:17</span> says, “For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33717" data-verses="Galatians 5:21">Verse 21</span> tells us that those who practice the things of the flesh will not inherit the kingdom of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33718" data-verses="Galatians 5:24">Verse 24</span>, using the phrase, “have crucified the flesh,” refers to the cross. When the flesh is crossed out, the kingdom is present with us. This is confirmed by our experience. The Spirit is versus the flesh. In the Spirit there is the power to cross out the flesh. When the Spirit with the power of the cross defeats our flesh and causes it to be subdued, the kingdom of God is with us. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC41Uo-H6C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> Four crucial words in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33719" data-verses="Galatians 5:17-25">Galatians 5:17-25</span> are flesh, Spirit, crucified (referring to the cross), and kingdom. Each of these four terms may be signified by a color: the flesh by black, the Spirit by green, the cross by red, and the kingdom by blue. It may even be helpful to mark these words in our Bibles with these colors. The flesh certainly is black, whereas the Spirit is green, full of life. The red cross <span class="pg" data-page-id="570" id="570">[570]</span> deals with the black flesh. This brings in the kingdom, signified by blue, the color of the sky. If we focus our attention on these four terms, we shall be enlightened. In our experience today we have the black of the flesh, the green of the Spirit, the red of the cross, and the blue of the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTbNDgBDWVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> The book of Exodus is composed of two main sections. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33720" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">Chapters one through seventeen</span> make up the first section, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33721" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapters nineteen through forty</span>, the second section. In the first section we see that we, who were fallen, have been redeemed, saved, and delivered. Furthermore, we see that we have passed through the Red Sea and have entered into the wilderness, where we enjoy God’s provision and defeat the flesh. What a wonderful salvation this is! </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8AJ-1K2xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> In the second section, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33722" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapters nineteen through forty</span>, we have a revelation of the building up of God’s dwelling place on earth. Several chapters in this section are concerned with the law. However, this fact should not keep us from having a complete view of the book of Exodus. The purpose of this book is to show God’s full salvation for the building up of His dwelling place. In the first chapter we see God’s chosen people in a fallen condition in Egypt, but in the last chapter we see the tabernacle as God’s dwelling place. What a contrast! God’s chosen people are saved all the way from their fallen condition into God’s dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m5CIoCMqyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> At the beginning of the book of Exodus, the children of Israel, God’s chosen people, are under the tyranny of the world. God saved them, delivered them, rescued them, and made them His dwelling place on earth. Thus, the focal point of the book of Exodus is not the giving of the law. Yes, this book definitely records the decree of the law. But if we only pay attention to this, we shall not see that the complete view of the book of Exodus encompasses God’s salvation for the building of His dwelling place. In the first seventeen chapters of this book we have a portrait of how God saved His people, delivered them, rescued them, and provided for them in the wilderness. Then He brought them to Mount Sinai to give them the vision of the building of His dwelling place so that they might build it according to this vision. <span class="pg" data-page-id="571" id="571">[571]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRA6KKgixmTX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> If we read the book of Exodus in the spirit with much prayer and thereby enter into the spiritual significance of this book, we shall see that it portrays God’s salvation from the beginning to its consummation. Exodus is composed of two main sections, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33780" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">chapters one through eighteen</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33781" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapters nineteen through forty</span>. In the first section we see God’s salvation, God’s provision, the victory over the flesh, and, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33782" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">chapter eighteen</span>, a portrait of the kingdom of God. After God’s chosen and called people had been brought into the kingdom, they were ready to accomplish God’s purpose to build His dwelling place on earth. In this message we come to the second section of Exodus, which is concerned with God’s dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTNwgRVWPtP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> The main point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33783" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapters nineteen through forty</span> is that God’s saved people are brought into the presence of God and into the knowledge of God. Using New Testament terms, the people are brought into fellowship with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5cTplIP0fCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> There is no indication in the first eighteen chapters of Exodus that the children of Israel had been brought into fellowship with God. Although God’s people had experienced God’s salvation, had enjoyed God’s provision, and had been brought into God’s kingdom, they had not yet been brought into such fellowship. However, beginning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33784" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapter nineteen</span>, they are brought into fellowship with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FbRHnmbjPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33785" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3:1</span> speaks of the mountain of God, Horeb. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33786" data-verses="Exodus 3:12">3:12</span> the Lord said to Moses, “When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33787" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapter nineteen</span> we see the children of Israel at the <span class="pg" data-page-id="580" id="580">[580]</span> mountain of God, Mount Sinai, the place where God could contact His people. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33788" data-verses="Exodus 3:12">3:12</span> God said that His people would serve Him on the mountain of God. It is a very significant thing to serve God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33789" data-verses="Exodus 5:1">5:1</span> Moses told Pharaoh to let the people go so that they might hold a feast unto the Lord in the wilderness. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33790" data-verses="Exodus 5:3">5:3</span>, the people were to make a journey of three days into the desert and there sacrifice unto the Lord. To sacrifice unto God is to offer something to Him, and to hold a feast unto God is to enjoy with God what is offered to Him. Up to the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33791" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">chapter eighteen</span>, we have not yet seen the service, the sacrifice, or the feast. Although God’s people had many experiences and much enjoyment, they had not yet begun to serve Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr86__T7ew6MJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33792" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">chapters twelve through fourteen</span> God’s people experienced His redemption and salvation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33793" data-verses="Exodus 15:1">chapters fifteen</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33794" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">sixteen</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33795" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">seventeen</span> they enjoyed God’s provision. The bitter water was made sweet, the people enjoyed the twelve springs and seventy palms at Elim, and they partook of the manna and of the living water from the smitten rock. Through God’s salvation and provision, His people were brought into a position of being in the kingdom of God. In the foregoing message we saw that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33796" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">chapter eighteen</span> is a picture, a type, of the kingdom. We thank the Lord for the light He has shown us from this chapter. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJB-y00OaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> In the early years of my ministry, I gave a number of messages on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33797" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">Exodus 19</span>. Most of those messages, however, were on the negative points. In these messages, I prefer to stay away from the negative points and emphasize the positive ones. We need to have a positive impression of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33798" data-verses="Exodus 19:1-2">Exodus 19 and 20</span>. Many Christian teachers emphasize the negative aspects of these chapters by pointing out that the law is good and spiritual, but we are fleshly, and the law cannot help us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33799" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">Chapter nineteen</span> of Exodus is actually very positive, for here God’s chosen people are brought into fellowship with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-Dwpx8Mx7qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> The distance between Egypt and Mount Sinai was a journey of about three days. I believe this was the reason Moses told Pharaoh that the children of Israel had to take <span class="pg" data-page-id="581" id="581">[581]</span> a journey of three days into the wilderness. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33800" data-verses="Exodus 4:27">4:27</span> indicates that Aaron was charged by God to meet his brother, Moses, at the mount of God in the wilderness. Although the distance from Egypt to Mount Sinai could be traveled in three days, it took the children of Israel more than two months. Although we could have entered into fellowship with God immediately after we were saved, in our experience most of us travel, journey, wander, instead. But in our wandering we enjoy God’s provision. Even though our journey may be under God’s care and according to His leading, we are not yet in fellowship with Him. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33801" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">Exodus 19</span> we have a very precious point—that God now brings His redeemed people into His presence. Prior to that time, they had heard about God. However, they had not heard God’s voice directly. The same is true among many Christians today. Although they have heard about God, they have not experienced God’s direct speaking. Before they came to the mountain of God, the children of Israel heard about God through Moses’ preaching and teaching. But here God brought them directly into His presence. He came down upon the mountain, appeared to the people, and spoke to them. Thus, they heard the voice of God directly and personally, not indirectly through a mediator. In the presence of God they heard His direct speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNFd_oHDbKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> We should not read the book of Exodus simply according to the letters in black and white. Rather, we should regard everything in every chapter of this book as a picture. We have pointed out that every item in Exodus is a picture. Egypt is a picture of the world, and Pharaoh is a picture of Satan. Likewise, the Passover lamb, the crossing of the Red Sea, the manna, the living water from the cleft rock, and Amalek are also pictures. Moreover, Zipporah, Jethro, and the captains in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33802" data-verses="Exodus 18:1">chapter eighteen</span> are pictures related to the kingdom. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33803" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapter nineteen</span> we have a portrait of the fellowship between God’s redeemed people and God Himself. Here His people are brought into the presence of God and into the knowledge of Him. They are brought into the fellowship of God and with God. According to the portrait <span class="pg" data-page-id="582" id="582">[582]</span> presented in this chapter, God is present on earth, on the mountaintop, and the people are gathered around the mountain. What a marvelous sight! </p>

HAVING EXPERIENCED GOD’S FULL SALVATION</h2><p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoaXNbWzqNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> If we would enter into fellowship with God, we need to experience His full salvation. We need to be saved from the condemnation of sin, the world, and Satan, as seen in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33804" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">chapters one through fourteen</span>. Then we need to enjoy God’s rich provision (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33805" data-verses="Exodus 15:1">15:1—17:7</span>), conquer the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33806" data-verses="Exodus 17:8-16">17:8-16</span>), and be brought into the kingdom of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33807" data-verses="Exodus 18:1-27">18:1-27</span>). If we do not have such an experience and enjoyment, we shall not be able to have fellowship with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVIj3NEKXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> Our spiritual experience matches the experience of the children of Israel. First we are saved from sin, the world, and Satan. Then we enjoy God’s provision. The bitter water is changed into sweet, and we eat of manna, the heavenly food, and drink the living water flowing from the smitten rock. Through the enjoyment of these divine provisions, we are equipped to conquer the flesh and subdue it. We should not excuse ourselves by saying that we are weak. If we make such an excuse for ourselves, we shall not come to God’s mountain. The more excuses we make, the more we shall be kept away from the mountain of God. We need to say, “Yes, I am weak, but the Lord is not weak. I have Moses, the heavenly Christ, interceding for me, and I have Joshua, Christ as the life-giving Spirit, dwelling in me and fighting for me.” We have the living Spirit with the cross operating to deal with our flesh. Once the flesh is slain, we are immediately in the kingdom. Then, in the kingdom, we are ushered into God’s presence to enjoy fellowship with Him. Exodus certainly is a portrait of our spiritual experience. If we consider our experience, we shall realize that it corresponds to the record in this book. </p>

The significance of Mount Sinai is that it is the place for God to speak. On Mount Sinai God did not perform miracles. Rather, He simply spoke. With God’s speaking, there is also the heavenly vision. Therefore, the spiritual significance of the mountain of God is that it is the place of God’s speaking with God’s vision. First, the children of Israel heard God speaking; then they saw the vision. This vision was of the pattern for God’s dwelling place on earth. </p>

In the foregoing message we pointed out that in this fellowship with God His people came to know God’s grace and holiness. During the course of this fellowship, the law was given (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33855" data-verses="Exodus 20:1-17">20:1-17</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneHPNN7MHHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM">I. THE LAW AS THE TESTIMONY OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2XQBw1T4UeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33856" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exodus 20</span> has not been properly and adequately understood by many readers. It is commonly thought that this chapter tells us how the law was given. This is correct, but it is not the basic, primary concept. The basic concept in this chapter is that God reveals Himself to His people and thus enables them to know what kind of God He is. He wanted the children of Israel to know what kind of God they were approaching, what kind of God with whom they were having fellowship. It was important for the children of Israel not only to know such divine attributes as grace and holiness, but also to know God Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zCuBamgyXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33857" data-verses="Exodus 20:4">20:4</span> the words image and likeness are used. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33858" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span>, a verse which speaks of the creation of man, also uses the words image and likeness. God created man in His image and according to His likeness. As used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33859" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span>, the words image and likeness refer to God’s Person, to God Himself and to what He is. Hence, man was made <span class="pg" data-page-id="592" id="592">[592]</span> according to what God is. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33860" data-verses="Exodus 20:4">20:4</span>, however, these words are used in a warning: “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33861" data-verses="Exodus 20:3">verse 3</span> the Lord says, “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” The word “before” here actually means besides, in addition to. Thus, the Lord seemed to be saying, “I am the unique One. Before Me, in addition to Me, you should not have any other god. You should not have any other image or likeness. The only image and likeness you should have should be Mine. I am unique and jealous. Do not make for yourselves an image or a likeness of anything.” These verses indicate that the Ten Commandments first speak of God’s image and likeness. In other words, these commandments refer us to God Himself. This indicates that the law does not merely consist of commandments for us to keep. Primarily, the law is a testimony which reveals what kind of God the Lord is. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgYDYvaafwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> Concerning the matter of law, there is an important principle: the kind of law a person makes expresses the kind of person that one is. For example, if criminals could make laws, they would legalize crime. Furthermore, a backward country would have rather barbaric laws, whereas a highly cultured society would have highly cultured laws. This principle applies also to God Himself. God is a Law-giver. In giving the law, He would never legalize crime or sin. He would not legalize theft or adultery, for He is not that kind of God. Only the god of witchcraft would legalize such things. A law is always a revelation of what kind of person has enacted that law. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m5DKoCMoyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> The first function of the law is not to expose us; it is to reveal God to us. Years ago, I emphasized the fact that the law’s function was to expose us. In this message, however, I wish to emphasize the point that the primary function of the law is to reveal God to us. After God brought His people into His presence to have fellowship with Him, to serve Him, to contact Him, to worship Him, and even to feast with Him, He made Himself known to them. Prior to this time, God had <span class="pg" data-page-id="593" id="593">[593]</span> not revealed to His people what kind of God He is. Yes, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33862" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Genesis 17</span> God did tell Abraham that He was perfect, almighty, and all-sufficient. However, that was not an adequate revelation of God Himself. Only when we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33863" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exodus 20</span> do we have a revelation of what kind of God our God is. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh52fqmOovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> This revelation, however, is not given directly. Rather, it is given indirectly through the giving of the law. Apparently <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33864" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exodus 20</span> is concerned with the giving of the law. Actually this chapter is concerned with the unveiling of God Himself. In decreeing the law, God made Himself known to His people. Through the law, they were able to understand what kind of God He is. The divine legislation is a revelation of God Himself. If we would understand this portion of the Word adequately, we must keep this concept firmly in mind. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-2P90Ye189qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33865" data-verses="Deuteronomy 4:13">Deuteronomy 4:13</span> speaks of “ten commandments,” whereas <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33866" data-verses="Exodus 34:28">Exodus 34:28</span> speaks of “ten words” (Heb.). The expression “ten words” is significant. God regards the Ten Commandments, the ten laws, as ten words. This expression is a further indication that the law is God’s revelation of Himself, since the words a person speaks are a revelation of that person. </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB5OJCfIi6RI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33867" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exodus 20</span> does not clearly say which commandment is the first, which is the second, and so on. Although the fourth through the tenth commandments are clearly identified, it is difficult to determine which are the first, second, and third. The Jews understand this in one way, the Catholics in another way, and the Protestants in still another way. In order to have the proper understanding of the Ten Commandments, we should see that they actually begin with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33868" data-verses="Exodus 20:2">verse 2</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33869" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Verse 1</span> is the introduction, and then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33870" data-verses="Exodus 20:2-3">verses 2 and 3</span> continue, “I am Jehovah thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me” (Heb.). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33871" data-verses="Exodus 20:2-3">Verses 2 and 3</span> comprise the first commandment. Notice that in the first commandment the title “Jehovah thy God” is used. The same is true in each of the next four commandments. <span class="pg" data-page-id="594" id="594">[594]</span> However, although the expression “Jehovah thy God” is used in each of the first five commandments, it is not used in any of the last five. The use of the title Jehovah in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33872" data-verses="Exodus 20:2-11">verses 2 through 11</span> gives us reason to join <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33873" data-verses="Exodus 20:3">verse 3</span> with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33874" data-verses="Exodus 20:2">verse 2</span> and thus consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33875" data-verses="Exodus 20:2">verse 2</span> as part of the first commandment. The second commandment is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33876" data-verses="Exodus 20:4-6">verses 4 through 6</span>. Here we are commanded not to make a graven image or likeness of any thing in heaven, on earth, or under the earth, nor to bow down to them, for the Lord is a jealous God. The third commandment, concerning not taking the Lord’s name in vain, is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33877" data-verses="Exodus 20:7">verse 7</span>; and the fourth, regarding the Sabbath day, is recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33878" data-verses="Exodus 20:8-11">verses 8 through 11</span>. The fifth commandment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33879" data-verses="Exodus 20:12">v. 12</span>) is about honoring our father and mother. The remaining five commandments are found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33880" data-verses="Exodus 20:13-17">verses 13 through 17</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZQyz8-FcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> If we read carefully the record of the Ten Commandments, we shall see that they are divided into two groups of five. As we have indicated, in the first group the sacred title “Jehovah thy God” is used with respect to each commandment. But with the second group of five, the name of Jehovah is not mentioned even once. Hence, the use of the Lord’s name is a determining factor in reckoning the arrangement of the Ten Commandments. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-cOgcLxIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> The arrangement of the Ten Commandments may be understood according to the Jewish way, the Catholic way, the Protestant way, or the biblical way. According to the Jewish way, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33881" data-verses="Exodus 20:2">verse 2</span> is regarded as the first commandment, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33882" data-verses="Exodus 20:3-6">verses 3 through 6</span> as the second. According to the Catholic way, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33883" data-verses="Exodus 20:2">verse 2</span> is not regarded as part of the first commandment, only <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33884" data-verses="Exodus 20:3-6">verses 3 through 6</span>. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33885" data-verses="Exodus 20:17">verse 17</span> is reckoned as two distinct commandments. According to the way followed by most Protestants, which is close to the biblical way, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33886" data-verses="Exodus 20:3">verse 3</span> is considered the first commandment, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33887" data-verses="Exodus 20:4-6">verses 4 through 6</span>, the second. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33888" data-verses="Exodus 20:17">verse 17</span> is regarded as the tenth commandment. However, as we have pointed out, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33889" data-verses="Exodus 20:2">verse 2</span> must be included with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33890" data-verses="Exodus 20:3">verse 3</span> as part of the first commandment. This is necessary to have the sacred title, Jehovah, included in each of the first five commandments. <span class="pg" data-page-id="595" id="595">[595]</span> According to the biblical way, the first commandment includes <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33891" data-verses="Exodus 20:2-3">verses 2 and 3</span>; the second, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33892" data-verses="Exodus 20:4-6">verses 4 through 6</span>; the third, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33893" data-verses="Exodus 20:7">verse 7</span>; the fourth, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33894" data-verses="Exodus 20:8-11">verses 8 through 11</span>; the fifth, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33895" data-verses="Exodus 20:12">verse 12</span>; and the sixth through tenth, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33896" data-verses="Exodus 20:13-17">verses 13 through 17</span> respectively. </p>

THE LAW</h2><p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP72pf8T_8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> When I was young, I was influenced by certain books of systematic theology to consider the law as something negative. Concerning the law, a negative impression was made not only on my mind but on my whole being. For many years thereafter, I thought of the law in a negative way. As a person under God’s grace, not under the law, I did not care for the law. As far as I was concerned, the law in the Bible was not positive. However, I gradually came to realize, especially from reading the book of Exodus, that nothing that is of God or from God could ever be negative. On the contrary, everything that comes out from God must be positive. This is true, then, of the Ten Commandments recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33931" data-verses="Exodus 20:1-17">20:1-17</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2kiDkvOlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> If we consider the law only according to our mental knowledge, we shall view it in a negative way. But if we realize that the law was given in a positive situation, we shall see that the law is the living word of God which infuses His substance into His loving seekers. Paul says that the law was ordained through angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="33932" data-verses="Galatians 3:19">Gal. 3:19</span>). However, there is no mention of angels in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33933" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exodus 20</span>. According to this chapter, the law was given directly by God Himself. <span class="pg" data-page-id="604" id="604">[604]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3m3CJ1lUyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> Concerning the giving of the law, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33934" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">verse 1</span> of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33935" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exodus 20</span> is of great significance: “And God spake all these words.” The conjunction “and” joins <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33936" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">chapter twenty</span> with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33937" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapter nineteen</span>. We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33938" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">Exodus 19</span> God brought His people to His mountain to have fellowship with Him. God had brought the people out of Egypt and had gathered them unto Himself at His mountain. This means that God came down from heaven to earth to have fellowship with His people. It was, of course, impossible for man to ascend to heaven, where God was. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33939" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">Exodus 19</span> God descended to a particular mountain, where He could meet with His people. At the very place where God was meeting with His people and where they were contacting Him in fellowship, the law was given. Some theologians may neglect such a picture of the giving of the law. They may have the tendency to exclude God and to concentrate on the law in a negative way. This was the reason that, as a youth, I was given the impression that God in heaven gave the law through the angels to His people on earth. According to this concept, God was far away from His people when the law was given, and they had no way to come into contact with Him. According to this view, the law-giving God did not contact the people, and the law-receiving people did not meet with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTNwgxVRdNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> When I was young, I also was taught, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33940" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1</span>, that the law was given through Moses, but that God did not come to man until the time of Christ’s incarnation. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33941" data-verses="Exodus 19:1-2">Exodus 19 and 20</span>, we see that God did come down to meet with His people before Christ’s incarnation. Even prior to the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33942" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exodus 20</span>, God had appeared to Abraham. But that appearing was on a very small scale. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33943" data-verses="Exodus 19:1-2">Exodus 19 and 20</span>, more than two million people were gathered at the mountain of God when God came down to visit them and to give them His law. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5cTJlOdEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> After God had brought the people out of Egypt to the mountain of God, He began to have fellowship with them and to speak with them. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33944" data-verses="Exodus 31:18">Exodus 31:18</span> indicates that He communed with them. There, at the mountain of God, God was <span class="pg" data-page-id="605" id="605">[605]</span> talking, conversing, having communion, with man. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33945" data-verses="Exodus 19:4-6">19:4-6</span>, God said that He had borne them on eagles’ wings and had brought them to Himself. He also said that they would be His personal possession, His peculiar treasure, and would be unto Him a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These words were part of the very positive conversation between God and His people. Such a conversation was not the decree of certain laws; it was a time of fellowship in which God spoke to His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FbRHHmSxPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33946" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">20:1</span> indicates, the giving of the Ten Commandments was the continuation of this conversation in fellowship. This verse does not say, “And God gave commandments to the people.” It says, “And God spake all these words.” What we have in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33947" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">chapter twenty</span> is not merely a list of commandments. The fact that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33948" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">20:1</span> says that “God spake all these words” shows that the Ten Commandments are God’s words. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33949" data-verses="Exodus 34:28">34:28</span> the commandments are even called “the ten words” (Heb.). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33950" data-verses="2Timothy 3:16">2 Timothy 3:16</span>, all Scripture is God-breathed. This indicates that the Scriptures are God’s breath. God’s speaking is His breathing. Whenever God speaks, His breath conveys His element into the ones who receive His word. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr86__Tbe4ocJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> The conjunction “and” at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33951" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">20:1</span> is very important, for it connects <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33952" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">chapter twenty</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33953" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapter nineteen</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33954" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Chapter twenty</span> is thus the continuation of God’s speaking in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="33955" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapter nineteen</span>. As we have seen, the Ten Commandments are God’s words and are even called the words of God. Have you ever heard that the Ten Commandments are the ten words? There is a big difference between words and commandments. Commandments are requirements that we must keep and fulfill. God’s words, however, are His breath, for God’s speaking is His breathing. By speaking, He breathes something out of Himself and into those who hear His word. The fact that the Ten Commandments are called ten words means that they are not simply laws for us to obey. These commandments are not just so many decrees of divine legislation. God did not merely give His people ten laws, ten commandments; in fellowship with <span class="pg" data-page-id="606" id="606">[606]</span> them He uttered the ten words. If the commandments were nothing more than laws, God’s people could do nothing more than try their best to keep them. But since the Ten Commandments are also God’s words, the very breathing of God, it is possible for those who seek God in love to receive these words into them as God’s very breath. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjma8NXOmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> In the light of this, I would ask you to consider Moses’ experience of spending forty days in communion with God on the mountain. When he came down from the mountain, he had something more than ten commandments inscribed on two tablets of stone. He was a man who had been thoroughly infused with God’s element. During those days of communion on the mountain Moses experienced a divine infusion, the infusion of God’s substance into his very being. However, this matter is not given its rightful place by Christians, who mainly say that God gave Moses the Ten Commandments and that when Moses saw the children of Israel worshipping idols, he threw down the tables of stone in anger and broke them. The Bible indicates that Moses had received not only two tables of stone, but that the very element of God had been infused into him and caused his face to shine. Although Moses could cast down the two tablets and break them, he could not get rid of the transfusion he had received during his time of fellowship with God on the mountain. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD_rzasYW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> In principle, this is also true in our experience with the Lord. Although we may not be able to keep the commandments, we cannot get rid of what is transfused into us when we hear God’s words in times of communion with Him. </p>

<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh52_qicYvIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> In the foregoing message we saw that the law is the living word of God which infuses His substance into His loving seekers. This is a fresh viewpoint concerning the law. Those who seek God will love His law as His living word. Through such a love for God and His word, they will be infused with God’s substance and live in a way which corresponds to what He is. In this message we shall go on to cover a matter which may seem even more unusual. This is the fact that God was seeking lovers when He gave His law to His people in the Old Testament. God’s intention in giving the law to His chosen people was that they become those who love Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-2P9UYZn89qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> Four prophets—Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Hosea—spoke of God as the Husband of the children of Israel and of God’s people as His spouse, His wife. Even though these four prophets lived at different times and in different places, they all had the same concept concerning this matter. To those who are religious, it may sound very strange, even offensive, to say that God has a wife. Nevertheless, the Bible clearly speaks of God as a Husband. How can God be a Husband unless He has a wife? All believers know that God is the Creator, the Redeemer, and the Savior, but many do not realize that God is also a Husband and that His people are His wife. God and His people are a wonderful, universal couple. This is revealed both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament. Addressing the church in Corinth, Paul says, “I <span class="pg" data-page-id="620" id="620">[620]</span> betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34021" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:2">2 Cor. 11:2</span>). According to the New Testament, the church composed of all the believers is the wife of Christ. Likewise, Israel in the Old Testament was espoused to God, betrothed to Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34022" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:2">Jeremiah 2:2</span> speaks of “the love of thy betrothals” (Heb.). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34023" data-verses="Hosea 2:19-20">Hosea 2:19 and 20</span> say, “And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the Lord.” </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB5OJifOwqRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> We need to go on to ask when, where, and how God betrothed Israel unto Himself. We find a hint in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34024" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:2">Jeremiah 2:2</span>, where the Lord says, “I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thy betrothals, how thou followedst after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown” (Heb.). The word kindness here means being kind, nice, courteous. This affectionate feeling and attitude toward God in Israel’s early days was a memorial to God. The “love of thy betrothals” is a particular kind of love. There are a number of different kinds of love. The love of parents for their children is different from that of children for their parents. The love friends have for one another is yet another kind of love. The love in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34025" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:2">Jeremiah 2:2</span> is like that between a man and a woman who are about to be married. This kind of love is very different from that of parents for children, of children for parents, and of a person for his friends. The word love in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34026" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:2">Jeremiah 2:2</span> refers to the love shown in courtship, a romantic love. In particular, it refers to the woman’s reflection of the love of the man who is courting her. God told Israel that He remembered this response to His courting love in her youth. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZQyT83W8JlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34027" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:2">Jeremiah 2:2</span> the Lord specifically mentions “the love of thy betrothals.” This expression denotes the love of Israel at the time of her engagement to the Lord. In this verse the Lord seems to be saying to Israel, “I betrothed you unto Me, and you and I were engaged. From the time of our engagement, you had a special love for Me. I could never forget the love of your youth, when you became engaged <span class="pg" data-page-id="621" id="621">[621]</span> to Me and followed after Me in the wilderness.” Here the Lord speaks of four things He remembers: His people, the kindness of their youth, the love of their betrothals, and how they followed after Him in the wilderness. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34028" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:2">Jeremiah 2:2</span>, therefore, clearly speaks of Israel’s engagement to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-cOAcDi4s4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> Where and when did this engagement take place? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34029" data-verses="Ezekiel 16:8">Ezekiel 16:8</span> says, “Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine.” According to the context of the chapter, this verse refers to the exodus and the time thereafter. Out of a deep love for the people, the Lord entered into a covenant with them. This covenant was enacted at the mountain of God, through the giving of the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34030" data-verses="Exodus 20:1-12">Exo. 20:1-12</span>). Have you ever realized that the giving of the law was a transaction in which God’s people became engaged to Him? </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8666qzFeZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> As we shall see, the law is an engagement covenant, an engagement paper. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34031" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:32">Jeremiah 31:32</span> indicates this: “Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was a husband unto them, saith the Lord.” The covenant here is that mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34032" data-verses="Ezekiel 16:8">Ezekiel 16:8</span>, made at the mountain of God, after God had brought the people out of the land of Egypt. Notice that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34033" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:32">Jeremiah 31:32</span> God speaks of Himself as a Husband taking them by the hand. This indicates that when God gave the law, He was courting His people. We have seen that both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34034" data-verses="Ezekiel 16:8">Ezekiel 16:8</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34035" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:32">Jeremiah 31:32</span> use the word covenant, a word which refers to the law given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34036" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exodus 20</span>. The law was an engagement paper, an engagement covenant. When God gave the law, He betrothed Israel unto Himself, and Israel became engaged to Him. By means of the law as an engagement paper, God officially betrothed the children of Israel to Himself and became their Husband, as indicated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34037" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:32">Jeremiah 31:32</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIDP6IRj-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> <span class="pg" data-page-id="622" id="622">[622]</span> I doubt that very many Christians think of the law as an engagement paper. In the western world, a ring is used as the sign of engagement. But in the Orient it is common for both parties to sign an engagement paper, an engagement agreement. The signing of such a paper shows the importance of engagement and serves as proof that a certain man and woman are engaged to be married. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34038" data-verses="Genesis 24:1">Genesis 24</span> Abraham’s servant arranged for the engagement of Rebekah to Isaac. That engagement was a betrothal, an espousal. The betrothal of Israel to God took place at the mountain of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34039" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exodus 20</span>, and the law was the official paper stating the conditions for this engagement. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbAPPdgI7HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> The law gave the terms for the engagement between God and His people. The conditions for God’s engagement with Israel were the Ten Commandments. If we do not interpret the giving of the Ten Commandments in this way, how shall we expound <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34040" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:2">Jeremiah 2:2</span>, which speaks of the kindness of Israel’s youth and the love of her betrothals? No doubt the time following the exodus from Egypt was the period of Israel’s youth. We may say that the first nineteen chapters of Exodus are chapters in which God was courting, wooing, even “dating” His people. He wanted to be their unique Beloved. His desire was that the people would love Him and Him alone. Thus, God was the loving One seeking His people’s love. God was to be Israel’s Beloved, and the people were to be His love. </p>

<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYIBDIOS6zJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> In this message we shall continue our consideration of God’s giving His law to the people in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34087" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exodus 20</span>. As all students of the Bible realize, the law is a very important subject both in the Old Testament and in the New. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l6D0gGc8l6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> If we would have a proper understanding of God’s giving of the law in the Scriptures, we need to know how this matter is related to the main subject of the Bible as a whole. To understand any book, or even part of a book, we must first learn what is the main subject of the book. Suppose the subject of a certain book is love. But in that book suppose there also are a number of references to the subject of law. If a reader of the book takes these references out of context and gives them an improper emphasis, he will change the subject of the book from love to law. In seeking to understand the place of God’s law in the Scriptures many Christians have done this very thing. Failing to understand the law in the light of the main subject of the Bible as a whole, they do not have a proper, balanced view of the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBluT77fFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> We have pointed out a number of times that virtually everything in the universe has two sides, or two aspects. For example, during a regular twenty-four hour period, we have both day and night. Would it not be absurd for someone to <span class="pg" data-page-id="632" id="632">[632]</span> insist that there is only day or only night? As sure as night falls, a new day dawns. We can neither prolong the day nor extend the night. This illustration of day and night may be applied to God’s giving of the law. Concerning the law, there are two aspects, two sides: the aspect of “night,” the dark side, and the aspect of “day,” the bright side. In these messages we are covering the “day” aspect, not the “night” aspect, which we shall cover later. We need to give the proper emphasis to both aspects. Now that we are covering the “day” aspect of the law, we are pointing out what is clear and bright. But when we turn to the “night” aspect, we shall point out what is dark. I do not intend to cheat the Lord’s people by failing to point out both aspects. In considering the two aspects of God’s giving of the law, I am not contradictory. To the contrary, I am simply presenting both sides of the truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Bhtzj14Mk5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> Concerning God’s giving the law to His people, the main aspect is not the “night” aspect. God did not create the universe so that there could be night. Night is necessary, but it is not God’s goal. God’s goal is to have an eternal day. A verse which speaks of New Jerusalem in eternity, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34088" data-verses="Revelation 21:25">Revelation 21:25</span>, says, “Night shall not be there.” Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34089" data-verses="Revelation 22:5">Revelation 22:5</span> declares, “Night shall be no more.” When God’s purpose has reached its ultimate fulfillment in the New Jerusalem, there will be no night in that eternal city. By this we see that God’s goal is to have day, not night. </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36VA1LLNBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> As Paul says, we are “of the day,” even “sons of the day” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34090" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:8">1 Thes. 5:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34091" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:5">5</span>). However, in discussing the giving of God’s law, many Christian teachers place too great an emphasis on the aspect of “night.” I am by no means asserting that they pay no attention at all to the “day” side. I am simply pointing out the fact that their emphasis is on the aspect of “night.” Thus, there certainly is the need for us to cover the “day” side of the law as well as the “night” side. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0MyB29LYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> If we would have the proper realization of what God’s law is, we need to know what God’s eternal purpose is. God’s eternal purpose is to have a people to express Him. In order for this purpose to be fulfilled, God must impart Himself <span class="pg" data-page-id="633" id="633">[633]</span> into His chosen people and work Himself into them. This is the reason that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34092" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span>, God created man in a very particular way—in His own image and according to His likeness. God created man in His own image and according to His likeness so that man could take God in and contain Him. God wants man to be His container. This is the reason the Bible speaks of man as a vessel, a vessel of honor and of glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34093" data-verses="Romans 9:23">Rom. 9:23</span>). Man is a vessel to contain God. </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneHPMd7LVHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> The New Testament clearly and emphatically reveals that in Christ and through Christ God has come to us to dispense Himself into us. God does not simply come to visit us. He desires to make His abode with us. The Lord Jesus said, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34094" data-verses="John 14:23">John 14:23</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34095" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">Colossians 1:27</span> Paul speaks of “Christ in you, the hope of glory.” Other verses also indicate definitely that Christ is in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34096" data-verses="Romans 8:10">Rom. 8:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34097" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:5">2 Cor. 13:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34098" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34099" data-verses="Galatians 4:19">4:19</span>). We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34100" data-verses="Ephesians 4:6">Ephesians 4:6</span> that the Father is in us and from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34101" data-verses="John 14:17">John 14:17</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34102" data-verses="Romans 8:11">Romans 8:11</span> that the Spirit dwells in us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34103" data-verses="1John 4:12">First John 4:12</span> says, “God abides in us.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34104" data-verses="1John 4:15">Verse 15</span> of the same chapter declares, “Whoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.” This matter of dwelling in God and God dwelling in us is repeated several times in 1 John. Again and again, the New Testament points out that God dwells in us. We are even called God’s temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34105" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:16">1 Cor. 3:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34106" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:19">6:19</span>) and His dwelling place, His house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34107" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">Eph. 2:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34108" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">1 Tim. 3:15</span>). God houses Himself in us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34109" data-verses="Ephesians 3:17">Ephesians 3:17</span> indicates that Christ is making His home in our hearts. Only when God works Himself into our being are we able to express Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2XRRwzBoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> Many Christians today neglect this crucial matter of God dispensing Himself into us and working Himself into us. When we expound this point and emphasize its importance, we are accused by some of teaching pantheism or even “evolution into God.” What blindness! Yes, we teach that God desires to work Himself into man, but we certainly do not teach that man is evolving into the Godhead or that man will ever attain to the status of deity. Those who accuse us of <span class="pg" data-page-id="634" id="634">[634]</span> holding such a doctrine are in darkness. Time and time again we must emphasize the basic matter that, according to the divine revelation in the Scriptures, God desires to be one with His people and to make them one with Him. We do not have the full understanding of how intensely God longs to be one with us and to make us one with Him. Those who think this is “evolution into God” are grossly ignorant of God’s economy revealed in the New Testament. In the light of God’s Word, we see that He wants to come into us and dwell in us and cause us to dwell in Him. In this way, He and we, we and He, become one. </p>

TO KEEP THE LAW OF GOD BY LOVING HIM</h2><p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgYCIvSJvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> Although God is divine and we are human, it is still possible for us to be one with Him. But in order for God to be one with us and for us to be one with Him, there must be love between us and God. Unless there is mutual love, it is not possible for a man and woman to live together as husband and wife and remain truly one. The genuine oneness between a man and his wife is wholly a matter of love. Love is the motive and incentive for such a oneness. If I did not love my wife, I could not live with her in oneness. For two persons to be one, they must love each other. This is also true of the relationship between God and His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjI2B6ixws7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> Without God, we are empty, and everything is vain. If we did not have God, we would have to say with the writer of Ecclesiastes, “Vanity of vanities; all is vanity” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34110" data-verses="Ecclesiastes 1:2">1:2</span>). But since we have God, we have reality. </p>

<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGo9pB4LvVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> Throughout the centuries, God has had a romance with man. God created man with the purpose of having a counterpart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34165" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Gen. 1:26</span>). His intention in creating man was not mainly to have servants. If we read the Bible in a pure way, without any preoccupations, we shall realize that God’s purpose in creating man was to gain a counterpart. God is not a fighter; He is a lover. He created man in the image of Himself as a lover. This means that He created man so that man would love Him. In eternity God was alone; we may even say that He was lonely. His desire for love could not be fulfilled by angels. Therefore, God created man according to His own being. God is loving, and He wants man to love Him. In this way there will be a mutual relationship of love between God and mankind, those created to be His counterpart. </p>

Choosing Israel to Be His Spouse</h2><p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQaxRNszwAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> The Old Testament indicates clearly that God came in to choose Israel to be His spouse. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34166" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:3">Jeremiah 31:3</span> the Lord <span class="pg" data-page-id="646" id="646">[646]</span> says, “Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.” When God appeared to His people, He “dated” them and later even courted them. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34167" data-verses="Ezekiel 16:1">Ezekiel 16</span>, God loved Israel when He saw her in the wilderness. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34168" data-verses="Ezekiel 16:8">Verse 8</span> describes this love: “Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine.” By entering into a covenant with Israel, God betrothed her to Himself. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34169" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:2">Jeremiah 2:2</span> also speaks of this covenant, this engagement: “I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thy betrothals, how thou followedst after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown” (Heb.). This verse indicates that the covenant was enacted in the wilderness after God had brought the children of Israel out of Egypt. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34170" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">Chapters one through nineteen</span> of Exodus were the time of Israel’s youth. The Lord remembered the kindness of Israel’s youth and the love of her betrothals. I have wondered how much Israel actually loved God in this way. Perhaps in this verse the Lord was comforting Himself as does a young man who tries to encourage himself when the one he loves fails to respond to his wooing. Such a young man might be encouraged if the one he loves even looks at him. Where in the first nineteen chapters of Exodus do we see the love of Israel’s betrothals to God? Where do we find such an espousing love? Although it is difficult for us to find, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34171" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:2">Jeremiah 2:2</span> nonetheless tells us that the Lord remembers the love of Israel’s betrothals and the kindness of her youth. It seems to me that Israel was not so kind, polite, or courteous to the Lord. Yet Jeremiah tells us that He remembered the kindness of Israel’s youth. The expressions used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34172" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:2">Jeremiah 2:2</span> reveal how much God loved the children of Israel. In a sense, we might say that God was blinded by His love for His people. After creating man, He chose a people, the children of Israel, to be His spouse. <span class="pg" data-page-id="647" id="647">[647]</span> </p>

Coming to Be the Bridegroom for the Bride</h2><p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGqCzw6BePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> When the Lord Jesus came, He came as the Bridegroom for the bride. Many Christians are familiar with John the Baptist’s declaration: “Behold, the Lamb of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34173" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>). However, not so many realize that John also referred to the Lord Jesus as the Bridegroom. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34174" data-verses="John 3:29">John 3:29</span> he says, “He who has the bride is the bridegroom.” This word is included in a chapter on regeneration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34175" data-verses="John 3:3-6">John 3:3-6</span>). The goal of regeneration is to produce and prepare the bride for the Bridegroom. Since Christ is the One who will have the bride, He is the Bridegroom. As God incarnate, Christ came not only to be our Redeemer and Savior; He also came to be our Bridegroom. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJjuvKGKvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34176" data-verses="Matthew 9:15">Matthew 9:15</span> the Lord Jesus referred to Himself as the Bridegroom. To the blind religionists who were asking Him about fasting, the Lord said, “Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.” In dealing with the question raised by the disciples of John, the Lord revealed Himself as the Bridegroom coming to receive the bride. In their blindness, the religionists could not see that Christ was the Bridegroom. It is crucial that our eyes be opened to see the Lord as our Bridegroom. </p>

Regenerating the Church to Be His Bride</h2><p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2Cyc4YBr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> The Lord Jesus regenerates the church so that the church may be His bride (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34177" data-verses="John 3:3">John 3:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34178" data-verses="John 3:5">5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34179" data-verses="John 3:29-30">29-30</span>). The Lord is the Bridegroom with the divine life and the divine nature. If we would become His bride, we must also have the divine life and the divine nature. For this, regeneration is necessary. Apart from possessing this life and nature, we could never become Christ’s counterpart. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34180" data-verses="John 3:1">John 3</span> we see that regeneration qualifies us to be Christ’s bride. Only after we have been regenerated with the divine life and have thereby received the divine nature can we, sinners, be taken by Christ to be His love. He is so high, possessing the divine life and nature, and we are so low. How can we become His <span class="pg" data-page-id="648" id="648">[648]</span> counterpart? This is possible only by regeneration. Through regeneration we receive another life, the divine life. In this life and by this life we are qualified to become Christ’s counterpart and to match Him. </p>

Marrying His Redeemed as His Wife</h2><p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9IjpplJSHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> At the end of this age, Christ will come to marry His redeemed and to take her as His wife (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34181" data-verses="Revelation 19:7">Rev. 19:7</span>). The present age is an age of “dating,” courtship, and engagement between God and His people. At the end of this dispensation, there will be a glorious wedding day, at which time Christ will marry His redeemed ones. This revelation of the marriage between Christ and His redeemed ones is a major revelation in the Bible. </p>

For eternity in the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem will be the wife of the Lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34182" data-verses="Revelation 21:9">Rev. 21:9</span>).

This means that the Bible is a very romantic book. This is true in particular of Song of Songs. Certain modernists doubt whether Song of Songs should be included in the Bible. Even some proper Christian teachers have had doubts about this book. When I was young, I also wondered why such a book is in the Bible, a book concerned with a romance between a man and a woman. This book is a portrait of the love relationship between us and Christ. According to Song of Songs, our relationship with the Lord should be very romantic. If there is no romance between us and the Lord Jesus, then we are religious Christians, not romantic Christians. If you wish to know what I mean by romance, I would encourage you to read and pray-read Song of Songs. Pray-reading this book of romance will cause you to become romantic with the Lord. <span class="pg" data-page-id="649" id="649">[649]</span> You will be beside yourself with love for Him. The Bible is a divine romance, and our relationship with the Lord should become more and more romantic. </p>

Again and again in the Scriptures, God comes to man in this way. Two examples are God’s coming to Jacob at Bethel the first time (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34183" data-verses="Genesis 28:10-22">Gen. 28:10-22</span>) and also the second time (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34184" data-verses="Genesis 35:9-15">Gen. 35:9-15</span>). Another example is God’s coming to Moses at Mount Horeb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34185" data-verses="Exodus 3:1-17">Exo. 3:1-17</span>). </p>

The longest piece in the book of Psalms, this psalm was written according to the sequence of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, with each of its twenty-two sections using eight verses for each of the twenty-two Hebrew letters. Thus, this psalm of one hundred seventy-six verses has more verses than the whole book of Ephesians. Due to its length, it is difficult to cover in a brief way. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVIiXNCZne1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> The foregoing messages on the law of God should be helpful to us in understanding <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34246" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span>. The psalmist did not write this psalm according to theology. Rather, it was written according to his sentiment and experience, according to the deep aspiration of his heart, and according to his enjoyment of the law. The psalmists expressed their hunger, thirst, and desire for the Lord. Like all the psalms, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34247" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> is filled with aspiration, not with doctrine. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34248" data-verses="Psalms 119:131">Verse 131</span> says, “I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.” Here the psalmist uses the word panted, a word also used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34249" data-verses="Psalms 42:1">Psalm 42:1</span>: “As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.” The note in one version says that in Hebrew the word pant refers to the longing for a cool spring after suffering burning heat. The use of this word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34250" data-verses="Psalms 119:131">Psalm 119:131</span> and <span class="pg" data-page-id="658" id="658">[658]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34251" data-verses="Psalms 42:1">42:1</span> shows the deep sentiment and aspiration of the psalmists. The psalmists thirsted and panted after God. Hence, although <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34252" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> has much to say about the law, it does not speak about the law from the perspective of doctrine, but from the viewpoint of spiritual experience. This psalm was written by one who dealt with the law in the way of enjoyment. In this message and in the next, we shall look into <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34253" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> to consider how the Old Testament seekers of God enjoyed His law. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJt0cu-3Hiqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h">I. SEEKING GOD</h2><p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRA6LqguxmTX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34254" data-verses="Psalms 119:2">Psalm 119:2</span> tells us that those who enjoyed God’s law in the Old Testament were seekers of God: “Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.” The writer of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34255" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> was such a seeker. Many Christians are not familiar with the term “seekers of God,” even though this concept is biblical. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34256" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span>, seeking God is related to keeping the law. If you try to keep the law without having a heart to seek God, your efforts will be in vain. This was the serious shortcoming of the Judaizers at the time of Paul. Trying to keep the law without seeking God with their whole heart, they failed in their endeavor to fulfill the law’s requirements. If we want to walk according to God’s law, we must seek Him with our whole heart. </p>

When the psalmist awoke during the night, he remembered the Lord’s name. What we remember in the night reveals our true interest, even the thing that occupies us. What do you think of when you wake up at night? If you are one who seeks God, you will remember His name. His name will be your special interest. <span class="pg" data-page-id="659" id="659">[659]</span> Young people, I hope that when you awake during the night, you will not dwell on worldly things, but will remember the sweet, precious name of the Lord. Like the Old Testament saints, may we all love the Lord’s name and remember it, even in the middle of the night. </p>

ENTREATING HIS COUNTENANCE</h2><p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vVqSNrhF6d_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34259" data-verses="Psalms 119:58">Psalm 119:58</span> says, “I entreated thy face with my whole heart” (Heb.). The King James Version uses the word favor instead of face. To seek a person’s face is actually to seek his favor. If we entreat the Lord’s face, His countenance, we shall receive bounty. Often little children will earnestly seek the face of their mother. To them nothing is more dear than beholding their mother’s face. We also should seek the Lord in such an intimate way, entreating His countenance. The Lord’s countenance brings His favor to the seeking one. For whatever the psalmist needed, he would entreat God’s countenance. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4fpZY07VCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34260" data-verses="Psalms 105:4">Psalm 105:4</span> says, “Seek the Lord, and his strength: seek his face evermore.” According to this verse, we need to seek God’s face continually. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34261" data-verses="Psalms 42:5">Psalm 42:5</span> the psalmist praises God “for the help of his countenance.” In a deeply personal and intimate way, the psalmist sought the help of the Lord’s countenance. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP73pf6AP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8">IV. ASKING FOR HIS FACE TO SHINE UPON THEM</h2><p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2kjDkmdlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> The Old Testament seekers of God also prayed that the Lord’s face would shine upon them. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34262" data-verses="Psalms 119:135">Psalm 119:135</span> says, “Make thy face to shine upon thy servant.” This thought is based upon the second aspect of the priests’ blessing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34263" data-verses="Numbers 6:24-26">Numbers 6:24-26</span>: “The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.” No doubt, this threefold blessing refers to the blessing of the Trinity: the blessing of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. With respect to the Son’s blessing, there is mention of the Lord’s face shining upon the people. Prayer for the shining of God’s face is also found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34264" data-verses="Psalms 4:6">Psalm 4:6</span> and in <span class="pg" data-page-id="660" id="660">[660]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34265" data-verses="Psalms 80:3">80:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34266" data-verses="Psalms 80:7">7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34267" data-verses="Psalms 80:19">19</span>, where the psalmist prays, “Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine.” The Old Testament seeking saints were not people who merely endeavored to keep the law in letters. They lovingly sought God in an intimate way, even asking Him to cause His face to shine upon them. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3m2CJ92EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> If we do not have such a heart to seek the Lord, we shall not care for the shining of His face. Even if He caused His face to shine upon us, we would not be conscious of that shining. To sense the shining of the Lord’s face we need a seeking heart. If we are those who seek the Lord in an intimate way, we shall sense the shining of His face. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34268" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>, we can experience this shining: “Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts for the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.” Praise the Lord that we can experience the shining of His face! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9qAuvN1w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm">V. WALKING IN HIS PRESENCE</h2><p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC40XY-H5C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> If the Lord’s face shines upon us, we shall automatically walk in His presence. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34269" data-verses="Psalms 119:168">119:168</span> the psalmist declares, “All my ways are before thee.” This indicates that his goings were in the Lord’s presence. This is a clear indication that the psalmist was one with the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTbMAQBAX1FgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> Although the matter of oneness with God is revealed in a full way in the New Testament, there are also indications of this in the Old Testament. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34270" data-verses="Psalms 90:1">Psalm 90:1</span> says, “Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.” Written by Moses, this verse indicates that he experienced the Lord as his dwelling place. God was his home, his habitation. But notice that Moses speaks of “all generations.” This tells us that the Old Testament saints in all generations had the experience of dwelling in God. The seekers of God in the Old Testament dwelt in Him; they were one with Him. To dwell in God is to be one with Him. How could these seekers dwell in God without being in God and one with God? If we study the Psalms carefully, we shall see that the seekers of God in the Old Testament became one with Him through <span class="pg" data-page-id="661" id="661">[661]</span> their appreciation and enjoyment of the law. They not only walked in God’s presence; they dwelt in God, experiencing Him as their dwelling place. </p>

Like all the other psalms, this psalm was not written according to doctrine or theology, but according to the deep sentiment and aspiration of the psalmist. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqc-R6COT0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> The writer of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34353" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> uses many different terms to express how he enjoyed God’s law as His living word and how he handled it as God’s word. In the foregoing message we pointed out that the psalmist inclined his heart unto it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34354" data-verses="Psalms 119:36">v. 36</span>), sought it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34355" data-verses="Psalms 119:45">v. 45</span>), and longed for it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34356" data-verses="Psalms 119:20">v. 20</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34357" data-verses="Psalms 119:74">verse 74</span> he declared, “I have hoped in thy word.” To hope in something is to wait for it. When the psalmist said that he hoped in God’s word, he meant that he was waiting on the word of God and waiting for it. He was waiting on God for a word. Furthermore, he put his trust in God’s word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34358" data-verses="Psalms 119:42">v. 42</span>). When we put all these matters together, we find that they correspond to our spiritual experience. Having a heart inclined unto the Word of God, we seek the Word, long for it, and hope in it. Then we place our trust in the word we have received of God. </p>

Musing upon It</h2><p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0Myx21ZoJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> In a number of verses the psalmist says that he mused upon God’s word (15, 23, 48, 78, 99, 148, Heb.). In each of these verses the King James Version uses the word meditate. <span class="pg" data-page-id="670" id="670">[670]</span> However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34359" data-verses="Psalms 55:17">Psalm 55:17</span>, the King James Version translates the same Hebrew word as pray. This Hebrew word is also used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34360" data-verses="Genesis 24:63">Genesis 24:63</span>, where we are told that Isaac went out in the field to meditate, or, as the margin says, to pray. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34361" data-verses="Psalms 143:5">Psalm 143:5</span> also uses this word: “I remember the days of old; I ponder all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands” (Heb.). Rich in meaning, the Hebrew word for muse, or meditate, implies to bow down, to converse with oneself, and to utter. According to the Old Testament, to meditate on the Word of God is to enjoy it by musing upon it. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9IjpJlJQHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> To muse upon the Word is to “chew the cud,” like a cow eating grass (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34362" data-verses="Leviticus 11:3">Lev. 11:3</span>). As we muse upon the Word of God, we should “chew the cud.” If we take in the Word too quickly, we shall not have very much enjoyment. But if we “chew the cud” as we take in the Word, our enjoyment will increase. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGo9JBwZfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> When we muse upon the Word of God, enjoying it and even chewing it as a cow chews the cud, we shall spontaneously pray. Prayer is also included in musing upon the Word. Furthermore, we may converse with ourselves or begin to praise the Lord. We may be so inspired by the Word that we want to shout our praises to the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPU8nkqvJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> Usually musing upon the Word will be slower and finer than pray-reading the Word. For example, in our musing upon <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34363" data-verses="Exodus 20:2">Exodus 20:2</span> we may say to ourselves, “Remember that Jehovah is your Lord. He has brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Now you are out. Amen! O Lord, I worship You for bringing me out of bondage!” In all our musing upon God’s Word, talking to the Lord or conversing with ourselves, we should be spontaneous and full of enjoyment. We may bow down to worship the Lord, ponder the Word, remember, or give ourselves a rebuke. All this is included in the practice of musing upon the Word of God. Any genuine seeker of the Lord who muses upon the Ten Commandments in a living way will enjoy the Lord, worship Him, pray, converse with himself in the Lord’s presence, and also praise the Lord. Surely one who takes the law of God in such a way will not apply it as dead letters, but will take it as God’s living word. <span class="pg" data-page-id="671" id="671">[671]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnC8hORr9fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> To muse upon the Word of God is to enjoy His Word as His breath. It is to contact God in the Word and to have fellowship with Him, to worship Him, and to pray to Him through and with the Word. By musing upon the Word of God in this way, we shall be infused by God, breathe Him into us, and receive spiritual nourishment. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJB_C00PaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> Concerning musing upon the Word, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34364" data-verses="Psalms 119:147">verse 147</span> says, “I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.” Here we see that the psalmist rose up before dawn, cried out, and hoped in God’s word. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34365" data-verses="Psalms 119:148">Verse 148</span> goes on to say, “Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might muse upon thy word” (Heb.). The psalmist woke up during the night to muse upon God’s word. Musing upon the Word involves more than just meditating on it. We muse upon the Word by talking to God, worshipping Him, enjoying Him, receiving grace from Him, and conversing with ourselves in the Lord’s presence. We cannot describe adequately the practice of musing on the Word of God and the enjoyment this affords us. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-DwpwMMx6qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> The seekers of God in the Old Testament mused upon His living word. Their way of handling the Word of God was different from that followed by many today who mainly exercise their mind to study the Word in letter. As the psalmists mused upon the Word of God, they spoke to God, prayed, worshipped Him, and even bowed down to Him. In the presence of God, they spoke to themselves of His mercy, salvation, and gracious supply. Musing upon the Word in this way is even richer, broader, and more inclusive than pray-reading, for it includes prayer, worship, enjoyment, conversation, bowing down, and even lifting up our hands to receive God’s word. It also includes rejoicing, praising, shouting, and even weeping before the Lord. In <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em> there is a place where the pilgrim reads the Bible and weeps, shouts, and repents. This indicates that he not only read the Scriptures, but also mused upon them. If we muse upon the Word of God, we shall delight ourselves in the Word. Sometimes we may weep before the Lord or sing hymns of praise to Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="672" id="672">[672]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNFd-YHDaKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> The psalmist waited for the Lord’s word, hoped in it, and arose before dawn to cry out to the Lord that he needed His word. Then he mused upon the Word, worshipping the Lord, praying to Him, and receiving His supply. He also spoke to himself and instructed himself with the Word of God. All this is part of musing upon the Word of God. </p>

Considering It</h2><p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoaXMrWzpNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> In addition to musing upon the Word of God, the psalmist also considered it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34366" data-verses="Psalms 119:95">119:95</span>). In our spiritual experience we also consider the Word of God. Throughout the day we may consider what we enjoyed in our musing upon the Word in the morning. By recalling our enjoyment of the Lord in the Word, we receive further nourishment from the Word. </p>

The word “right” here does not mean right as opposed to wrong. It means upright, straight, strict in all things. When we muse upon the Word and consider it, we shall regard it upright in all things. </p>

The Hebrew word for entrance means an opening, a gate, and it implies entering in. God’s Word has an entrance through which we may get into it. Let us learn to enter into the Word of God. Light is not outside the Word; it is in the Word. When we enter into the Word of God, we shall be in the light that shines there. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5cSZlNdkfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer">Q.

Through suffering and affliction we learn His law. Inwardly we have faculties created by God by which we can understand His Word, and outwardly we have the environment and the circumstances by which we are disciplined. God allows us to be afflicted so that we may learn the Word of God. </p>

<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wN2u23Os_l3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> In this message, another message on the “day” aspect of the law, we shall consider the function of God’s law as His living word to His loving seekers. If we would know how God’s law functions in this way, we must consider the law not only as regulations and commandments given by God, but even more as the word out of God’s mouth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34419" data-verses="Psalms 119:13">Psalm 119:13</span> speaks of “the judgments of thy mouth,” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34420" data-verses="Psalms 119:72">verse 72</span> of “the law of thy mouth,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34421" data-verses="Psalms 119:88">verse 88</span> of “the testimony of thy mouth.” These verses indicate that the law came out of the mouth of God. As God’s living word, the law is the divine breath, the very breath of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4frq-OwKTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> Furthermore, if we would enjoy the function of God’s law as His living word, we need to be God’s loving seekers, those who seek Him out of love. If we do not regard God’s law as His breath and if we do not lovingly seek Him, we shall not experience the positive function of the law. We may read the words of the law, but we shall not be supplied with what God is by the law, and the law will not operate in us in a positive way. In other words, we shall not experience the function of God’s law as His living word. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj9B73HOVIFazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> Suppose you want to use a certain electrically powered machine. If the machine is to function, it must be plugged into an electrical outlet. It would be foolish to expect a machine to run if it has not been plugged in. When electricity flows into the machine, the machine will operate. Moreover, you need to be alert and pay attention to the machine. You <span class="pg" data-page-id="678" id="678">[678]</span> should not turn it on and then go to sleep, expecting it to run on its own. In like manner, if we want the Word of God to function properly in our experience, we need to be “plugged in” to the divine current whenever we read it. We do this by taking the Word into us as the very breath of God. Also, we should not be sleepy or indifferent. We must be God’s genuine seekers. Then in our experience we shall have the functions of the Word of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_bQzF21ANcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> When we speak of the function of the law as the living word of God, we are actually speaking of the function or operation of God Himself. The function of the Word of God is the operation of God. Because the Word of God is the breath of God, it is one with God. Just as it is not possible to separate the breath of a living person from the person himself, so we should not separate the Word of God from God Himself. This is the error made by many Jews in reading the Old Testament and by many Christians in reading the Bible as a whole. They read the Scriptures and study them, but in so doing they do not have direct contact with God. The result is that in their hands the Bible becomes a book of dead letters. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vVqRtrpXqd_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34422" data-verses="John 5:39-40">John 5:39 and 40</span> the Lord Jesus said to the Pharisees, “You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life, and it is these that testify concerning Me; and you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.” Although the ancient religionists researched the Scriptures, they separated them from the Lord Himself and would not come to Him to receive eternal life. Eternal life is in Christ. If we read the Bible without contacting Him, we shall not receive life. Then in our experience the Bible will be a book of dead letters. Life is a living Person, Christ Himself. We should not separate the Scriptures from this living Person. The functions of the law as God’s living word are actually the moving and working of God Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9qDOvN3w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> As God’s living word, the law gives man light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34423" data-verses="Psalms 119:105">Psa. 119:105</span>). Only God is light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34424" data-verses="1John 1:5">1 John 1:5</span>). In themselves the printed letters of the Bible are not light and cannot give us light. At most, the Bible in letters can give us knowledge. Light comes only from God Himself. Thus, if we would <span class="pg" data-page-id="679" id="679">[679]</span> receive light from the Word of God, we must contact God as we read it. This indicates that the function of the Word of God is the function of God Himself, God’s own working. For this reason, we do not want to use the Bible to form a systematic theology. Our aim is to enjoy the Word with its living functions. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC40U4-H7C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> There is no doubt that in reading the Bible we need to exercise our mind to understand the words and terms of Scripture. Using reference books and concordances, we may spend hours to study a single word. From experience I can testify that such study is exhausting to the soul. Sometimes it even suppresses the spirit. However, this kind of study of the Word of God is useful if our aim is to experience and enjoy the living functions of the Word. On the one hand, we need to be exercised to study the Scriptures. On the other hand, there is a time to forget studying and exercise our spirit to pray with the Word and over the Word, seeking to contact the Lord in and through the Word. If we contact the Lord by praying with the Word, we shall receive life from the Word. Then the Word will not be dead letters, for through the exercise of our spirit we shall touch the living One in the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTbMDwBDXVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> Before I come to minister the Word to the saints, I need to spend a good period of time contacting the Lord in this way. Otherwise, I shall not have anything of life to share. I get ready for a message not only by studying the Word, but especially by breathing in the Lord and by praying, praising, and thanking the Lord. In my prayer to the Lord, I do not care about language, grammar, or composition. My only desire is to utter something to the Lord that I may contact Him in a living way. If we are concerned about composing our prayer, our spirit will be weakened. But if we forget composition and exercise our spirit in prayer, we shall contact the living One. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8BJu1K3xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> Again and again we need to come to the Word for the purpose of receiving nourishment and refreshment.

However, many times we do not come to the Word in this way. We neither pray nor aspire to contact the Lord. Instead, we just read the words of the Bible with our eyes and try to understand them with our mind. We have no heart or spirit to contact the Lord. In such a case, the more we read the Word, the more exhausted we become. We need to exercise our spirit in reading the Word, and we need to aspire to contact the Lord. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34425" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> is filled with such an aspiration. This was the reason that to the psalmist the law was God’s living word. His way to contact the Word of God and God Himself was to exercise his whole being as an expression of his intimate sentiment and deep aspiration. As he read the Word, he cried out to God, earnestly seeking Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYICDIKB6zJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> As we read the Word of God, we should not only pray, but also sing to the Lord. This is to read the Word by psalming. (In ancient times the Psalms were sung and not merely read or spoken.) Praying requires more exercise of the spirit than speaking, and singing requires even more exercise than praying. By singing we can truly get into our spirit. We need more singing both in the meetings and in our daily life. </p>

To the loving seekers of God these functions are the blessing received through God’s law as His living word. In this message and in the message following we shall consider the blessing we may receive from the living Word of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTbMDgBEFVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> Although the loving seekers of God receive blessing from His Word, it is possible to come to the Word of God and not receive anything. I know of many who have read the Bible and even studied it without receiving anything from it. This is the situation among many Christians today. When they read the Scriptures, many Christians do not receive any blessing. The only thing they get is vain knowledge. Using the knowledge they gain from reading the Bible, they engage in controversies over matters in the Bible. Instead of being truly helped by reading the Bible, they argue about the Word of God. As a result, first they themselves are killed by their kind of Bible knowledge, and then they use this knowledge to kill others. To them, the Bible is not a book that gives life; it is a book that kills. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8BJ-1Mlhnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> Throughout the centuries, many have been killed by taking the Bible as nothing more than a book of knowledge. Perhaps the most striking example of those killed through Bible knowledge is the so-called higher critics of the Scriptures in the nineteenth century. In their study of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="690" id="690">[690]</span> Bible, these higher critics exercised their mind to an extreme. Consequently, they did not receive any blessing from their study of the Word of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m5DIoCF6SQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> If our condition is normal, we should be helped and very much blessed whenever we come to the Word of God. If we do not receive any blessing, there must be something wrong with us. All Scripture is God-breathed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34482" data-verses="2Timothy 3:16">2 Tim. 3:16</span>); therefore, the words of the Bible are God’s breath. Furthermore, as the embodiment of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34483" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>), the Lord Jesus is Himself called the Word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34484" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34485" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34486" data-verses="Revelation 19:13">Rev. 19:13</span>). Thus, coming to the Word should be the equivalent of coming to God. Because the Word is the embodiment of God, it contains the riches of God. The Word of God contains all that God is. This is the reason the Word of God is so rich, substantial, living, and enlightening. All that God can be to us, the Word can be also. Provided we have no problems within us which cause a hindrance, we should receive blessing whenever we come to the Word of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh50fqucYvIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3">PROBLEMS OF THE HEART</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoaXPLWzrNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky">No Exercise of Heart </h2>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVIhnNELXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> If you fail to receive help when you come to the Word, there is probably a problem of some kind in your heart. Your heart is not right. It may be that you have no genuine exercise of heart in coming to the Word. You read the Bible, but you have no heart for the Word. In human life it is possible to do many things out of necessity without having a heart for those things. For example, a young person may be forced to attend school, but he may have no heart for education. He goes to school only because he is compelled to do so. Likewise, although we may read the Word of God, perhaps out of a sense of duty, we may not have a heart for the Word. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJt0fe--Viqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h">A Divided Heart</h2><p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRA6Iagmj2TX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> Another problem you may have in your heart is the problem of a divided heart. It is possible that your heart is divided into two or three parts, perhaps even more. This may especially be true of young people. A young person may love <span class="pg" data-page-id="691" id="691">[691]</span> many different things. This causes the heart to be divided. One thing occupies one part of the heart, and something else occupies another part. Suppose a young man has a heart for his studies, but also has a heart for a particular form of worldly entertainment. This will cause his heart to be divided. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTNwiBVRcNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> If a person’s heart is divided into two parts, one part for something good and another part for something evil, the evil tendency will always prevail. This seems to be a natural law or principle. In his heart a person may have two opposite intentions; he may intend both to lie and to tell the truth. The evil intention, that of telling a lie, will prevail over the good intention, that of telling the truth. Whenever our heart is divided, reading the Word of God will not help us. If we come to the Bible halfheartedly or with a divided heart, we shall not receive blessing from the Word. Whenever we come to the Bible, we must come with a whole heart and with a single heart. It is not profitable to read the Word of God in a halfhearted way. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5cR5lOcEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer">A Lack of Heart</h2><p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FbRF3mSwPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> Another problem of the heart in relation to the Word is that of not having any heart at all for the Word. We have pointed out the problem of not using or exercising our heart in reading the Word. However, there is a difference between this and not having a heart for the Word. There are some people who seem to have no heart at all. Inwardly, they are like dead wood. No matter how much such a person may read the Bible, he will not receive any blessing from his reading, for he lacks the function through which to comprehend what the Bible is saying. He simply has no function of heart in reading the Word. This is a very serious problem. When many Christians come to the Bible, they are like dead wood, without a heart. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr86__Rre4pcJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s">Coverings, Hindrances, and Frustrations</h2><p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjmYMNXNmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> Another problem with the heart is related to things that cover you, separate you from the Lord, or frustrate your <span class="pg" data-page-id="692" id="692">[692]</span> contact with the Lord. In reading the Word of God, you may cry out to the Lord and be desperate to receive something from the Lord. However, there may be hindrances or frustrations within you. There may be a certain sin that besets, captures, and possesses you. On the one hand, you love the Word of God. On the other hand, a certain sin may lie hidden in your heart, and you may not be willing for the Lord to deal with it. Such a hidden sin will prevent you from receiving blessing from the Word. Suppose, for example, someone has offended you, and you are not willing to forgive this offense. You may not consider that your unwillingness to forgive is a sin, but it is in fact a sin. You may hide this sin, or other kinds of sins, from man, and you may even attempt to conceal it from the Lord. If you come to the Bible with such a sin hidden within you, you will not be able to receive anything from the Word, even though you have a heart for the Word. If you have a tendency toward something which does not please the Lord and at the same time desire to come to the Word, you will not be blessed by reading the Word of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD_pDasbW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> We know from our experience that at times we struggle with the Lord, perhaps over the issue of consecration. We may not be willing to consecrate ourselves, to be subdued by the Lord, or to be convinced by Him. We may insist on holding to our opinion regarding a particular matter. Even though the Lord speaks to us again and again, we still are not willing to be convinced, because His speaking is contrary to our opinion. We cling to our concept and insist on it. Such an insistence is a veil that covers our heart. Do you think that you can receive help from the Word if your heart is covered in this way? To be sure, reading the Word when you are in such a condition will not be a help to you. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzINPOzQ_D9BVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> If we want to receive blessing from the Word of God, we must first deal with our heart and turn to the Lord absolutely and with our whole heart. We also need to deal with anything in our heart that is negative or that causes separation between us and the Lord. If we deal with our heart and with the negative things between us and the Lord, our <span class="pg" data-page-id="693" id="693">[693]</span> condition is likely to be normal. Then it is very possible that we shall receive help from the Word. </p>

<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTk5uAArQmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> This message continues the “day” aspect of the law. In fact, we may even say that we have come to the “noontime,” for, as we shall see, through the law as God’s living word we have the enjoyment of God Himself as our portion. To be sure, this is the highlight of all the blessings we receive through the living Word of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8656azCM5Y6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34516" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> the psalmist uses different expressions to refer to the law. One of these terms is the testimony, or the testimonies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34517" data-verses="Psalms 119:88">vv. 88</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34518" data-verses="Psalms 119:24">24</span>). The law is God’s testimony. As the testimony of God, the law describes God and presents a picture of what He is like. A law is always a testimony, or expression, of the person who makes the law. For example, if bank robbers could make laws, they would no doubt legalize the robbing of banks. A law is always the expression of the legislator. In like manner, the law given by God on Mount Horeb is the testimony of God as the divine Law-giver. God’s law is His portrait. As the expression of God, the law shows us what kind of God He is. This is the reason the word testimony is used in the Old Testament with respect to the law. The Ten Commandments inscribed on two stone tablets were called the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34519" data-verses="Exodus 34:29">Exo. 34:29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34520" data-verses="Exodus 31:18">31:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34521" data-verses="Exodus 32:15">32:15</span>). Because these tablets were placed in the ark, the ark was called the ark of testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34522" data-verses="Exodus 25:22">Exo. 25:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34523" data-verses="Exodus 30:6">30:6</span>). Furthermore, <span class="pg" data-page-id="706" id="706">[706]</span> the tabernacle in which the ark was located was called the tabernacle of testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34524" data-verses="Exodus 38:21">Exo. 38:21</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIAPKIXxO3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> Other terms for the law in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34525" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> are statutes, ordinances, precepts, and judgments. The law truly judges us. Apart from God’s law, there is no yardstick of judgment. The law tells what is right and what is wrong, what is of God and what is not of God, what is for God and what is not for God. As the law judges, it measures and exposes. It also accuses and excuses, justifies and condemns. For all these reasons, the law is called God’s judgments. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbAMPtgBpHhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34526" data-verses="Psalms 119:91">verse 91</span>, the law is also called God’s ordinances. Ordinances are regulations or rules. For example, in the city where you live there are ordinances about where you may park your car and where parking is prohibited. Every city has its own ordinances. Likewise, the law is the divine ordinances. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0SWycJmx8Wf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34527" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> the law is also called God’s statutes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34528" data-verses="Psalms 119:12">v. 12</span>). Each of the commandments is a statute. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZTyj8-EcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> The psalmist also referred to the law as God’s precepts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34529" data-verses="Psalms 119:4">v. 4</span>). A precept is instruction given as a proverb in which people are taught concerning their behavior. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-fOwcLwIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> In the foregoing message we covered ten aspects of the blessing received by the loving seekers of God through His law as His living word: enlightenment, life supply, watering, restoration, deliverance, strength, comfort, nourishment, upholding, and safeguard. The first blessing we receive is that of enlightenment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34530" data-verses="Psalms 119:130">119:130</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34531" data-verses="Psalms 119:105">105</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34532" data-verses="Psalms 19:8">19:8b</span>). If our condition is right when we come to the Word of God, we shall enter into a realm of light and thus be enlightened. Then we shall receive the life supply and experience the watering. These three items go together and bring in restoration, deliverance, strength, comfort, nourishment, upholding, and safeguard. This sequence is according to spiritual experience, not according to doctrine. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cB1vOVTYwWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> We praise the Lord that the word spoken by God has been written and printed. The invention of the printing press was for the distribution of the Word of God. Millions of copies of the Scriptures have been printed and circulated around the <span class="pg" data-page-id="707" id="707">[707]</span> world. Although the Bible is so available, whether or not we receive blessing from it depends on our condition. As we have pointed out, we need a proper heart. If our heart is proper when we come to the Word, we shall enter into the realm of light. God is light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34533" data-verses="1John 1:5">1 John 1:5</span>), and this light is consolidated in the Word. This means that the Word of God is the embodiment of God as the divine light. This is the reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34534" data-verses="Psalms 119:130">verse 130</span> says, “The entrance of thy words giveth light.” Because the Word of God is light, the entrance, the opening, of the Word gives light. Actually, there should be no need for us to say that we receive light from the Bible concerning certain points. We should enter into a sphere of light and not just receive a particular kind of light. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTk5uAE5AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> Light brings in life. However, it is also true that life brings light. It is difficult to say which comes first, life or light. According to the Old Testament, light comes before life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34535" data-verses="Genesis 1:3">Gen. 1:3</span>). But according to the New Testament, life precedes light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34536" data-verses="John 1:4">John 1:4</span>). Although we may not be able to say accurately which comes first in our experience, we know that as long as we have the one, we also have the other. We have light and life, and then the life supply becomes water. As we have seen, light, life, and watering bring in many other blessings. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8656azFfZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ">THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD<br/>AS OUR PORTION</h2><p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIAPKIRi-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> These ten blessings will lead us to the highest blessing of all—the enjoyment of God Himself as our portion. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34537" data-verses="Psalms 119:57">119:57</span> the psalmist declares, “Thou art my portion, O Jehovah” (Heb.). When we have God as our portion, we have not only light, life, water, and all the benefits these bring us, but we have the very God Himself. Some may think that the Old Testament saints did not enjoy God as their portion. But the writer of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34538" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> says definitely that the Lord was his portion. Because the psalmist kept God’s word, God could be his portion. It is a very great matter to have God as our portion. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbAMPtgI6HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> God can be our portion because He is real and not a <span class="pg" data-page-id="708" id="708">[708]</span> superstition. If God had not been a reality to him, the psalmist could not have testified that the Lord was his portion. Everything superstitious is vain, unreal, and not at all substantial. How could something vain and unreal be our portion? It would be impossible. When the psalmist declared that God was his portion, he was enjoying and touching something very real. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0SWycJuisWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> In order for God to be our portion, He must also be very practical, present, enjoyable, and available. How could something become our portion if it were not near and available? And how could something be our portion if it were not enjoyable and practical? For many Jews, Moslems, and even Christians, God is far away. To them, God is not practical, present, enjoyable, and available. In their experience, they do not have Him as their portion. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYLADIJCazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> I can testify from personal experience that my God truly has become my portion. I have never seen Him with my eyes or touched Him with my hands, but in my inner being I enjoy Him all day long. Some may claim that this is merely a psychological phenomenon. However, psychological phenomena usually do not last very long; yet the enjoyment of God as our portion is long-lasting. God is ever the same; He does not change. This One who is real, practical, present, enjoyable, and available is my portion. I am sure that you also have had some experience of God as your portion. Even though your experience may be limited, you cannot deny that to you God is real, practical, present, enjoyable, and available. He truly is our portion. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l5C0gAMMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> We all face problems in life. From years of experience I have found that there is just one antidote to our problems. This antidote is all-inclusive and very effective—it is God Himself. He alone is the answer to our problems and the cure for all our troubles. If we do not allow God to come into our situation, life will be nothing more than an empty dream. Without God, all our dreams first become problems, then troubles, and ultimately turn into death. But if we take the Lord and apply Him to our situation, things will be different. We shall be able to testify that our portion is not this <span class="pg" data-page-id="709" id="709">[709]</span> matter or that thing. Our portion is not a good marriage, a high position, a large bank account, or a piece of real estate. Our portion is the Lord Himself. Because He is living, real, and practical, we can taste Him and enjoy Him. </p>

<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQayQNs3iwajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> After several messages on the “day” aspect of the law, we come in this message to the “night” aspect. According to the divine revelation in the Bible, whenever God comes to have contact with man, there are always two aspects of this contact. The reason for this is that such contact involves both God and man. Before the fall of man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34568" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>, man was wholly on God’s side. He had been created in God’s image and after God’s likeness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34569" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> we see that God created the plants and animals each according to its own kind. Although man, of course, is not divine, he was created according to God’s kind, not according to his own kind, as was the case with everything else. Man was made in the image of God and after the likeness of God. This indicates that man was created according to God’s kind. Therefore, at the time of creation, man was on God’s side and was one with Him. Concerning God and man at the time of creation, there were not two kinds. Because man was made according to God’s kind, there was just one kind, and that was God’s kind. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755X3-DLku9jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34570" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> we see that in his subtlety the serpent injected his evil thought into the mind of the woman. The question he asked her and the words he spoke to her were the embodiment of the Devil’s thought. When Eve spoke to the serpent and responded to his question, she received <span class="pg" data-page-id="718" id="718">[718]</span> devilish concepts into her mind. This means that before she ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, satanic thoughts had already been planted into her. Man’s fall took place first through the acceptance of devilish thoughts, then through the physical act of eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge. First the human mind took sides with the Devil; then man acted according to the Devil’s thought and word by eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge. As a result, the nature of the Devil entered into man’s flesh. The consequence of this was that the devilish thought and nature separated man from God so that man was no longer on God’s side or after His kind. As the Bible indicates, every sinner is a serpent, the very offspring of vipers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34571" data-verses="Matthew 23:33">Matt. 23:33</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34572" data-verses="1John 3:10">1 John 3:10</span> we are even told that fallen people are children of the Devil. Fallen man has become a creature after the Devil’s kind. He is no longer after God’s kind. For this reason, in rebuking Peter the Lord Jesus called him Satan. Furthermore, one day the Lord Jesus plainly said that Judas, the one who would betray Him, was a devil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34573" data-verses="John 6:70">John 6:70</span>). The fact that the Lord could call one of His intimate disciples Satan and refer to a false disciple as a devil indicates that fallen man is now according to Satan’s kind. The fall has caused man to become another kind of creature, a creature no longer according to God’s kind. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGpDzw8TOPzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> At the time God brought the children of Israel to Mount Sinai, were they after God’s kind or after Satan’s kind? We should be careful in answering this question. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34574" data-verses="Exodus 19:3">Exodus 19:3</span> God refers to both the house of Jacob and the children of Israel. The house of Jacob and the children of Israel are two different kinds of people. (This distinction cannot be explained away as an instance of the parallelism common to Hebrew poetry.) In the eyes of God the house of Jacob is different from the children of Israel. According to whose kind was Jacob? Was he according to God’s kind? Surely Jacob, a supplanter, was according to the Devil’s kind, for he was a fallen person. Like us, Jacob was after the Devil’s kind. Hence, the expression “the house of Jacob” is the title of the people who are after the Devil’s kind. The expression “the <span class="pg" data-page-id="719" id="719">[719]</span> children of Israel” denotes a people who are according to God’s kind. They are descendants of Israel, the prince of God. Now we can see that when God brought the Israelites to Mount Sinai, they were in His eyes two peoples: the house of Jacob according to Satan’s kind and the children of Israel according to God’s kind. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJgvvKPZPAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> It is rather difficult to say how many were among the house of Jacob and how many belonged to the children of Israel. Moses, no doubt, was among the children of Israel, for he was according to God’s kind. It is not easy to say where Aaron was. Aaron seemed to be among both the house of Jacob and the children of Israel. Our experience is often the same. In the morning, we may be numbered among the children of Israel, but at the end of a day’s work, we may act like a Jacob. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34575" data-verses="Exodus 24:1">24:1</span>, Aaron, along with Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, was told to come up unto the Lord. However, Aaron later showed that he did not have the ability to overcome the opinion of the religious congregation when they said to him, “Up, make us gods, which shall go before us” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34576" data-verses="Exodus 32:1">32:1</span>). The congregation is rightly called a religious congregation because they had the intention to worship something, even though that thing was an idol. Aaron knew that the people’s request was sinful, but he was too timid to withstand them. In a very real sense, Aaron was on both sides, sometimes on God’s side and at other times, on the side of the religious congregation. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqH9hR-pyUXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> Like Moses, Joshua belonged absolutely on God’s side. He was very faithful and stood with God as a person after His kind. However, it is difficult to locate where Joshua was physically with respect to Moses at the time the law was decreed on the mount. No clear word is given regarding Joshua’s whereabouts. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjlaMNXPmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> From the time of the fall, man’s condition determines whether or not God’s contact with him will be in the “day” or in the “night.” The deciding factor is on man’s side, not on God’s side. On God’s side there is no night, for God is light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34577" data-verses="1John 1:5">1 John 1:5</span>). It is impossible for there to be night with God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34578" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> speaks first of evening and then of morning. Night <span class="pg" data-page-id="720" id="720">[720]</span> is referred to first because of the fall of the original creation in the age before Adam when Satan and certain angels and other creatures rebelled against God. This fall brought in night (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34579" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">Gen. 1:2</span>). When God came in to restore the fallen creation, His work of restoration brought in day once again. The fact that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34580" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> speaks of evening and morning indicates that night is related to the original fall in the universe, whereas day is related to God’s work of restoration. Therefore, in the restored universe day follows night. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD8rDasZW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> Our Christian experience also goes from night to day. We were brought out of the night and entered into the day. Because of our fallen condition, we were in the night. But God’s salvation has brought us a new day. When we received this salvation, we entered into day. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzINMMzQ8DdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> Many Christians have a hope that their spiritual experience will be an everlasting day. But not until we are in the New Jerusalem will there be no more night, only day. Concerning the New Jerusalem it is said, “Night shall not be there” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34581" data-verses="Revelation 21:25">Rev. 21:25</span>). In our present experience, our night is usually longer than our day. In other words, we may be “down” more than we are “up.” In our experience night and day will continue until we enter the New Jerusalem, which will be illumined by the glory of God and where there will be no more night. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqf_x6EcD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> To repeat, whether God’s contact with us is in the “day” aspect or in the “night” aspect depends on our condition. With Moses, there was no darkness. Therefore, in his case the giving of the law was wholly a matter in the “day.” The same was true concerning the function of the law. However, for those in the house of Jacob, both the giving of the law and the function of the law were in the negative aspect, in the aspect of “night.” </p>

<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnC_geRvvPiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> Not many Christians realize that concerning both the giving of the law and the function of the law, there are two aspects, the “day” aspect and the “night” aspect. Nevertheless, such a truth lies hidden in the Bible. If we get into the depths of the truth in the Bible and consider it in the light of our spiritual experience, we shall see that there are these two aspects related to the giving of the law and its function. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJC-S0zc6oTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> Christians should never have the attitude that the law of God is not good. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34649" data-verses="Romans 7:12">Romans 7:12</span> Paul says, “So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34650" data-verses="Romans 7:14">Romans 7:14</span> he goes so far as to say, “The law is spiritual.” The law is both good and also spiritual. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-DwqxcM3paQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> Paul’s use of the adjective “spiritual” with respect to the law indicates that the law is related to God the Spirit. Because the law is something of God and out of God and because it belongs to God, who is Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34651" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span>), the law is the same as God in essence and in nature. Whatever proceeds out from God must be the same in substance as He is. The word “spiritual” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34652" data-verses="Romans 7:14">Romans 7:14</span> points to this substance. Certain things are very good, but because their substance is not of the Spirit, they cannot be called spiritual. Because the law comes out of God and is the same as God in substance, it is both good and also spiritual. <span class="pg" data-page-id="730" id="730">[730]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNFe_IHKJKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> Because God is both the source of the law and its substance, the law is very uplifted in its nature. We should never regard the law as something that is not good or spiritual. In speaking of the law in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34653" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>, Paul was careful. He emphatically declared that the law is holy and also spiritual. The law remains good and spiritual no matter whether we are good or evil, spiritual or unspiritual. If we are evil, the law is still good. If we are not spiritual, the law is nonetheless spiritual. No matter what we are, the law is good and also spiritual. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf4u-roiD2ndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> Although in itself the law is always good and spiritual, to us the decree of the law may be either positive or negative, either “day” or “night,” depending on our spiritual condition. To one kind of person, the decree of the law may be very negative. But to another kind of person, it may be altogether positive. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYLAjIJAazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> These two aspects of the decree of the law, the “day” aspect and the “night” aspect can be seen on the same occasion—the giving of the law on the mountain. The mountain where the law was given was called both Mount Horeb and Mount Sinai. To Moses on the mountaintop, the mountain was Mount Horeb, the mountain of God. But to the people at the bottom of the mountain, it was Mount Sinai. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l5CUgAOMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> I am sure Moses never forgot that wonderful experience with the Lord on the mountaintop. When Peter, James, and John were with the Lord Jesus on the mount of transfiguration, they saw the Lord transfigured, but they were not transfigured themselves. But when Moses was on the mountaintop with the Lord, he himself was actually transfigured. When he came down after spending forty days with God on the mountain, the skin of his face was shining with the element of God which had been transfused into him. The light that radiated from Moses’ face was in fact the light of God Himself. If this light was not God’s light, then what other kind of light was it? For Moses, the mountain on which the law was given was not Mount Sinai; it was Mount Horeb, the mountain of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBmvz7yNFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> When Moses was on the mountaintop being infused with <span class="pg" data-page-id="731" id="731">[731]</span> God, he was mingled with God. Just as Peter did not forget his experience on the mount of transfiguration but referred to it when he was old (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34654" data-verses="2Peter 1:17">2 Pet. 1:17</span>), so Moses could not forget his experience on the mountain of God, where he beheld the Lord, was infused with His element, and was mingled with Him. In their ignorance and blindness, some people today oppose the truth that believers can be mingled with God. According to them, the teaching that we can be mingled with God is heretical. But if Moses had not been mingled with God, how shall we account for the shining of his face? What caused his face to shine so that the people could not bear to look at it? Moses was infused with God Himself and experienced a kind of transfiguration. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_BisTj9qck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> In the Bible we are told of only two people whose faces shone: Christ on the mount of transfiguration and Moses when he came down from Mount Horeb. When Christ was on the mount of transfiguration, His face was shining like the sun (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34655" data-verses="Matthew 17:2">Matt. 17:2</span>). As we have pointed out, when Moses came down from the mountain after beholding the Lord for so many days, the skin of his face also was shining. Eventually, the believers will shine as the sun. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34656" data-verses="Matthew 13:43">Matthew 13:43</span> the Lord Jesus said that “the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.” If we wish to be those who shine as the sun, we need to be a Moses on the mountaintop beholding the Lord and being infused with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GiYV6fsZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> Whether in our experience the decree of the law is positive or negative, “day” or “night,” depends on our condition, not on the law itself. If we are a Moses on the mountaintop, the decree of the law for us will be a wonderful experience. But if we are like the people trembling at the bottom of the mountain, the decree of the law in our experience will be dreadful and terrifying. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQayQ9szxAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> At the time the law was given, three categories of people were involved: Moses, and perhaps Joshua also, on the mountaintop, the people at the foot of the mountain, and those who were on the mountain worshipping afar off. As one on the mountaintop, Moses experienced God’s transfusion and infusion. The ones who were on the mountain, <span class="pg" data-page-id="732" id="732">[732]</span> neither at the top or the bottom, worshipped afar off, and those at the foot of the mountain trembled. Where are you in your experience? Are you at the bottom of the mountain trembling, on the mountain worshipping afar off, or on the top of the mountain being infused with the element of God? </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755X3-zLj99jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> To Moses and possibly to Joshua as well, the decree of the law was a wonderful experience. But to those at the bottom of the mountain, it was very frightening. This was the reason they trembled with fear. The vital point here is that whether the giving of the law is positive or negative, “day” or “night,” to us is determined by our condition, not by the law. If our condition is positive, the giving of the law will also be positive. But if our condition is negative, the decree of the law will be negative. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGpDDw6AePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> The same principle applies in reading the Bible. In our experience, the Bible may be either a book of “day” or of “night.” Many hold to the superstition that the Bible affords only good things for those who read it. According to this superstitious belief, whenever a person comes to the Scriptures, he will receive something positive. However, many come to the Bible and do not receive any benefit whatever. Furthermore, both believers and unbelievers alike have actually been slain spiritually by the Bible. Those who take the Bible as a book of dead letters will be killed by it. This has been the experience of many Christians, including a good number of pastors and Bible students. People are slain by the Word not because there is anything wrong with the Bible, but because there is something wrong with those who read it. Like the law, the Bible is good and also spiritual. As a gift from God, the Bible cannot be wrong in any way. However, to those whose spiritual condition is a “night” the Bible becomes a book of “night.” Once again we see that whether the Bible is a book of “day” or “night” to us in our experience is not determined by the Bible itself: it is determined by our spiritual condition. </p>

<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5fTZlKP0fCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> In my experience with the Lord I have learned a particular secret, and I would like to share it with you. The secret is whenever you find that the Bible tells you to do a certain thing, do not say, “Lord, I’ll do this. I just ask You to help me do it.” Instead, tell Him that you love Him, but that you are not able to fulfill His requirements. For instance, a young person may say, “Lord, I love you. The Bible tells me to honor my parents. Lord, I must confess that I cannot honor them. But I do love You and Your Word. I want to stay with You according to Your Word. Lord, I just want to be here with You.” Then the Lord will assure that young person that although he cannot honor his parents, He Himself will do this in him. We should simply say Amen to the Word of God. Then the Lord will do in us what we could never do ourselves. How marvelous! </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FbSHXmVjPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> This matter of telling the Lord that we love Him and His Word, but that we are not able to do what the Bible says surely is not a natural concept or a religious concept. However, it is according to God’s economy. Should the Lord require you to preach the gospel of the kingdom to the uttermost part of the earth, you should say, “Lord, I love You, and I love the Word. But I must tell You, Lord, that I am not able to preach the gospel to the person next door, much less to the uttermost part of the earth. But, Lord, I love You, and I want to stay with You.” If you say this to the Lord, you will have <span class="pg" data-page-id="744" id="744">[744]</span> the conviction deep within that even though you cannot fulfill this requirement, the Lord will do it in you and through you. As long as you love the Lord and His Word and as long as you stay with Him, He will do in you what you cannot do yourself. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr86_8TLe-6MJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> When I read the Bible many years ago, I said, “Amen! I’ll do whatever the Bible says.” Now when I read the Word, I say, “Lord, I love the Word and I love You. But, Lord, You know that I can’t do what the Bible says. Now I know that whatever You tell me to do, You will do for me. I know what is on Your heart. You have no intention for me to do anything. Although You tell me to do certain things, Your desire is that You do these things in me. You simply want me to love You and to stay with You. The more I stay with You, love You, and tell You that I cannot do anything, the happier You are.” </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjlasNedGh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> The Lord likes us to tell Him again and again that we cannot do what the Word tells us to do. He wants to keep us with Him. The more we stay with Him and tell Him that we are not able to do anything, the happier He is. God wants us to stay with Him so that we, like Moses on the mountaintop, may be infused with Himself. This is what God desires today. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD8rjakLm2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> God has not only given us the Ten Commandments and certain ordinances and precepts; He has given us the entire Bible. Shall we presume to think that we can do all the Bible says? Certainly not. Instead, we should stay with the Lord and tell Him again and again that we love Him and His Word, but that we cannot do what the Bible says. The Lord is eager to do for us and in us what we cannot do ourselves. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zBuhavySXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> We have pointed out that the decree of the law differs according to the different categories of people. When the law was given, Moses was on the mountaintop experiencing the divine infusion, some were on the mountain afar off worshipping, and the majority were at the bottom of the mountain trembling. Neither those who worshipped afar off nor those at the foot of the mountain could fulfill God’s purpose. God’s purpose could be fulfilled only through Moses, <span class="pg" data-page-id="745" id="745">[745]</span> the one who experienced His infusion. Only he could fulfill the desire of God’s heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgbD4vSIvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> Because Moses was infused with God, he became a man of God, even a God-man. Just as iron can be infused with fire and mingled with it, so Moses was infused with God and mingled with Him. We are like the iron, and God is like the fire. Just as iron can be burned by fire until it glows, God wants us to be burned by Him, infused and mingled with Him, until we shine with Him. This is God’s intention. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjI1AKixxs7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> No matter where we may be reading in the Bible, we need to say, “Lord, I love You, and I want to stay with You. Lord, I receive whatever You say. But, Lord, I cannot do it. However, now I know Your strategy. You will do everything for me and in me.” If a brother tries in himself to love his wife, he will not be able to do so. But if, instead of trying to love her, he stays with the Lord and is infused with Him, he will love his wife automatically. She may be greatly surprised at the love her husband has for her. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wN1sG3K-vl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> I can testify that many times I have made up my mind to do certain things, only to fail miserably. But at other times I simply opened to the Lord to be infused with Him. Then I found that the Lord would do in me what I was not able to do myself. This is what God is seeking today. </p>

<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_bTx128TNcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> At this point we need to say a word concerning the function of the law on the negative side. The law exposes our sinfulness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34682" data-verses="Romans 5:13">Rom. 5:13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34683" data-verses="Romans 5:20">20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34684" data-verses="Romans 4:15">4:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34685" data-verses="Romans 7:7-8">7:7-8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34686" data-verses="Romans 7:11">11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34687" data-verses="Romans 7:13">13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34688" data-verses="Galatians 3:19">Gal. 3:19</span>). The Bible also has the function of exposing our condition. Apart from the law, we cannot know sin. But when the law comes, sin is exposed. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vVpTdrhE6d_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52">B. To Subdue Sinners</h2><p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4fqYI07WCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> If we are right with God, the law will not only expose us, but will also subdue us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34689" data-verses="Romans 3:19">Rom. 3:19</span>). When we are exposed and subdued, we shall become humble before God. We shall <span class="pg" data-page-id="746" id="746">[746]</span> say to Him, “Lord, I am sinful and unclean. How I thank You, Lord, for Your redemption. I love You, and I thank You for the blood which cleanses me and for Your Spirit which purifies me.” By nature we all are proud. If we did not have the law, we would never realize how sinful we are, and we would never be subdued. We are proud before others and even before God. But the law, and the Bible as well, shuts our mouths. We have no way to justify ourselves or to vindicate ourselves. </p>

Once we have been brought to Christ, we shall receive the blessing. After we have been enlightened, subdued, guarded, and brought to Christ, we may receive Christ as our life. Then if we stay with Christ, we may enjoy Him as our person. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3l3SJ-3kyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> Christ is the embodiment of God. When we have Him, we have God. When we stay with Him, we stay with God. When we are one with Him, we are one with God. If we remain one with Christ, spontaneously we shall live Christ. We shall be able to say with Paul, “To me to live is Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34691" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Phil. 1:21</span>). This living of Christ is equal to shining forth God as a result of being infused with Him. When the element of God is transfused into us, our face shines with God, and when we stay with Christ, we spontaneously live Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9pB-vO3Q9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> It is not God’s intention in giving commandments that we should do things for Him. The concept of doing things for God is a fallen human concept. It is also a religious concept. After God created man, God did not charge him to do many things for Him. Instead, He gave man a commandment related to his eating. God placed the man created by Him in front of the tree of life and warned him not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God’s intention was that man would eat of the tree of life and thereby receive God into him. </p>

<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2URRw3T4UeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> God’s eternal purpose is to work Himself into us as our life so that we may take Him as our person, live Him, and express Him. This is the desire of God’s heart; it is also the focal point of the Bible. In order to fulfill this purpose, God created man in His image and after His likeness. God’s intention in creating man was that man would receive God into him and take Him as his life and everything to him. For this reason, after God created man, He placed him in front of the tree of life. This indicates that God wanted man to eat of this tree, which is a symbol of God Himself as life. To eat of the tree of life is to take God into us as our life and life supply. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zBvRaogyXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> The tree of life is seen both in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34717" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34718" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span>. From eternity to eternity, God’s intention is for man to partake of this tree. Our destiny in eternity future is to eat the tree of life and thereby to live God and express Him. This is God’s eternal intention. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgbCIvUafwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34719" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> the serpent tempted man to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. As a result of eating of this tree, man became fallen. Instead of partaking of the tree of life, man ate of the tree of knowledge. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjI1B6i4js7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> The principle of life is dependence, whereas the principle of knowledge is independence. For example, after a student of mathematics learns all his instructor has to teach him, he can be independent of his teacher. Because the student knows mathematics for himself, it is no longer <span class="pg" data-page-id="754" id="754">[754]</span> necessary for him to depend on this teacher. Knowledge leads to independence, but life requires constant dependence. We can never afford to become independent with respect to the means of life. In fact, the more life we have, the more dependent we are. To maintain our physical life we must breathe, drink, and eat. If we want to stay alive, we cannot graduate from breathing, drinking, and eating. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wN1t23Cs_l3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> If man had not fallen, man’s living would not be independent from God, but man would continually take God in and live by Him. Man would depend on God, and there would be no separation between God and man. Man would be able to receive God directly as life, live by Him, and even live Him. What a wonderful situation that would be! </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJgu_KGLvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> At the time of man’s fall a wedge was driven between man and God, a wedge that caused a separation between them. The knowledge of good and evil made man independent from God. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqH9gB-hgkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> Another consequence of eating of the tree of knowledge is that man tries to do things for God on his own. In a sense, man realizes that he has displeased God. Because of this realization, he makes up his mind to do something to please God. With fallen human beings, therefore, there are two striking characteristics: independence and efforts on his own to please God. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2ByM4YAr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> God is not willing to give up His original purpose for man. In order to deal with man in his fallen situation, God gives commandments to him. By giving man commandments, God seems to be saying, “You want to do something to please Me, but you don’t realize how fallen you are, how incapable you are, and how far you are from Me. The very fact that you try to please Me proves that you don’t know where you are. Let Me now give you some commandments to test you, to prove whether or not you can fulfill them.” </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7ThIuYWYe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> The law decreed by God functions in at least three ways. First, the law portrays God and defines Him. As God’s testimony, the law is actually a portrait of God; it shows us what He is like. All the commandments given by God both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament reveal who <span class="pg" data-page-id="755" id="755">[755]</span> God is and what He is. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34720" data-verses="Leviticus 19:2">Leviticus 19:2</span> gives this commandment: “Ye shall be holy: for I Jehovah your God am holy” (lit.). The Lord Jesus issued an even higher commandment: “You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34721" data-verses="Matthew 5:48">Matt. 5:48</span>). In both cases the principle is the same: the law presents a picture of God. According to the law He has given, God is perfect, holy, and righteous; He is a God of love and of light. His law presents a picture of what He is. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9Igp5lJRHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> The second function of the law is that of exposing us. This function is presented in a full way in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34722" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34723" data-verses="Romans 7:7">Romans 7:7</span> Paul declares, “But I had not known sin except through the law; for I had not known coveting except the law had said, You shall not covet.” Until the law came, sin was dormant. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34724" data-verses="Romans 7:8">Romans 7:8</span> Paul says that “without law sin is dead.” Then in the next verse he goes on to say that “when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.” Using the law as a knife, sin put Paul to death. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34725" data-verses="Romans 7:11">verse 11</span> Paul tells us that sin killed him by taking occasion through the commandment. Thus, in his experience Paul found that the commandment was death unto him. God used the law to expose him. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGr95BwYfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> A third function of the law is the function of subduing us. After we are exposed, we need to be subdued. Once the law has subdued us, it can then bring us to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPX8XkquJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> The rich young man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34726" data-verses="Matthew 19:1">Matthew 19</span> was defeated in his contact with the Lord; however, he was not subdued. This was the reason he went away sorrowful. If he had been subdued and had said, “Lord Jesus, I cannot fulfill Your requirement to sell all I have and give to the poor,” the Lord would have told him, “Since you cannot do it, simply let Me fulfill this requirement for you.” The Lord wants to come into us, be our life, and fulfill every requirement for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnC_h-Rr8fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34727" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">Philippians 2:12</span> Paul says, “So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only as in my presence, but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.” We need to be subdued by Paul’s word and admit that we simply cannot work out our own salvation. Then we shall appreciate Paul’s word in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="756" id="756">[756]</span> following verse: “For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.” Although we cannot work out our own salvation, God is operating in us both the willing and the working. This enables us to work out our salvation according to God’s operating within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJC_y00MaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> After we have been subdued by the law and tell the Lord that we cannot fulfill His requirements, that we simply cannot be holy as God is or perfect as the Father is, the Lord will say, “Simply open and receive Me. Let Me come into you and fulfill these requirements for you. I want to be your holiness and your perfection.” We cannot be holy, but we can be sanctified. Likewise, we cannot be perfect, but we can be perfected. God’s desire is to come into us to be our life and our person. In this way, He becomes one with us, and we become one with Him. Then as He lives in us, we live Him. This is the basic principle of the divine revelation in the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-Dwqw8Mx5qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> It is true that both in the Old Testament and in the New, God commands His people to do many things. In addition to the Ten Commandments, there are numerous precepts, ordinances, and regulations. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34728" data-verses="Exodus 21:1">Chapters twenty-one through twenty-three</span> of Exodus are filled with such ordinances, precepts, and regulations. All these are used by God to expose and subdue the children of Israel. His intention is to use the law to portray Himself and then to expose us and subdue us so that we may open to Him and allow Him to come into us to be our life and everything to us. Then He will live in us, and we shall live Him. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34755" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:7">2 Corinthians 3:7</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34756" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:9">9</span> Paul used all the key words in the title of this message, “The Veil over the Glory of the Ministry of Condemnation and Death.” The words glory and ministry are positive; however, the words veil, condemnation, and death are negative. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34757" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span> Paul speaks first of the ministry of death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34758" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:7">v. 7</span>) and then of the ministry of condemnation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34759" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:9">v. 9</span>). These certainly are extraordinary expressions. Although these terms are in the Bible, not all Christians are familiar with them. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2njzkhOlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS">THE GLORY OF THE MINISTRY<br/>OF CONDEMNATION AND DEATH</h2><p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3l2yJ7lUyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34760" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span>, the ministry of Moses was a ministry of condemnation and death. Paul’s ministry, however, was a ministry of righteousness and of the Spirit. I wonder if Moses would have been happy with the way Paul contrasted the ministry of righteousness and of the Spirit with the ministry of condemnation and death. In writing <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34761" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span>, Paul used “much boldness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34762" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:12">v. 12</span>). He was bold to point out that his ministry was greater in glory than that of Moses. Paul says, “For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34763" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:9">v. 9</span>). We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34764" data-verses="Exodus 34:29-35">Exodus 34:29-35</span> that the skin of Moses’ face shone. Although Paul’s face did not shine in this way, he experienced an inward shining, a shining from within his spirit. With Moses and <span class="pg" data-page-id="766" id="766">[766]</span> Paul there were two different kinds of shining: the outward shining upon the face and the inward shining from the spirit. Today all who believe in Christ may have the inward shining. But one day, at the time of the Lord’s coming, we shall be transfigured and shall have the outward shining also. At that time, not only our face but also our whole body will shine. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9pAevElQ9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> Some systematic theologians do not appreciate the value of Moses’ ministry. Even though Paul speaks of the ministry of Moses as a ministry of condemnation and death, he acknowledges that there was glory with this ministry. More than three thousand years ago, there was a man on earth whose face shone with the glory of God. This is a very significant matter, and we should never despise it. Along with Paul, we need to recognize that the ministry of condemnation and death was truly glorious. We should not dispute the fact that this glory was wonderful and excellent. It is possible to say in a rather careless way that we, the New Testament believers, have the inward glory, whereas Moses had merely the outward glory. But some Christians actually have a glory only in doctrine, not in their experience. They may claim to be New Testament believers with the inward glory, but where is this glory actually? Experientially speaking, they may have very little glory. Yes, Moses’ glory was outward, but we should still appreciate it. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC43Xo-Ppy81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34765" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span> may be regarded as an exposition of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34766" data-verses="Exodus 34:29-35">Exodus 34:29-35</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34767" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Exodus 34</span> we are simply told that the skin of Moses’ face shone, not that glory was shining from the face of Moses. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34768" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span> Paul interprets <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34769" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Exodus 34</span> by saying that the shining on Moses’ face was the glory of the ministry of condemnation and death. Apart from the interpretation set forth by Paul, we would not have the wisdom to speak of the shining face of Moses as the glory of the ministry. Furthermore, we would not have the boldness to say that the ministry of condemnation and death was glorious. But because Paul had been enlightened of the Lord, he was bold to speak plainly of these things. The shining on Moses’ face was the glory of a <span class="pg" data-page-id="767" id="767">[767]</span> ministry which had been given by God and established by Him. Moses had a ministry, and that ministry was glorious. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4fqZo07UCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS">THE VEIL OVER THE GLORY<br/>OF THE MINISTRY</h2><p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP43Zf6BP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> At this point we need to ask why Moses’ ministry of glory became a ministry of condemnation and death. In itself Moses’ ministry was not a ministry of condemnation and death. It became such a ministry because the people were in darkness and because their hearts were hardened. The book of Exodus says at least thirteen times that Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, or that Pharaoh hardened his heart. When the children of Israel were at the foot of the mountain of God, their hearts were the same as the heart of Pharaoh. This means that the hearts of the people had become hard. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2njzkmclAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> The kind of person you are is determined by the kind of heart you have. If you have an evil heart, you are an evil person. But if you have a good heart, you are a good person. Likewise, if your heart is full of hate, you will be a hateful person. But if your heart is full of love, you will be a loving person. When they were at Mount Sinai to receive the law, the children of Israel had a hardened heart. As a result, the ministry of glory became for them a ministry of condemnation and death. It definitely was not God’s intention to condemn the people or to bring them into death. But because the people were hard and blind in their heart, like Pharaoh in Egypt, the ministry of glory became a ministry of condemnation and even of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3l2yJ93EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> The principle is the same in reading the Bible. Do not think that it is impossible for the Bible to condemn you or kill you. If your heart is hard as you read the Bible, the Bible will become to you a book of condemnation and death. Do not hold the superstitious concept that people always receive blessing in reading the Bible. This simply is not true. Whether the Bible is a ministry of life or of death, of righteousness or of condemnation, depends on our heart. If our heart is soft, the Bible will be a blessing. But if our heart is hard, the Bible will be a book of condemnation and death, <span class="pg" data-page-id="768" id="768">[768]</span> even as the ministry of Moses became a ministry of condemnation and death to the children of Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9pAevN2w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> In the foregoing message we pointed out the aspect of the law as killing letters. In this message we are concerned with the matter of the veil over the glory of the ministry of condemnation and death. Concerning the “night” aspect of the law, the two main things are the killing and the veiling. The letters kill, and the veil covers. The law was given, but there was a veil over it. In like manner, in our experience there may also be a veil over the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC43Xo-H6C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> When Moses came down from the mountain, he did not know that the skin of his face shone. It was the people who saw that “the skin of Moses’ face shone.” Eventually, Moses himself came to realize this. We are told that he later put a veil on his face. However, the strange thing is that Moses did not put this veil on until after he had finished speaking with the people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34770" data-verses="Exodus 34:33">v. 33</span>, lit.). Before he came down from the mountain to speak with the people, Moses did not have a veil on. He did not even know that his face shone. Only after he had spoken to the people did he put a veil on his face. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34771" data-verses="Exodus 34:34">Verse 34</span> says, “But when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out” (lit.). Then we read that when Moses spoke to the children of Israel, he “put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34772" data-verses="Exodus 34:35">v. 35</span>). Thus, when Moses spoke with the people, he put on the veil. But when he spoke with God, he removed it. </p>

<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB5NIyfMwqRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> The book of Genesis can be summarized by two phrases: God’s creation and man’s fall. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34801" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span> says, “In the beginning God created....” Genesis concludes in the following way: “So Joseph...was put in a coffin in Egypt” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34802" data-verses="Genesis 50:26">50:26</span>). Thus, Genesis opens with a word about God’s creation and concludes with a word about Joseph put in a coffin in Egypt. God’s creation, of course, is very positive, but man’s fall is extremely negative. Therefore, the summary of Genesis involves the positive matter of God’s creation and the negative matter of man’s fall. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZTzD85W8JlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> We may say that the book of Exodus has one main point: God’s redemption and salvation. Because man had fallen, God came in to redeem and save. Fallen man needs both God’s redemption and His salvation. Exodus reveals the all-inclusive salvation of God, a salvation which includes God’s redemption. According to the book of Exodus, God first redeemed His people and then saved them. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-fPQcNi4s4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> Christians may not realize that the entire book of Exodus concerns God’s salvation. According to many, the last sixteen chapters of Exodus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34803" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">chapters twenty-five through forty</span>, are not related to God’s salvation, but are concerned with the vision and the building of the tabernacle. However, the building of the tabernacle as God’s dwelling place is also part of God’s all-inclusive salvation. This means that the salvation of God revealed in the book of Exodus begins with redemption and continues through the building of God’s habitation, the tabernacle. If we have been redeemed and experience God’s salvation to a certain extent but are not in <span class="pg" data-page-id="780" id="780">[780]</span> God’s building, God’s dwelling place, then we have not yet participated in God’s salvation in full. God’s complete salvation includes the building up of His redeemed people to become His habitation on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cB1vP1TRiWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> Among the millions of today’s Christians, the genuinely redeemed and saved people, not many enjoy the experience of having become God’s habitation. In the experience of some, the book of Exodus seems to have only twelve or fourteen chapters. They have experienced the redemption of the Passover lamb and perhaps have been delivered from Egypt, but they do not experience the building of God’s dwelling place. Actually, many of today’s Christians are still in Egypt, the world. Although they have experienced God’s redemption, they have not crossed the Red Sea. This means that they have not been saved from the world and from enslavement to Pharaoh. Some Christians have crossed the Red Sea and have been saved from the world, but they have not progressed in their experience to the mount of God and they have not become God’s tabernacle. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTk4OAMrQmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> In Exodus, Mount Sinai is called the mount of God. Here God’s redeemed people were brought into direct fellowship with Him. This is a great matter. It was not until twenty-five centuries after the creation of man that the children of Israel were brought into such fellowship with God. Prior to that time, there were no people on earth who had face-to-face fellowship with God. On the one hand, at Mount Sinai the people were brought into fellowship with God; on the other hand, God came down to speak with them. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34804" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">Genesis 11</span> God came down not to have fellowship with the people, but to judge them. In Exodus God came down not to judge, but to have fellowship with His people. At Mount Sinai the children of Israel were feasting with God. This also is included in God’s all-inclusive salvation revealed in Exodus. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJC_S00OaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> At Mount Sinai God did not meet with His people merely for a day. Rather, the people remained with Him there for many months (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34805" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">Exo. 19:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34806" data-verses="Exodus 40:2">40:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34807" data-verses="Exodus 40:17">17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34808" data-verses="Numbers 10:11-13">Num. 10:11-13</span>). God considered His redeemed people His “personal possession” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34809" data-verses="Exodus 19:5">19:5</span>, lit.), His precious treasure. Because His people were so <span class="pg" data-page-id="781" id="781">[781]</span> precious to Him, He came down to visit them. According to the Old Testament, God’s meeting with His people lasted more than a thousand years. It did not end until the glory of the Lord departed from the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34810" data-verses="Ezekiel 10:18">Ezek. 10:18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-DwqwcMx7qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> With this message we come to the ordinances of the law. The law in the Old Testament not only includes the Ten Commandments, but also includes many ordinances. These ordinances are found in the remaining chapters of Exodus, in the entire book of Leviticus, and in parts of Numbers and Deuteronomy. Many Christians think that the law includes only the Ten Commandments. This was my concept when I was young. However, I was bothered by the fact that in the Bible Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy are all regarded as part of the law. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34811" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span>, the law includes ordinances as well as commandments. This indicates that the law has two sections: the Ten Commandments and all the ordinances. Thus, it is a mistake to consider only the Ten Commandments to be the law. No, the law includes much more than just the Ten Commandments. If we see that the law includes the ordinances as well as the commandments, we shall then find it easy to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34812" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNFe-IHDbKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> The ordinances are a supplementary part of the law and add details to the Ten Commandments. It is correct to regard the Ten Commandments as the main section of the law. But this main section needs to be supplemented and spelled out in detail. In the second part of Exodus and in Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy we have the supplement to the law and the details of the law. In this message, the first on the ordinances of the law, we shall consider the ordinances concerning the worship of God. In other messages we shall consider ordinances concerning the relationships between people. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf4u_roqRmndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34813" data-verses="Exodus 20:22-26">20:22-26</span> God unveils to His redeemed people how they should worship Him. This had not been revealed previously, not even to Abraham, one who was called the friend of God. Only after His people had been brought into face-to-face fellowship with Him at the mountain of God did God reveal <span class="pg" data-page-id="782" id="782">[782]</span> the way for them to worship Him. If we get into the depths of these verses, we shall see that they give us the main points of how we should worship God. The revelation here is in keeping with that found not only in the rest of the Old Testament, but also in the New Testament. Here we have a revelation of the cross and of Christ. Furthermore, according to these verses, we see that both man’s work and man’s way are excluded. These verses even refer to idols of gold and silver. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoaUM7WzqNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34814" data-verses="Exodus 20:22">Exodus 20:22</span> says, “And Jehovah said unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven” (lit.). Here we see that God spoke to His people from heaven. Even this verse is related to the worship of God, for here we have an indication that the God whom we worship is the living and the speaking God. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVLiXNEKXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34815" data-verses="Exodus 20:23">Verse 23</span> continues, “Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.” Here we have a supplement to the first two commandments and also details related to these commandments. In the first two of the commandments we are told not to have any gods other than God and also not to make idols. The phrase “with me” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34816" data-verses="Exodus 20:23">verse 23</span> is significant. It indicates that the people were not to worship God and yet have another god with Him. This would be like a woman who had one husband, but also had another man with him. Just as a woman should have only one husband, so the children of Israel were to have only the Lord as their unique God. </p>

<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l5DEgEc8l6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> In this message I am burdened to give a further word concerning the worship of God from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34847" data-verses="Exodus 20:24-26">20:24-26</span>. Worship is a very crucial matter in man’s relationship with God. Throughout the thousands of years of human history, thoughtful people have considered the matter of the worship of God. When such people ponder the universe with the sun, moon, and stars, and the earth with all the plants, living creatures, and mankind, they realize that there must be a God, an almighty Being. Then they begin to wonder how this God is to be worshipped. Considerations such as these have given rise to different religions. The religions invented by man have their source in the considerations of thoughtful people. By studying nature man has discovered certain things. Furthermore, as a result of his observations and discoveries, he has made inferences. Religion is the result of a thoughtful study of nature with man’s philosophical inferences. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBmuj71fFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> According to the Bible, however, God does not allow man to devise his own way to worship Him. God does not give any ground to man’s natural concept or thought. He does not permit fallen man to worship Him according to inferences drawn from the study of nature. God condemns man’s natural inferences as related to worship. On the contrary, in the Bible God reveals how man is to worship Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_BitDj74Mk5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> In Genesis we do not have a clear revelation concerning the way to worship God. Exodus contains a much fuller revelation of this. After God brought His chosen and redeemed <span class="pg" data-page-id="792" id="792">[792]</span> people to His mountain, He came to have fellowship with them. We have pointed out that the decree of the law on the mountain was given in an atmosphere of courtship. This means that at Mount Sinai God was courting His people. After giving them the Ten Commandments, the governing principles of the entire law of God, God went on to issue a number of ordinances. Between the giving of the Ten Commandments and the decreeing of the ordinances, God spoke to the people concerning the way they should worship Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34848" data-verses="Exodus 20:22-26">20:22-26</span>). In the short span of five verses, the main points related to the worship of God are covered. As we shall see, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34849" data-verses="Exodus 20:24-26">20:24-26</span> both man’s work and man’s way are utterly rejected by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GiZF6W_5KauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> When I was young, I regarded these verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34850" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exodus 20</span> as primitive and uncultured. It seemed to me that no skill or inventiveness was required to make an altar of earth or stone. Even a child can do this. Even the most primitive, uncultured, and uneducated people can build such an altar for the worship of God. I could not understand why God was willing to accept such a primitive altar. Man’s way is not to build this kind of altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQayRts7iwajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> According to the history of civilization, man likes to build towers and skyscrapers. Those who live in New York, Paris, and Tokyo may boast respectively of the Empire State Building, the Eiffel Tower, and the Tokyo Tower. The thought of fallen man is to build up something high. The first occurrence of this was at Babel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34851" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">Gen. 11</span>), where the people sought to build not only a city, but also a tower of which they could boast. This indicates that tall buildings are constructed so that man is able to boast. The more cultured people are, the more tall buildings they build. But God’s way is to have an altar without steps. Man’s way is to build up something with as many steps as possible. As far as the worship of God is concerned, God gives no room for man’s skill, ability, inventiveness, wisdom, labor, or power. On the contrary, the altar God requires must be something which, in the eyes of man, is primitive and uncultured. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m5ALICMoyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> Concerning the worship of God, the tendency of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="793" id="793">[793]</span> natural man is to use his own power and wisdom. People use their wisdom to make plans and use their power, including whatever skills and abilities they possess, to carry out their plans. But according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34852" data-verses="Exodus 20:24-26">20:24-26</span>, God does not recognize man’s wisdom and power. Even though Moses had been educated in Egypt and was familiar with all the aspects of Egyptian culture, being “trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34853" data-verses="Acts 7:22">Acts 7:22</span>), God did not allow him to use his wisdom to build an altar for the worship of God. Moses was not the only one among God’s people familiar with Egyptian culture. All those who came out of Egypt with him had been born there and knew the Egyptian way of doing things. All of them had received a strong infusion of Egyptian culture. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34854" data-verses="Exodus 20:24-26">20:24-26</span> God gave them a clear word concerning worship, telling them to make an altar either of earth or of stones. They were not to use hewn stones, and they were not to build an altar so high that it required steps in order to reach it. God seemed to be saying to the people, “I do not care for human work or invention, and I do not care for man’s way or concept. For the altar, you must use the materials created by Me. I care only for what I have created, not for man’s work or man’s way.” </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh63_qmOovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> In theology a distinction is often made between natural religion and revealed religion. Many regard Christianity as a revealed religion, a religion which has its source in God’s revelation, and regard all other religions as natural. However, it is very sad that even in Christianity today there is a great emphasis on man’s work and man’s way. In any Christian group it is easy to detect man’s work and way, but it is difficult to find something which is purely according to God’s revelation. Consider the situation in Catholicism and Protestantism. How much there is of man’s invention, skill, ability, plans, ways, power, and wisdom! Even the sermons given are filled with such things. Where can you hear a sermon that is pure and limited to the revelation of the Bible? Most sermons have many elements of culture, often mixed with the truth of the Word. A few years ago some of us heard a message given by the pope. This message was a <span class="pg" data-page-id="794" id="794">[794]</span> mixture of biblical truth and human thought. Man’s work, way, power, and wisdom have thoroughly saturated today’s Christianity. As a result, it has become a mixture of God’s revelation and natural religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-2M8UYe189qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> If we read carefully <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34855" data-verses="Exodus 20:24-26">20:24-26</span>, we shall see that God’s revelation leaves no room for man’s work or way. God does not give even the slightest amount of space to man’s power, ability, skill, strength, wisdom, or plans. In like manner, in the Lord’s recovery we do not give place to man’s work or way. I have the assurance that if someone would conduct research on the recovery, he would find that we do not give ground to man’s work or man’s way. Some may wonder if the practice of pray-reading the Word is a way invented by man. However, pray-reading is not an invention of man; on the contrary, it is according to the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB5NIifIi6RI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> In today’s Christianity it is easy to see man’s work and way. This can be observed even without studying things closely. Among most Christians, man’s work and man’s way are very evident. Some who have been strongly influenced by man’s work and way consider the meetings of the churches in the Lord’s recovery to be primitive and uncultured. Their attitude toward us is that we are ignorant and have no knowledge or education. When a certain person visited me a few years ago, he asked how many among us have doctoral degrees. He boasted that among those associated with him there were more than one hundred with Ph.D. degrees. This is one illustration of the fact that in today’s Christianity much attention is given to human power, ability, skill, and wisdom. The consequence of this is that God is actually set aside. People may claim to worship God, but in their worship the work and way of man have actually caused them to put God aside. When the Roman Empire embraced Christianity, many elements of culture were brought into the so-called Catholic Church. Constantine the Great opened the way for many pagan things to be brought in. This caused Christianity to become a melting pot of different elements of man’s culture. Furthermore, the Catholic Church introduced many such things into their worship. For this reason, in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="795" id="795">[795]</span> worship practiced in Catholicism there are many human inventions. Catholicism is filled with human ways, works, power, and wisdom. However, it is abominable in the eyes of God to bring anything man-made into the worship of God. </p>

<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7ThLuYSKO1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34874" data-verses="Exodus 21:1">chapters twenty-one through twenty-three</span> of Exodus many ordinances are covered. In this message we shall consider the first of the ordinances concerning man’s relationship with others (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34875" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-6">21:1-6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9Igq5lOCnJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> In the Old Testament an ordinance either adds details to the Ten Commandments or supplements them. Nearly all the ordinances in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34876" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-23">Exodus 21 through 23</span> are concerned with man. But, as we have pointed out, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34877" data-verses="Exodus 20:22-26">20:22-26</span> there is an ordinance concerning the worship of God. This is a special ordinance, an extraordinary ordinance, for it is concerned not with man’s relationship with others, but with man’s relationship with God. There is no doubt that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34878" data-verses="Exodus 20:22-26">20:22-26</span> is a supplement to the second and third commandments and also adds details to these commandments. The second and third commandments do not tell us how to worship God. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34879" data-verses="Exodus 20:22-26">20:22-26</span> we see that we must worship God through an altar and with the sacrifices. The altar typifies the cross, and the sacrifices typify Christ. Hence, we must worship God through the cross and with Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGr-5B2LvVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> The sequence of the ordinances concerning man’s relationship with man is unusual in that the first ordinance concerns the relationship between a master and his slave. If we had written this part of the Bible, we probably would have put some other ordinance first, perhaps an ordinance concerning children and parents. We may have followed Paul’s sequence in Ephesians and Colossians and spoken of wives, husbands, children, and parents before slaves and <span class="pg" data-page-id="804" id="804">[804]</span> masters. It is indeed strange and very significant that of all the ordinances in these three chapters the first mentioned is that related to slavery. It is important to know the reason for this. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPX_Xkj9JfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ">THE SPIRIT OF THE FIRST ORDINANCE</h2><p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnC_i-RjvPiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> One of the best ways to understand the Bible is to endeavor to touch the spirit of the particular portion of the Word under consideration. What, we may ask, is the spirit of this ordinance in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34880" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-6">21:1-6</span>? It is correct to say that the spirit of this ordinance is love and also obedience. However, something else is involved, something which is a prerequisite of both love and obedience. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTNziRVRdNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> How can we love and be obedient? Help in answering this question is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34881" data-verses="Philippians 2:7-8">Philippians 2:7 and 8</span>. According to Paul’s word here, the Lord Jesus “emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.” First the Lord Jesus emptied Himself and then He humbled Himself. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34882" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">Philippians 2</span> Christ is presented to us as our pattern. As a pattern to the believers, He is a model of a proper human life. This pattern is not of one who occupies a high position in society; on the contrary, it is the pattern of one who is a slave. Even though Christ was equal with God and had the highest rank in the universe, He became a person on the lowest level of society. The very One who was equal with God not only became a man, but became a slave. In this He emptied Himself and humbled Himself. Those who would follow this pattern must also empty themselves and humble themselves. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5fRplOdEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> Keeping the ordinances of the law has much to do with taking the form of a slave. There is not one nation where all the people are willing to keep the law. Instead, many try to escape the law and even hire attorneys to help them do this. Because people are not willing to keep laws, when God gave the Ten Commandments, He spoke of the people loving Him and said that He would show mercy to those who love Him <span class="pg" data-page-id="805" id="805">[805]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34883" data-verses="Exodus 20:6">20:6</span>). This indicates that we cannot keep God’s commandments unless we love God. In like manner, there is a prerequisite to keeping all the detailed ordinances of the law—the willingness to be a slave. The only one who can fulfill all the ordinances of the law is one who is willing to be a slave. A slave does not stand on his own rights. He only knows to serve and to sacrifice, not to care for his own interests. A slave must always be concerned for others. This slave spirit is the spirit of the ordinances in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34884" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-23">Exodus 21 through 23</span>. Those who intend to keep the ordinances described in these chapters must first become slaves. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FbSFnmSxPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> This principle also applies to our living as Christians today. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34885" data-verses="Galatians 5:13">Galatians 5:13</span> says that we were called to freedom, but should serve one another as slaves through love. If we would be a good husband or wife or a good parent, we must be a slave. This means that a father must be a slave in relation to his children. Only then can he be a good father. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr86_8R7e4ocJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> To be a slave is to have the spirit of sacrifice. A slave is one who does not stand on his own rights; instead, he is always willing to serve others and sacrifice himself for them. If everyone in the United States had such a spirit, life in this country would be heaven on earth. There would be no need for attorneys, for no one would be fighting for his rights. The reason people fight with one another is that everyone cares for his own interests and rights. How different things would be if all men became slaves sacrificing and serving instead of fighting for their own interests! </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjlYcNXOmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> Do you sense the spirit underlying the ordinances in these chapters? The spirit that pervades all these ordinances is the spirit of service and of sacrifice. If the Israelites did not have this kind of spirit, there would be no way for them to keep the ordinances. However, they could keep the ordinances if they were willing to empty themselves, humble themselves, lower themselves, sacrifice their rights, and serve others. Then they would live for others and not for themselves. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD8pTasYW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> Both the Lord Jesus and the apostle Paul emphasized the fact that the keeping of the law is a matter of love. When <span class="pg" data-page-id="806" id="806">[806]</span> the Lord was asked which commandment was the greatest, He replied, “You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart, and from your whole soul, and from your whole mind, and from your whole strength” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34886" data-verses="Mark 12:30">Mark 12:30</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34887" data-verses="Romans 13:8">Romans 13:8</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34888" data-verses="Romans 13:10">10</span> Paul says, “He who loves another has fulfilled the law,” for “love is the fulfillment of the law.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34889" data-verses="Galatians 5:14">Galatians 5:14</span> Paul declares, “For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” How can we love others if we maintain our rank and fight for our rights and interests? To be like this shows that we love only ourselves. Then instead of keeping the ordinances of the law, we shall break them all. In order to keep the ordinances, we must empty ourselves, humble ourselves, take the lowest position, and regard ourselves as nothing. We must be willing to sacrifice our position, rights, and interests. This is to be a slave, a person who knows nothing except to serve others and to sacrifice himself for them. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzINMOjQ8CdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> If we discern the spirit behind all the ordinances in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34890" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-23">Exodus 21 through 23</span>, we shall understand why at the very beginning of these chapters there is an emphasis on slavery. God’s ordinances certainly are altogether different from man’s laws. In human law there is no place for humility and love. But the prerequisite of fulfilling the divine ordinances is emptying ourselves, humbling ourselves, not claiming anything for ourselves, and sacrificing ourselves to serve others. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqf9h6EdD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK">A TYPE OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36WD1LLPBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> Many Bible teachers have pointed out that the slave in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34891" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-6">21:1-6</span> is a type of the Lord Jesus. I agree. The slave in these verses does typify Christ. The Lord Jesus lived on earth as a slave. Thus, as the standard of the highest human living, the Lord in His living fulfilled the requirement of the first ordinance of the law concerning our relationship with others. </p>

<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVLhnNAZne1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> The Bible is a very sweet book. We have a sweet taste when we read many portions of the Word. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34916" data-verses="Psalms 119:103">Psalm 119:103</span> declares, “How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth.” However, when we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34917" data-verses="Exodus 21:7">Exodus 21:7—23:19</span>, we may not sense any sweetness. Did this portion of Exodus taste sweet to you when you read it last? If we get into the depths of these chapters and touch the spirit in which they were written, we shall realize that this part of the Word also is very sweet. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJt3fe-5Hiqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> The Bible was not only inspired by the Spirit; it was also written with a particular spirit. This is especially true of the laws and ordinances in the Old Testament. Even with respect to the secular law of a country, people speak of the spirit of the law. How much more is there a certain spirit in the law and ordinances decreed by God! If we touch the depths of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34918" data-verses="Exodus 21:7">21:7—23:19</span>, we shall have a sweet taste. However, although it is easy to touch the body of the Word outwardly, it is often rather difficult to touch the spirit of the Bible inwardly. To read only the letters in black and white is to touch the body of the Word. We must exercise to go deeper and touch the spirit of the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRA5IaggxmTX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> The Bible as a whole was revealed by God according to His economy. Nevertheless, especially in the Old Testament, the divine revelation is given according to the situation of the people. For example, when I read the book of Exodus as a young man, I was troubled by the fact that God in His law did not abolish slavery. I also wondered why slaves did not have rights equal to the free. I asked why the law given <span class="pg" data-page-id="814" id="814">[814]</span> by God and all the ordinances decreed by God still allowed such inequalities to exist. We are told that if an ox killed a slave, the owner had to pay a smaller amount than if the ox killed a free man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34919" data-verses="Exodus 21:28-32">21:28-32</span>). This indicates that a slave did not have the same rights as a free man. Some may even doubt that these ordinances were revealed by God. They may regard them simply as Moses’ own ideas. However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34920" data-verses="Exodus 21:1">21:1</span> clearly says, “Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them” (lit.). All the ordinances in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34921" data-verses="Exodus 21:1">chapters twenty-one through twenty-three</span> were written by Moses according to God’s dictation. Thus, they were not devised according to Moses’ concept. For this reason, we cannot dismiss them by saying that they are nothing more than an ancient way of thinking. But since these ordinances were dictated by God, we may ask why something like slavery was allowed to exist. Questions like this remind us that it is not easy to understand the Bible. In order to know the Word, we need to know God’s heart and also God’s economy, purpose, and plan. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTNziBVYPtP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> The laws and ordinances of God in the Bible are written in a way that is very different from the way man-made laws are written. Often men try to write something classical when they compose a law. An attorney may even try to produce a classical writing on a particular case. However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34922" data-verses="Exodus 21:1">chapters twenty-one through twenty-three</span> of Exodus were not composed in a classical way. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5fR5lGP0fCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> As we read these chapters, it may seem to us that the ordinances are arranged in a rather unusual order. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34923" data-verses="Exodus 21:15">21:15</span> says that he who smites his father or mother shall be put to death. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34924" data-verses="Exodus 21:16">verse 16</span> says that he who steals a person shall be put to death. But then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34925" data-verses="Exodus 21:17">verse 17</span> speaks about one cursing his father or mother and being put to death for this offense. Why are <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34926" data-verses="Exodus 21:15">verses 15</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34927" data-verses="Exodus 21:17">17</span> not put together? Why does <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34928" data-verses="Exodus 21:16">verse 16</span> come between them? If we had composed this chapter, we probably would have put <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34929" data-verses="Exodus 21:15">verses 15</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34930" data-verses="Exodus 21:17">17</span> together, followed by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34931" data-verses="Exodus 21:16">verse 16</span>. But God inserted a verse having nothing to do with parents in between verses which speak respectively of smiting one’s parents and of cursing <span class="pg" data-page-id="815" id="815">[815]</span> one’s parents. To be sure, the arrangement here serves a definite divine purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8654KzFeZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> We believe that every word of the Bible is God-breathed. If we would appreciate <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34932" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-23">Exodus 21 through 23</span> adequately, we must touch the depth of these chapters to sense the spirit in which they were written. As we shall see, the spirit here is wonderful. No man-made laws of any nation or society have been written with the spirit found here. How sweet is the spirit in which God’s ordinances were composed! </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIANaIRj-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> We have seen that the first six verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34933" data-verses="Exodus 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span>, the first of the many ordinances concerning man’s relationship with others, are related to slavery. The composition of these verses is not classical. Furthermore, according to the human concept, these verses are not altogether logical in their arrangement. But the spirit that pervades them is very sweet. We have pointed out that when given the opportunity to be free, a slave could say, “I love my master, my wife, and my children. I do not want to go out free.” What a sweet spirit! In His Word God does not care for a classical style of writing. Instead, He cares for sweetness of spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbAMN9gI7HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34934" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-6">21:1-6</span> we can see the spirit of a slave, the love of a slave, the obedience of a slave, and also the life of a slave. How sweet is this ordinance concerning slavery! I do not believe that we could sense any sweetness in any man-made law we might read. However, if we consider carefully all the ordinances in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34935" data-verses="Exodus 21:1">chapters twenty-one through twenty-three</span>, we shall realize that every ordinance is sweet. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34936" data-verses="Exodus 23:4">23:4</span> says, “If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.” Instead of wanting to return an animal belonging to an enemy, we may be tempted to praise the Lord for exercising His judgment on our enemy and for vindicating us. But according to this ordinance, an Israelite was to return a lost ox or ass to his enemy. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34937" data-verses="Exodus 23:5">23:5</span>, if an Israelite saw a heavily laden donkey belonging to a person who hated him, the Israelite was to stop what he was doing and relieve the animal of its burden. He could not excuse himself by saying that he was too busy. He had to lay aside his own <span class="pg" data-page-id="816" id="816">[816]</span> burden to release from its burden an ass belonging to a person who hated him. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0SWwMJujsWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> The New Testament teaches us to love our enemies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="34938" data-verses="Matthew 5:44">Matt. 5:44</span>). But this commandment is not as sweet in spirit as the ordinances in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34939" data-verses="Exodus 23:4-5">23:4 and 5</span>. According to these ordinances, on the one hand an Israelite had to return an ox or ass belonging to his enemy; on the other hand, he had to work with the very one who hated him to release that one’s donkey from its heavy burden. In these matters an Israelite had to face his enemy personally. I know of brothers who have given financial help to those who hated them, but they did not visit those persons. However, according to the ordinances here, an Israelite had to personally return the lost animal to his enemy. The more we consider these ordinances, the more we realize the sweetness of the spirit in which they were written. Who would ever think that the laws of any nation would be composed in such a spirit? God’s laws were not written according to man’s wisdom. On the contrary, they were dictated by God in His wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYLCTIJBazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> As we have indicated, the ordinances in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34940" data-verses="Exodus 21:1">chapters twenty-one through twenty-three</span>, as well as the ordinance concerning worship at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34941" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">chapter twenty</span>, all provide details to the Ten Commandments. Certain details are added to each of the commandments. We have already pointed out that the ordinance concerning the worship of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="34942" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">chapter twenty</span> adds details to the second and third commandments. Furthermore, some of the ordinances are a supplement to the commandments.

<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36XB1LMfhsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> Because the Bible is the divine revelation, we should not read it in a superficial way. We need to get into the depths of the Word in order to mine its riches. Many precious things are found beneath the surface of the Word. Because such vast riches are found beneath the surface, it is not sufficient merely to know the Bible in black and white letters. We must go deep into the Word and discover the precious things under the surface. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0OzB27ZoJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> I come from a country which produces the highest quality crystal. One day a friend showed me a large, unsightly stone ball. He told me that hidden within this stone ball was a beautiful crystal. Then he cut into the ball and revealed the crystal concealed within it. We may compare the Bible to this ball of stone which contains precious things. In every chapter of Scripture there can be found things of great value. In particular, many “diamonds” are hidden beneath the surface of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35000" data-verses="Exodus 21:1">chapters twenty-one through twenty-three</span> of Exodus. My burden in this message and in the message following is to mine these “diamonds” and present them to the Lord’s people. </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneHNNd7CHHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> The title of this message uses three important words: implications, indications, and significances. These words point to three aspects of the riches found in the depths of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35001" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-23">Exodus 21 through 23</span>. In certain verses we find implications; in <span class="pg" data-page-id="828" id="828">[828]</span> others, indications; and in still others, significances. If we would mine the riches in these chapters, we need to consider the implications, indications, and significances of the ordinances of the law presented here. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2VQRw7T4UeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN">I. THE DECREE OF THE LAW WITH ALL<br/>ITS ORDINANCES INDICATING MAN’S FALL<br/>AND MAN’S LIVING IN THE FALL</h2><p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36XB1LLNBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> In the decree of the law with its ordinances there is a clear indication that man is fallen and is living in the fall. The expression “fall” or “living in the fall” cannot be found. However, words like pollution, nakedness, slavery, murder, stealing, coveting, and witch strongly point both to man’s fall and to his living in the fall. The ordinances related to these matters describe the fallen condition of man. If man had not fallen, or if man were not living in a fallen condition, there would be no need for God to give such ordinances. If we pay attention to words like pollution, murder, lying, and idols, we may be enlightened to see that man’s living in the fall is indicated. In this way we get into the depths of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0OzB29LYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> The law with its ordinances was not given to people who were innocent and pure. On the contrary, the law was given to fallen mankind, to people living in a fallen condition. Because of man’s fall and because of man’s living in the fall, there was the need for God to come in to decree the law with its ordinances. </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneHNNd7LVHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> In these chapters we have a picture of man’s fallen condition. How very dark is the scene! Here we have pollution, nakedness, witchcraft, idolatry, adultery, fornication, and covetousness. Behind all these negative things is Satan. Although Satan is not mentioned in these chapters by name, his existence behind the negative things is implied. Demons also are mentioned by implication. Witchcraft involves contact with demons. If there were no demons, there would be no witchcraft. Hence, the one word “witch” implies the existence of witchcraft and demons. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2VQRwzBoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> The ordinances in these chapters also imply the fact of <span class="pg" data-page-id="829" id="829">[829]</span> indwelling sin. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35002" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> Paul speaks of covetousness, of coveting of every kind. Although Paul hated the sin of covetousness, he had no way to overcome it. The more he loathed it, the more active it became. Paul could even say, “So now it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35003" data-verses="Romans 7:17">Rom. 7:17</span>). The very mention of coveting implies indwelling sin. Furthermore, this indwelling sin is actually Satan with his lusts. We admit that there is no explicit reference to Satan in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35004" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-23">Exodus 21 through 23</span>. However, in the light of the full revelation of the holy Scriptures, we can trace the word coveting to indwelling sin, and indwelling sin to Satan. Therefore, hidden beneath coveting is indwelling sin, and concealed under indwelling sin is Satan, the Devil, with his lusts. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zAuRavzSXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> These chapters not only indicate the fact of indwelling sin, but also speak of outward sins. Murder, lying, and stealing certainly are sins. Therefore, as in the book of Romans, we have both indwelling sin implied and outward sins clearly indicated. In Romans Paul deals with sins in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35005" data-verses="Romans 1:1">chapters one through three</span>, and he deals with indwelling sin in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35006" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapters five through eight</span>. On the negative side, the ordinances in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35007" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-23">Exodus 21 through 23</span> point to Satan, demons, indwelling sin, and outward sins. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgaDIvSJvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> The picture of the items on the negative side in these chapters is dark and bleak. But the picture of the items on the positive side is bright and glorious. First, these chapters reveal that God is kind and gracious, full of care for us. As the most gracious One, He cares for widows, orphans, and strangers. By preparing cities of refuge into which a person may flee, He even provides for the mistake of one who kills another unintentionally. Furthermore, God also provides that one who sells himself into slavery may be released after six years. All these ordinances show us that God is kind, gracious, and loving and that He cares for mankind. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjI0A6ixws7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> In these chapters we also have a picture of Christ. Christ is typified by the sacrifices (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35008" data-verses="Exodus 20:24-26">20:24-26</span>). With Christ, through Christ, and by Christ, we can worship God. Christ is not for angels; He is for fallen man. The ordinance concerning <span class="pg" data-page-id="830" id="830">[830]</span> worshipping God through the altar and with the sacrifices was intended for fallen man, not for angels. Christ is also signified by the city of refuge and by the Sabbath. Furthermore, even the sabbatical year is a picture of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wN0s23K_vl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> The cross of Christ is signified by the altar in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35009" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">chapter twenty</span>. This altar is not for angels; it is for fallen man. Angels are spectators, those who observe Christ and the cross, but we are partakers, those who enjoy Christ and the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4dpq-JgqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> In these chapters we have, on the negative side, Satan, demons, indwelling sin, and outward sins. On the positive side, we have God, Christ, and the cross. We also have redemption, forgiveness, justification, and reconciliation implied. To be sure, no man-made law has such implications, indications, and significances. As students of the Word of God, we need to consider all the implications, indications, and significances found in these chapters. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj9D53HIF4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP">II. THE ALTAR AND THE SACRIFICES<br/>FOR THE WORSHIP OF GOD INDICATING<br/>THAT FALLEN MAN NEEDS TO BE REDEEMED,<br/>TERMINATED, AND REPLACED BY CHRIST<br/>WITH HIS CROSS</h2><p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_bSxF2_StcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35010" data-verses="Exodus 20:24-26">20:24-26</span>, the altar and sacrifices for the worship of God indicate that in order to worship God fallen man must be redeemed, terminated, and replaced. God requires man to worship Him through an altar and with a sacrifice. Furthermore, the one who worships God must lay his hand on the head of the sacrifice and thereby identify himself with it. The sacrifice is then slain and placed on the altar. All this indicates that fallen man needs to be redeemed, terminated, and replaced by Christ with His cross. We are redeemed and terminated by the altar, but we are replaced by Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vVoTtriFad_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> Before we can appreciate these matters, we need to realize that we are sinners and that our case is hopeless. If we were not sinners, there would have been no need for God to redeem us. If we were not hopeless, God would not require <span class="pg" data-page-id="831" id="831">[831]</span> that we be terminated and replaced. The fact that we need redemption, termination, and replacement indicates that we are sinful and hopeless. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4frY404UiuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> It is wrong for a brother to expect his wife to improve. Instead, recognizing that her case is hopeless, he should see that her need is not improvement but termination. We are all a hopeless case, and the case of our husband or wife is likewise hopeless. Thus, we should accept the fact that we need to be terminated. But after we are terminated by the cross, we enter into resurrection, and in resurrection we can be replaced by Christ. A brother needs to see that his wife cannot improve, but she can be replaced by Christ. Likewise, a sister should not pray that the Lord will improve her husband. This kind of prayer is merely ethical and religious. Rather, she should pray, “Lord, I thank You that You are able to replace my husband with Yourself. I ask You, Lord, to replace him.” </p>

<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_bSxV27ANcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> It is easy to read and understand the ordinances in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35053" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-23">Exodus 21 through 23</span> merely according to the letters in black and white. However, it is difficult to get into the depths of this portion of the Word and dig out the riches of the implications, indications, and significances of the ordinances of the law. In order to mine the riches hidden beneath the surface in these chapters, we should take certain crucial words and then trace their implications. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35054" data-verses="Exodus 22:18">22:18</span> says, “Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.” The crucial word in this verse is witch. If we trace the significance of this word and consider its implications, we shall see that this involves witchcraft and that witchcraft is related to demons. Hence, the single word witch implies the existence of both witchcraft and demons. By tracing the implications of a word in this way, we can get into the depths of the Bible and mine the precious things concealed beneath the surface. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vVoT9rnXqd_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> Other important words in these chapters are murder and coveting. We can trace murder to the Devil, the founder, the source, of murder, the one who was “a murderer from the beginning” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35055" data-verses="John 8:44">John 8:44</span>). In the same principle, the word coveting leads us to the matter of indwelling sin described by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35056" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35057" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> we see that indwelling sin refers primarily to the lust of coveting. Moreover, if we consider carefully the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35058" data-verses="Exodus 23:1">Exodus 23:1</span> about raising a false <span class="pg" data-page-id="840" id="840">[840]</span> report, we shall see that this involves lying and that lying can be traced to Satan, the father of lies. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4frYo0yGiuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> On the positive side, we need to consider the implications, indications, and significances of the words altar and sacrifice in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35059" data-verses="Exodus 20:24-25">20:24 and 25</span>. The altar points to the cross, and the sacrifices signify Christ. In like manner, the unleavened bread and the feasts also typify the riches of Christ. Actually, to trace the implications, indications, and significances of the crucial words in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35060" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-23">Exodus 21 through 23</span> is not a matter of allegorizing the Bible. Rather, it is to open the way for us to dig into the Word and to see what riches are found under the surface. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP52ZfyT_8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> A number of Bible teachers have pointed out that the altar typifies the cross and that the sacrifices typify Christ. However, not many teachers have gone on to find out how Christ is typified by other items in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35061" data-verses="Exodus 21:1">chapters twenty-one through twenty-three</span> of Exodus. If the altar typifies the cross and if the sacrifices typify Christ, it is logical to expect that the Sabbath day, the sabbatical year, and the feasts of unleavened bread, harvest, and ingathering also typify Christ. We also need to see what the fullness of the harvest and the tears of the presses typify. It is certainly necessary to consider further implications, indications, and significances of the ordinances of the law, especially as they point to Christ and our experience of Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GjYl6ftZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> In principle, every kind of law has a certain spirit and also presents a picture of something, usually of the one who made the law. For example, the Constitution of the United States has a spirit of democracy and freedom. It also is a portrait of the people in the United States and shows that they care for liberty and equality. Hence, the law of the United States is a picture of the citizens of the United States. God’s law also has a spirit and presents a picture. It is very important that we know what is the spirit of the law of God and what is the picture portrayed by God’s law with its many ordinances. We have pointed out that God’s law has God Himself as its spirit. A law always embodies the spirit of the lawgiver. Because the law of God was given <span class="pg" data-page-id="841" id="841">[841]</span> by God, this law has a divine spirit. There can be no doubt that God the Spirit is the spirit of the law decreed by Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQazQNszwAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> Students and teachers of the Bible pay a great deal of attention to the Ten Commandments. Some Christians are able to recite these commandments as easily as they recite the Lord’s prayer. I would make it emphatically clear that I by no means belittle the Ten Commandments or detract from them. Nevertheless, it is a fact that in these commandments it is very difficult to see Christ or the cross. Furthermore, in the Ten Commandments we cannot see the redemption of Christ, the things accomplished by Him on our behalf, or anything related to the enjoyment of Christ. The first commandment forbids having any god other than Jehovah God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35062" data-verses="Exodus 20:3">20:3</span>). Jehovah is our unique Husband, and we should not have another besides Him. The second commandment forbids making a graven image or the likeness of anything and bowing down to it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35063" data-verses="Exodus 20:4-5">20:4-5</span>). The third commandment declares, “Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain: for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35064" data-verses="Exodus 20:7">20:7</span>, lit.). The fourth and fifth commandments are concerned respectively with remembering the Sabbath day and with honoring father and mother (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35065" data-verses="Exodus 20:8-12">20:8-12</span>). The remaining five commandments forbid murder, adultery, stealing, bearing false witness, and coveting (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35066" data-verses="Exodus 20:13-17">20:13-17</span>). Do you see anything of Christ here? Do you see anything of the cross or of Christ’s redemption? Do you find anything of the experience of Christ or the enjoyment of Christ? The answer is that we cannot see Christ in the Ten Commandments. This is the reason for the ordinances in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35067" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-23">Exodus 21 through 23</span>. In many of these ordinances Christ is portrayed. Either He is typified in a rather direct way or He is implied, indicated, or signified indirectly. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755X2-DLj89jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> The ordinances in Exodus actually begin not with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35068" data-verses="Exodus 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span>, but with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35069" data-verses="Exodus 20:22-26">20:22-26</span>. These verses may be regarded as a preliminary word concerning the ordinances. They are the door, or the gateway, into the ordinances in the following chapters. This door provides the way for fallen man to contact God and worship Him. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="842" id="842">[842]</span> only way fallen man can contact God in worship is through the altar and by the sacrifices. This indicates that man can worship God only through the cross and by Christ. It is very significant that before giving us the various ordinances God presents a preliminary ordinance which opens the way for the other ordinances. In this preliminary ordinance we see a clear picture of Christ and His redemption according to God’s economy. In the ordinances we can see Christ and also Christ’s redemption accomplished fully according to the economy of God. As we shall see, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35070" data-verses="Exodus 21:1">chapters twenty-one through twenty-three</span> we have Christ, redemption, and the economy of God. If we would enter into God’s economy, we need a gate, a way, for sinners to contact God. We would emphasize repeatedly that the unique way is the altar and the sacrifices, the cross and Christ. If we are clear concerning this, we shall want to bow before the Lord and worship Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGoDzw6BePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> Both on the positive side and on the negative side, the ordinances of the law are rich in their implications, indications, and significances. In the foregoing message we pointed out that the ordinances portray a black and bleak picture of fallen man. Man is fallen and continues to live in the fall. He is filled with sins: idolatry, fornication, murder, stealing, lying, coveting, and witchcraft. Furthermore, fallen man has not only sins outwardly, but sin, the lustful nature of Satan, dwelling in him. Actually, the sin of covetousness which dwells in us is Satan’s nature. Furthermore, lying and murder point to the Devil, the source of murder and the father of lies, working in fallen man. Both in outward sins and indwelling sin man is related to Satan and even to demons. Witchcraft involves contact with demons. How terrible is the situation of fallen man! He not only sins against God, but he is joined to Satan, involved with demons, and enslaved to sin. </p>

We saw that we need to offer the fullness of our harvest of Christ and the outflow of our experience of the cross; that as those redeemed through Christ as our Substitute, we should be separated unto God; that we should be saturated with Christ as our holiness to become holy men unto God; and that we should not eat anything of death, but take only Christ as our life supply. Furthermore, we saw that we need to care for others and supply them with food by taking Christ as our rest. Finally, we saw that keeping feasts unto God three times a year typifies the full enjoyment of the Triune God in Christ. Now we must go on to cover some supplementary matters related to the keeping of the three feasts. </p>

THE BLOOD OF GOD’S SACRIFICE (CHRIST)<br/>NOT BEING OFFERED WITH LEAVENED BREAD<br/>SIGNIFYING THAT CHRIST’S REDEMPTION<br/>SHOULD BE SEPARATED FROM OUR SINFUL LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-2N9EYXn89qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35107" data-verses="Exodus 23:18-19">Exodus 23:18 and 19</span> give us four supplementary ordinances for the keeping of the feasts. First, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35108" data-verses="Exodus 23:18">verse 18</span> says, “Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread.” This is a warning not to mix Christ’s redemption with our sinful life. When the people came to the feast, they <span class="pg" data-page-id="854" id="854">[854]</span> were not allowed to mix the blood of the sacrifice with leavened bread. This indicates that we should not mix Christ’s redemption with our sinful life. The blood of the sacrifice signifies the redemption of Christ, and leavened bread signifies our sinful life. These two things must never be put together. In order to enjoy Christ’s redemption, we must be separated from our sinful life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB5MJyfAwqRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9">XX.

According to this verse, the fat of God’s feast (Christ) should not remain until morning. This signifies that the riches of Christ should be for our enjoyment with God today, not tomorrow. As Christians we should enjoy Christ today and not put off this enjoyment until tomorrow. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj9D5XHIH4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP">XXI. THE FIRST OF THE FIRSTFRUITS BROUGHT<br/>INTO THE HOUSE OF GOD TYPIFYING<br/>CHRIST AS THE FIRSTFRUIT BEING BROUGHT<br/>TO GOD’S DWELLING PLACE FOR HIS SATISFACTION</h2><p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_bSxl28SNcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35110" data-verses="Exodus 23:19">Exodus 23:19</span> says, “The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of Jehovah thy God” (lit.). According to this verse, the first of the firstfruits were to be brought into the house of God. This typifies Christ as the firstfruit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35111" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:20">1 Cor. 15:20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35112" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:23">23</span>) being brought to God’s dwelling place for His satisfaction. This verse does not speak merely of the firstfruits; it speaks of “the first of the firstfruits.” For example, there may be firstfruits of both peaches and almonds. The almonds, however, may ripen first. This would make the almonds the first of the firstfruits, which should be brought to the temple, God’s house, for His satisfaction. This indicates that in our experience and enjoyment of Christ we should have not only the top experience, but even the topmost of the top experiences <span class="pg" data-page-id="855" id="855">[855]</span> of Christ. This aspect of our experience of Christ should be brought directly to God. No one else should be allowed to enjoy it. Sometimes if we share certain experiences of Christ with others before presenting these experiences to God, we cause our experiences to become common. At other times, we may think that a certain experience of Christ is a topmost experience when it is actually quite ordinary and common. Any experience of Christ that is truly a topmost experience should be kept in secret and then brought to God’s temple and offered directly to God for His satisfaction. </p>

NOT SEETHING A KID IN HIS MOTHER’S MILK<br/>TYPIFYING THAT THE WORD OF GOD<br/>(THE LIFE SUPPLY OF CHRIST)<br/>WHICH NOURISHES THE NEW BELIEVERS<br/>SHOULD NOT BE USED TO KILL THEM</h2><p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4frYY07VCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35113" data-verses="Exodus 23:19">Exodus 23:19</span> also says, “Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother’s milk.” The milk here typifies the milk of the word of God (the life supply of Christ) used to nourish new believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35114" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">1 Pet. 2:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35115" data-verses="Hebrews 5:12-13">Heb. 5:12-13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35116" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:2">1 Cor. 3:2</span>). Not seething a kid in his mother’s milk typifies that the milk of the word of God should not be used to kill new believers in Christ. Use the milk of the word, Christ as life supply, to nourish newborn Christians; do not use it to kill them. Many Christian teachers have “boiled” new believers with superficial teachings concerning Christ. They have used the word of God for “seething” others instead of for feeding them. The word of Christ which produces milk should be used always to nourish the babes in Christ, never to kill them. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP52pf6AP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> As we are enjoying the Triune God in Christ as typified by the feasts, we need to observe these four supplementary ordinances. We should not mix Christ’s redemption with our sinful life. We should not postpone the enjoyment of the riches of Christ until tomorrow. We should offer the topmost experiences of Christ directly to God for His satisfaction. And we should not use the word of Christ to kill new believers, but use it to nourish them. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2miDkmdlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35117" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-23">Exodus 21 through 23</span> we see a picture portrayed by <span class="pg" data-page-id="856" id="856">[856]</span> the ordinances of how we, fallen sinners, have been redeemed by Christ and how we have fled into Him to enjoy Him as our rest and freedom. This picture also shows us how to live in Christ and how to supply others with rest and food. Moreover, the three yearly feasts signify the full enjoyment of the Triune God in Christ, with the feast of ingathering, the feast of tabernacles, pointing to the eternal enjoyment of God in the new heaven and the new earth. Is not all this a revelation of God’s economy? Praise Him for the picture painted in all these ordinances! We should not simply read the ordinances in black and white letters; we also need to pray-read these verses and fellowship over them that we may apprehend the marvelous picture they present. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3k3CJ92EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> I believe it is helpful to consider as a whole the picture presented by the implications, indications, and significances of the ordinances in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35118" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-23">Exodus 21 through 23</span>. These ordinances reveal that we have fled into Christ, have taken Him as our refuge, and now enjoy rest and freedom in Him. As those who are in Christ and who take Him as their rest and freedom, we need to learn how to live in Christ. Because we are in Christ as our refuge, we are no longer in slavery, no longer in the fall. In Christ we have been set free. This reminds us of Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35119" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8:1</span>: “There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.” In Christ we are free and we enjoy rest. In Him there is no condemnation. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9oBuvN1w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> Four important matters are related to living in Christ. First, we must have the fullness of the harvest and also the tears of the presses, the outflow of wine and oil, to offer to God. The fullness is the fullness of the produce gained from laboring on Christ as the good land. Hence, the fullness of the harvest is the reaping of the rich experiences of Christ. As those who live in Christ, we should experience Him. To experience Christ is to labor on Him, to grow Him, and to harvest Him. If we labor on Christ in this way, we shall have the fullness of the harvest to offer to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC42WY-H5C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> Along with the fullness of the harvest, we need to have <span class="pg" data-page-id="857" id="857">[857]</span> the tears of the presses of wine and oil. These tears signify the experiences of Christ through the suffering of the cross. The cross is a press out of which flows wine and oil. As we live in Christ, we should offer to God both the fullness of the harvest and also the tears of the presses. In other words, we should have both the experiences of Christ and the suffering experiences of the cross. The experiences of Christ give us the fullness, and the suffering experiences of the cross give us the tears, the flow of wine to cheer God and man and the flow of oil to please God. Day by day we should offer to God what we experience of Christ and the cross. We should make no delay in presenting to Him the fullness and the tears. </p>

In these chapters we first have the decree of the Ten Commandments and then the decree of the ordinances of the law. In the foregoing messages we have pointed out that if we would get into the depths of the ordinances in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35131" data-verses="Exodus 21:1">chapters twenty-one through twenty-three</span>, we shall see that in them the economy of God with the redemption of Christ is portrayed. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0SXysJox8Wf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> It is very significant that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35132" data-verses="Exodus 23:1">chapter twenty-three</span> concludes with a word about the Angel of Jehovah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35133" data-verses="Exodus 23:20-33">vv. 20-33</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35134" data-verses="Exodus 23:20">Verse 20</span> says, “Behold, I send an Angel before thee to guard thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared” (lit.). The Angel was to bring the people into the promised land. The two main things regarding the land here in these verses are the frustraters and the boundaries. There were people inhabiting the land and frustrating the children of Israel from taking possession of it. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35135" data-verses="Exodus 23:23">Verse 23</span> says, “For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I will cut them off.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35136" data-verses="Exodus 23:31">verse 31</span> we have a word concerning the boundaries of the land: “And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness <span class="pg" data-page-id="862" id="862">[862]</span> unto the river” (lit.). If we would take possession of the promised land, we must deal with the frustraters and also pay attention to the boundaries of the land. Because the Angel of Jehovah plays an important role in leading the people into the land, this message is entitled, “The Angel of Jehovah for His People to Take Possession of the Promised Land.” The concluding word of the decree of the law and the ordinances refers to the Angel of Jehovah and the promised land. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYKAzIAS6zJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> Both the Angel and the promised land are types of Christ. The Angel typifies Christ as the One sent by God to guard us in the way and to bring us into the land. Christ is such a sent One, the One sent from God. The good land typifies Christ in His all-inclusiveness. Thus, Christ as the sent One brings us into Himself as the good land. This good land is the goal, the aim, the mark, of God’s purpose. Since the good land typifies Christ, this means that Christ is the goal. Who will bring us to this goal? No one other than Christ Himself. On the one hand, Christ is the good land; on the other hand, He is the One who brings us into the good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l4CEgIc8l6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> The ordinances in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35137" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-23">Exodus 21 through 23</span> portray at least nineteen different aspects of Christ. Christ is the sacrifice, the slave, the Sabbath, the One delivered to us who were the mistaken sinners that put Him to death, the city of refuge, and the One who brings the things of life to His enemies and releases those who hate Him from their heavy burdens. Furthermore, in these chapters the cross of Christ is typified in two ways. First, the altar in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35138" data-verses="Exodus 20:24-25">20:24 and 25</span> typifies the cross. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35139" data-verses="Hebrews 13:10">Hebrews 13:10</span> says, “We have an altar, from which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle.” This altar refers to the cross on which the Lord Jesus offered Himself as the sacrifice for our sins. The children of Israel had an altar, but that altar was merely a type. We have the fulfillment of this type, the cross as the true altar. Second, the cross is typified by the wine and oil presses which produce the “tears.” These tears signify the outflowing of the experience of Christ through the suffering of the cross. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35140" data-verses="Exodus 22:29">Exodus 22:29</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="863" id="863">[863]</span> speaks of the fullness and the tears (lit.). The fullness signifies the fullness of the harvest of the produce of the good land, and the tears signify the outflow of wine and oil from the presses. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9IhoJlJQHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> On the one hand, the church is a lovely place, and the church life is wonderful. On the other hand, the church life is a wine press and an oil press. Our family life is also a press. We are pressed by our husband or wife and by our children. If we did not have the experience of the press in the church life and in our family life, there would be no tears, no outflow of wine and oil. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGq8JBwZfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> After presenting at least nineteen aspects of Christ and two types of the cross, these chapters conclude with a word about the Angel of Jehovah bringing the people into the promised land. Even the King James Version capitalizes the word Angel in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35141" data-verses="Exodus 23:20">23:20</span>. This indicates that the translators realized that the Angel here is unique and extraordinary. This Angel signifies Christ Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPW9nkqvJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> The fact that the decree of the law concludes with a portion regarding the Angel and the good land indicates that the purpose of the decree of the law is that those who received the law would enter into the good land. It was not God’s intention simply to give the law to His people. His intention was to bring the children of Israel into the good land. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35142" data-verses="Exodus 23:20">Exodus 23:20</span> says, “Behold, I send an Angel before thee...to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.” It seems as if the Lord was saying to His people, “I have given you the law and the ordinances. However, this is not My goal. I did not bring you out of Egypt merely to give you regulations. My intention is to train you, discipline you, and regulate you so that you may be a proper people for Me to bring into the good land. Behold, I send an Angel before you to guard you in the way and to bring you into the promised land. This is My goal.” For this reason, immediately after the decree of the law and the ordinances, God speaks of the Angel bringing the people into the good land. <span class="pg" data-page-id="864" id="864">[864]</span> </p>

Here we have both a Sender and a sent One. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35144" data-verses="Zechariah 2:8-9">Zechariah 2:8 and 9</span> indicate that the Sender and sent One are one. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35145" data-verses="Zechariah 2:8">Verse 8</span> says, “For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you” (lit.). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35146" data-verses="Zechariah 2:9">Verse 9</span> concludes with the words, “Ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me” (lit.). These verses indicate that Jehovah of hosts sent Jehovah of hosts. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35147" data-verses="Zechariah 2:8">verse 8</span>, Jehovah of hosts says, “After the glory hath he sent me.” Here we see that the Sender and the sent One are actually one. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNFf_YHDaKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> Those who follow the way of systematic theology may ask how we can say that Christ the Son and the Father are one. They may point to the fact that the Son prayed to the Father and that the Father answered the Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35148" data-verses="Luke 3:21-22">Luke 3:21-22</span>). If the Father and the Son are one, they ask, how could the Son pray to the Father, and how could the Father answer the Son? The answer is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35149" data-verses="Zechariah 2:1">Zechariah 2</span>. Who is the sent One, and who is the Sender? In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35150" data-verses="Zechariah 2:8-9">Zechariah 2:8 and 9</span> both “he,” the Sender, and “me,” the sent One, refer to Jehovah of hosts.

The same is true in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35151" data-verses="Exodus 23:20">Exodus 23:20</span>, where we are told that the Angel of Jehovah was sent by Jehovah. </p>

This name is in the Angel of Jehovah. Why is the name of Jehovah in the Angel? Simply because the Angel is Jehovah Himself. If the Angel were not Jehovah, how could Jehovah’s name be in him? The name of a person is identical to the person himself. We cannot separate a person from his name, for his name indicates his very being. For this reason, we do not simply speak of ourselves as persons, but we <span class="pg" data-page-id="865" id="865">[865]</span> identify ourselves by name. The name of Jehovah was in the Angel and inseparable from the Angel. </p>

<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJhu_KBZPAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> In the foregoing message we began to consider from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35186" data-verses="Exodus 23:20-33">23:20-33</span> the matter of the Angel of Jehovah for His people to take possession of the promised land. We saw that the Angel of Jehovah was sent by Jehovah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35187" data-verses="Exodus 23:20">v. 20</span>), that Jehovah’s name is in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35188" data-verses="Exodus 23:21">v. 21</span>), and that He is actually Jehovah Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35189" data-verses="Exodus 3:2">3:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35190" data-verses="Exodus 3:4">4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35191" data-verses="Exodus 3:6">6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35192" data-verses="Exodus 3:14">14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35193" data-verses="Exodus 3:16">16</span>). Furthermore, we pointed out that His voice was Jehovah’s speaking and that He went before the children of Israel to guard them in the way and to bring them into the good land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35194" data-verses="Exodus 23:20">23:20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35195" data-verses="Exodus 23:23">23</span>). We also considered the boundaries of the promised land: from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines, the Mediterranean, and from the wilderness to the Euphrates. We also saw that there were frustraters in the land, the pagan tribes with their idols. Finally, in a very general way we shared a word about how to take possession of the land. In this message and in the message following, we need to pay attention to the details concerning the way to take possession of the land. No matter how much we may know about the Angel of Jehovah and about the good land, this knowledge may be vain if we do not see the way to take possession of the land. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqH8gB-nyUXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> Taking possession of the good land is the terminology found in the typology in the Old Testament. In the New Testament Paul speaks of gaining Christ, obtaining Christ, <span class="pg" data-page-id="874" id="874">[874]</span> laying hold of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35196" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">Phil. 3:8</span>). These expressions from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35197" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span> are the fulfillment of the type of possessing the promised land in the Old Testament. Today we need to experience the all-inclusive Christ typified by the good land. My burden in this message is related to the way to take possession of Christ, the way to experience Christ, win Christ, gain Christ, obtain Christ, take hold of Christ, and grasp Christ. As a help in this matter, we need to patiently consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35198" data-verses="Exodus 23:20-33">Exodus 23:20-33</span> in detail, digging into these verses in order to see the riches they contain. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2AyM4RSr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> At this point I wish to say that we do not intend to allegorize the Old Testament according to a certain interpretation. On the contrary, what we are doing is fitting various portions of the Word together in order to see a complete picture. This is not to allegorize or to guess at the meaning of things. This is to fit different parts of the Word together in order to see a picture of spiritual things, which are otherwise invisible. The matters related to spiritual experience are real, but they are mysterious and invisible. For this reason, God has given us both the types in the Old Testament and statements of fact in the New Testament. The Old Testament types are pictures of the spiritual realities revealed in the New Testament. Just as children put together the pieces of a puzzle, so we need to fit together various parts of the Bible in order to see a picture. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7TgIuYeKO1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> It takes time and patience to assemble a puzzle of hundreds of pieces. First you need to try one piece and then another. Eventually, little by little a picture comes into view. Do you want to see a portrait of the wonderful, heavenly, spiritual, and divine things in the Word of God? If you do, then patiently and diligently you need to put the pieces of the “puzzle” of the Bible together. I repeat, to allegorize the Old Testament in a certain way is not my way. Rather, my way is to fit the pieces together until a picture comes into view. In this message I shall present another picture which I have seen through patient study of the Word and prayer over the Word. <span class="pg" data-page-id="875" id="875">[875]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9oAOvN3w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> We have seen that the ordinances in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35199" data-verses="Exodus 21:1-23">Exodus 21 through 23</span> are very rich in their implications, indications, and significances. It is indeed significant that these three chapters conclude with a word concerning the Angel of Jehovah bringing God’s people into the promised land. Christ as God’s sent One guards us in the way and brings us into Himself as the all-inclusive good land. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35200" data-verses="Exodus 23:20-33">23:20-33</span> tells us in a detailed way not only how to enter into the land, but also how to take possession of this land for our enjoyment. Actually in these verses not a great deal is said either concerning the Angel of Jehovah or concerning the good land itself. But a good deal of attention is given to the frustraters, the pagan tribes that would keep God’s people from possessing the promised land. Yet the description of the way to take possession of the land is even more detailed than that of the frustraters. This indicates that if we would experience Christ we must, on the one hand, know the frustraters and, on the other hand, know the detailed way to take possession of Christ and gain Him experientially. Just as we need a detailed map to find our way around a city, so we need the details in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35201" data-verses="Exodus 23:20-33">23:20-33</span> in order to know the way to possess the good land for our enjoyment. A general sketch is helpful, but it is not adequate. The driver of an automobile needs not only a bird’s eye view of the city, but also a detailed understanding of the streets. Then he will be able to find his way. In these fourteen verses we have a detailed “map” for our spiritual “driving” into the promised land, the all-inclusive Christ. </p>

By Obeying the Angel of Jehovah</h2><p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTbOAwBDXVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> If we would take possession of the promised land, we must learn to obey the Angel of Jehovah, the One sent to us from God. This Angel, this sent One, is Jesus Christ. God sent Christ to us in a way that involves many steps: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, burial, resurrection, ascension, glorification, and enthronement. By means of all these steps, God has sent Christ, His Angel, to us. Now that He is with us, we must obey Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="876" id="876">[876]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8DKu1K3xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> In order to take possession of Christ, we need to realize that we have Him with us, even within us, as a living Person. This means that we have the living Christ Himself, not a system of doctrines. This living Person is now in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35202" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">Col. 1:27</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35203" data-verses="Romans 8:9">Romans 8:9</span> says, “If anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.” If we do not have Christ in us, we do not belong to Him. Instead, we belong to the Devil, the demons, and the world. Praise the Lord that Jesus Christ is in us! We have Him as the sent One, the Angel of Jehovah, who has come to us through the wonderful process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, burial, resurrection, ascension, glorification, and enthronement. How marvelous that such a One has been sent to be with us! </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m5BL4CMpyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> Many Christians today do not realize that the living Person of Christ is with them and in them. They may care for biblical doctrines, but they may not pay attention to the living One. In an article entitled “The Waning Authority of Christ in the Churches” A. W. Tozer strongly points out that believers today neglect the living Christ and His lordship. Christians may care for their mission work, gospel preaching, or teaching of the Bible and theology, but may pay virtually no attention to the living Person of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh73PqmPovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35204" data-verses="Exodus 23:21-22">23:21 and 22</span>, God does not say, “I have given you teachings to follow.” No, here the Lord says of the Angel, “Take ye heed before him, and obey his voice...obey his voice, and do all that I speak” (lit.). Twice we are told to obey the voice of the Angel, for His voice is God’s speaking. This means that as the Angel, the sent One, Christ speaks for God. How crucial, then, that we obey His voice! </p>

The Source of Sin against Jehovah </h2>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVKinNMZne1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> In order to take possession of the promised land, God’s people must cooperate with Him in destroying the pagan tribes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35229" data-verses="Exodus 23:31-33">23:31-33</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35230" data-verses="Exodus 23:33">Exodus 23:33</span> says, “They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me.” It is a fact of history that the pagan tribes were the source of Israel’s sin in the good land. When Israel lived in the promised land, their sins came from the source of the pagan tribes that were still in the land. This indicates that the natural life is the source of sin. Our sins come from our natural life. Whether our sins are gross or somewhat refined and cultured, they have their source in the natural life. Some people are refined and polite even in the way they lose their temper. Sometimes a husband may be very cultured and refined in the way he offends his wife. Such culture and refinement are actually a mask. Wearing this kind of mask, people often lie by speaking the truth. Even sins that appear to be rather refined come from the natural life. In the sight of God, all <span class="pg" data-page-id="886" id="886">[886]</span> those who live according to the natural life are sinning continually, even when they give alms or donate to charity. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoaVMLWzrNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> As the source of sin among God’s people, the natural life frustrates them from possessing Christ as the good land. Because the natural life keeps us from possessing Christ and enjoying Him, we must hate it and, as we grow, be willing to drive it out. As we have pointed out, without growth in Christ it is not possible for us to drive out the natural life. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVKinNELXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2">2. Making No Covenant with Them</h2><p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJt2ce--Viqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> The children of Israel were forbidden to make any covenant with the pagan tribes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35231" data-verses="Exodus 23:32">v. 32</span>). Today we should not make any covenants with the natural life. To make a covenant with the natural life is to compromise with it. Because it is not easy to eliminate the natural life, we may be tempted to compromise with it. To compromise in this way is to tolerate some aspect of the natural life. But we should not tolerate the natural life in any way. Whether or not we are able to drive out the natural life, we still must hate it. Instead of agreeing with any aspect of your natural life, hate it and do what you can to drive it out. Of course, without growth, your attempts to drive out the natural life will be in vain. The more you grow, the more you will be able to drive it out. If we take the initiative to drive out the natural life, God will come in to honor us and strengthen us in this matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRA4Lagmj2TX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> This principle is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35232" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. Yes, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35233" data-verses="Romans 8:11">Romans 8:11</span> indicates that God will give life to our mortal bodies. But this depends on whether or not we take the initiative to put to death the practices of our body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35234" data-verses="Romans 8:13">Rom. 8:13</span>). If we take the initiative to do this, God will honor this by giving life to our mortal bodies. God is ready to give us life, but we must be willing to kill the practices of the body. If we are not willing to do this, not willing to cooperate with God, God has no way to impart life to our mortal bodies. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTNyhBVRcNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35235" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, we should also take the initiative to walk according to spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35236" data-verses="Romans 8:4">v. 4</span>), to mind the things of the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35237" data-verses="Romans 8:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>), and to be led by the Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35238" data-verses="Romans 8:14">Verse 14</span> says, “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of <span class="pg" data-page-id="887" id="887">[887]</span> God.” This verse does not speak of the leading of the Spirit, but of our being led by the Spirit. The Spirit is willing to lead us, but we must be willing to be led by Him. If we are not willing to be led, there is no way for the Spirit to lead us. Therefore, it is first our responsibility to be led; then it is the responsibility of the Spirit to lead us. Even in this matter, we must take the initiative. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5eS5lOcEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35239" data-verses="Romans 8:15">Romans 8:15</span>, we should also take the initiative in crying “Abba, Father.” This verse says that we have received “a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father.” A verse parallel to this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35240" data-verses="Galatians 4:6">Galatians 4:6</span>, says that it is the Spirit who cries “Abba, Father.” Who is it, then, who cries out, we or the Spirit? The answer is that both we and the Spirit cry together. Although the Spirit is ready to cry, we must take the initiative. He cries when we cry. But if we do not cry, He will not cry either. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FbTG3mSwPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35241" data-verses="Romans 8:16">Romans 8:16</span> says, “The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.” This verse indicates that we must be the first to witness, then the Spirit will witness. We are not told that our spirit witnesses with the Spirit, but that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. When our spirit testifies, the Spirit honors our testifying and testifies with our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr86_9Sre4pcJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35242" data-verses="Romans 8:23">Romans 8:23</span> speaks of our groaning, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35243" data-verses="Romans 8:26">verse 26</span>, of the Spirit interceding for us “with groanings which cannot be uttered.” When we groan, the Spirit intercedes. Actually, He intercedes in our groaning. If we do not groan, the interceding Spirit has no way to work. Therefore, we need to groan, the more the better. By taking the initiative to groan, we give the Spirit an opportunity to intercede on our behalf. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjkbMNXNmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35244" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, God gives life and the Spirit leads, witnesses, and intercedes. However, these four activities depend on our taking the initiative. When we put to death the practices of the body, God gives life. When we are willing to be led, the Spirit leads. When we cry Abba, Father, the Spirit cries. When we witness, the Spirit witnesses. Furthermore, when we groan, the Spirit intercedes. In the same principle, when we drive out the pagan tribes, the natural <span class="pg" data-page-id="888" id="888">[888]</span> life, God also drives out these tribes. Hence, we and God together drive out the natural life. Nevertheless, we must again emphasize the fact that we must take the initiative. It is easy for God to drive out the tribes. He is always ready to do this, but we usually are not ready. Instead, we may make a covenant with them. In such a situation, God has no way to drive them out. Therefore, it is crucial for us to take the initiative to drive out the natural life. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD9qDasbW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> Catholicism teaches that we must work for salvation. At the time of the Reformation, Luther fought against this teaching and declared that salvation is by grace, not by works. We are justified through faith, not through works. After the Reformation two schools of theology came into being: the Calvinist school, which emphasizes God’s sovereign mercy and grace, and the Arminian school, which claims that a person can lose his salvation and that good works are necessary to keep one from losing his salvation. Although the Calvinist teaching is far more accurate than the Arminian, it is not complete. According to the Bible, everything is by God’s grace. Nevertheless, man must cooperate with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzINNNzQ_D9BVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> This cooperation can be illustrated by a mother feeding her child. No matter how much the mother loves the child and how carefully she prepares nourishing food for him, she cannot eat for him. The child must take the initiative to eat the food prepared by his mother. In the same principle, we must take the initiative to cooperate with God’s working. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqe-x6Hcj0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> This was the reason on the day of Pentecost Peter commanded the people to repent and be saved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35245" data-verses="Acts 2:37-40">Acts 2:37-40</span>). God cannot repent for us or believe for us. We ourselves must repent and believe. To be sure, we cannot save ourselves. God has done everything necessary to save us, but we must still repent and believe. We cannot save ourselves, but we can, in Peter’s words, “be saved.” The Savior is at hand, ready to save us. But we must be willing to be saved. In this matter we take the initiative. This is a basic principle in the Bible. </p>

<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjkb8NQdGh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35261" data-verses="Exodus 24:1-8">24:1-8</span>. After the decree of the law with the ordinances, God charged Moses to bring the leaders of Israel up to the mountain to stay with Him for a particular thing: to receive the vision of the tabernacle which they were to build as His dwelling place on earth. As we have pointed out, the book of Exodus begins with God’s redemption and concludes with God’s dwelling place. God needs a people to be His dwelling place on earth. However, because the people God created became fallen, it was necessary for God to come in to accomplish redemption. God not only redeemed His people; He also rescued them, delivering them from their bondage in Egypt and bringing them to the wilderness to have intimate fellowship with Him. In the messages given on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35262" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapters nineteen through twenty-three</span>, we have seen the intimate and thorough fellowship God had with His chosen and redeemed people. During the course of this intimate fellowship between God and His people, God revealed Himself to them. He made known what kind of God He is. Many Christians think that the giving of the Ten Commandments was merely a decree of the law. Apparently this is true; actually it is not entirely true. The giving of the law was the unveiling of what God is. This means that through the decree of the law God revealed Himself to His chosen and redeemed people. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD9qzaqLm2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> We have pointed out that in the Old Testament the law is called the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35263" data-verses="Exodus 31:18">Exo. 31:18</span>). This testimony is a portrait, a picture, a photograph, of God. The law with its <span class="pg" data-page-id="896" id="896">[896]</span> ordinances shows us what kind of God our God is. By reading the Ten Commandments and all the ordinances of the law, we can realize what God is like. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzINNNDQ1RdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> Legislators or lawmakers are always revealed in the kind of laws they enact. In fact, the law made by a person is always a revelation of that person. In the same principle, the law in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35264" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">chapter twenty</span> with the ordinances in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35265" data-verses="Exodus 21:1">chapters twenty-one through twenty-three</span> provides a detailed portrait of God, showing us what He is. For this reason, we should not be satisfied simply with reciting the Ten Commandments. It is not adequate merely to know the commandments about not having another God, not making images and worshipping them, not using God’s name in vain, keeping the Sabbath, honoring one’s parents, not committing murder or adultery, and not stealing, bearing false witness, or coveting. It is crucial to realize that the law is a portrait revealing what kind of God has chosen us, called us, and redeemed us. We are thankful to the Lord for the clear picture of Himself He has given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35266" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">chapters twenty through twenty-three</span>. Here we see that God is holy and righteous, that He is full of love and light. Because God is holy, with Him there is nothing common. Because He is righteous, with Him there is no injustice. Because He is love and light, with Him there is no hatred or darkness. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqe-B6MOT0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> In the ordinances found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35267" data-verses="Exodus 21:1">chapters twenty-one through twenty-three</span> we see a clear view of God’s economy. We have pointed out that in these ordinances we have the cross, Christ, and Christ’s redemption. Therefore, through the law and the ordinances we have a revelation of God and His economy. How wonderful! May we be deeply impressed that the law and the ordinances decreed by God on Mount Sinai present a clear view of God and His economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZSzD8-EcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> After giving His people such a revelation of Himself and His economy, God’s intention was to reveal the desire of His heart. The desire of God’s heart is to have a dwelling place with man on earth. After a time of intimate fellowship with His redeemed people, God wanted to open His heart and <span class="pg" data-page-id="897" id="897">[897]</span> make known to them that the desire of His heart is to have a dwelling place on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-ePQcLwIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> It is unfortunate that today many of God’s redeemed people do not even have intimate fellowship with Him. A good number of Christians know God hardly at all, and they know nothing of His economy. However, by God’s mercy certain of the saints have entered into intimate fellowship with Him. In this fellowship they have come to know what God is and, at least to some extent, what God’s economy is. Nevertheless, rarely do we find Christians who have truly been brought into the desire of God’s heart to see that His desire is to have a dwelling place on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cB1uP1TYwWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> In today’s Christian meetings, gatherings, and “services,” seldom, if ever, is there a message on God’s building, although messages are given on fellowship between God and man. Believers may be charged to spend time in the Lord’s presence to have fellowship with Him. But where are the messages on the building? Before you came into the Lord’s recovery, did you ever hear a message on God’s building? This matter is neglected by Christians today. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTl4OAE5AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> We praise the Lord that the book of Exodus has not only twenty-three or twenty-four chapters, but forty chapters. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35268" data-verses="Exodus 24:1">Chapter twenty-four</span> is a bridge connecting the first twenty-three chapters with the last sixteen. In this message and in a few that follow, we shall walk on this bridge from one section of Exodus to the other. When we get to the other side, composed of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35269" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">chapters twenty-five through forty</span>, we shall see the desire of God’s heart concerning His tabernacle built by His people on earth. Although we may be eager to get to the other side, we cannot do so without spending a certain amount of time on the bridge. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd86476zFfZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35270" data-verses="Exodus 24:1-2">Exodus 24:1 and 2</span> say, “And he said unto Moses, Come up unto Jehovah, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off. And Moses alone shall come near Jehovah: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him” (lit.). God had a particular purpose in wanting these leaders of Israel to come up on the mountain: it was to show them the <span class="pg" data-page-id="898" id="898">[898]</span> vision, the design, the blueprint, of the tabernacle as His building. After Moses received this charge from God, he descended from the mountain. But before ascending the mountain again with the leaders of the people, Moses enacted the law. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35271" data-verses="Exodus 24:1-2">verses 1 and 2</span>, therefore, we have God’s charge that Moses bring up with him to the mountain certain leaders of the people so that they might have fellowship with God and that God might reveal to them the desire of His heart. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35272" data-verses="Exodus 24:3-8">verses 3 through 8</span> we have Moses’ enactment of the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIBOqIRi-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> After the law was enacted, it became a covenant. Without such an enactment, the law simply would have remained the law; it could not have been a covenant. But as soon as the law was enacted, it became a covenant between God and His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbANONgI6HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> A covenant involves two or more parties. Here the covenant was between God and His people. This making of a covenant was a tremendous matter. Using today’s words, this covenant was an agreement or a contract. The proper way for a contract to be enacted today is for the participating parties to sign it. A time is set, and an official document is prepared. Then all the parties concerned, perhaps accompanied by witnesses, sign this document. In some cases, the parties make an oath or a pledge. Without such an official enactment, the contract would exist as a written statement, but it would not be binding on either party. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0SXz8JuisWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> Although the law had been decreed on the mountain of God, there was still the need for the law with its ordinances to be enacted. Thus, before Moses climbed the mountain again with the leaders to receive further revelation, he took care of enacting the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYKBjIJCazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> Here I wish to point out that the revelation Moses received on the mountain of God was of two parts: the first part was the decree of the law in intimate fellowship with God; the second was the revelation of the design of God’s building. Before the second part of the revelation was given, Moses was told to go down, call the leading ones, and bring them up to the mountain. This indicates that the second <span class="pg" data-page-id="899" id="899">[899]</span> part of the revelation was even more crucial than the first. Moses was not to receive it alone; he had to bring with him Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders. Only then would God show him the plan of His building. Furthermore, the fact that Moses enacted the law before ascending the mountain again shows that this enactment was very important. </p>

We have seen that when Moses enacted the covenant, he built both an altar and twelve pillars. The altar indicates that we need to be redeemed, terminated, and replaced. The pillars signify that we need to become a living testimony of God, a reflection of what He is. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wN0tG3Ms_l3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e">III. WITH BURNT OFFERINGS AND PEACE OFFERINGS</h2><p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4doa-AwKTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35291" data-verses="Exodus 24:5">Exodus 24:5</span> says, “And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto Jehovah” (lit.). It is not difficult to understand the significance of these offerings. The burnt offering was for God’s satisfaction. We were created by God for His satisfaction. However, because of the fall man has failed to satisfy God. Eventually Christ came as the second man and fully satisfied God. Thus, He could be the burnt offering to satisfy God. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj9D4HHAVIFazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> After God was satisfied through the burnt offering, there could be peace between God and man. This peace depends on the peace offering. When man and God together enjoy Christ, there is mutual satisfaction and peace. Christ first became the burnt offering offered to God to satisfy Him, and then He became the peace offering to make peace between man and God. Eventually, Christ became a feast for God and man to enjoy mutually. This is the Christ who has redeemed <span class="pg" data-page-id="908" id="908">[908]</span> us and terminated us and who is now replacing us. The more we are replaced by Christ in our experience, the more we become the burnt offering and the peace offering. Day by day we satisfy God and enjoy peace with Him as we feast on Christ with God and enjoy Him with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjkbsNXPmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> By our own efforts to keep the law it is impossible for us to satisfy God, to have peace with God, or to enjoy Christ with God. I say again that God did not give the law to His people with the intention that they observe it. God’s intention is for the people to be replaced by Christ and to become a reflection of God. This is God’s economy. We thank Him that in the recovery this has been made clear to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPD9qjasZW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> According to the natural concept, the almighty God, the Creator, the holy One, has given us the law that we may observe and keep it. Although this religious concept is common among Christians today, it is far off from God’s economy. We in the recovery may still be under the influence of this concept, perhaps subconsciously, to some degree. After listening to a particular message, we may pray, “Lord, I make up my mind to live according to this message. Please help me carry out my decision.” This kind of prayer exposes the fact that we are still under the influence of the natural, religious concept. It takes a long time to be fully free from this influence. When we read a certain requirement in the Bible, it is easy for us to make up our mind to fulfill that requirement ourselves. Like the children of Israel at Mount Sinai, we promise the Lord that we shall do whatever He says. However, if we are enlightened by the Lord, we would no longer make up our mind to do what He requires. Instead, we would pray, “Lord, have mercy on me, for I am not able to do what You require. Lord, I praise You that You have redeemed me and terminated me and that You are in the process of replacing me with Yourself and making me Your reflection.” </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzINNNTQ8DdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> Praise the Lord that we have the cross to terminate us and Christ to replace us! Christ is our burnt offering and our peace offering. As we experience Him, He makes us a living burnt offering and peace offering. This does not come from <span class="pg" data-page-id="909" id="909">[909]</span> trying to keep the law; it issues from experiencing the altar and the sacrifice, the cross for termination and replacement to become God’s testimony. If we experience Christ and the cross in this way, we shall have not only the altar and the sacrifices, but also the twelve pillars. Hallelujah for Christ’s marvelous redemption and replacement that can transform fallen, corrupted sinners into pillars! </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqe-R6EcD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> Do not strive to keep God’s law. Christ has redeemed you, and now He is in the process of replacing you, reconstituting you, and rearranging you to make you a living testimony of God, His reflection. If you walk according to spirit and set your mind on the spirit, automatically the righteous requirements of the law will be fulfilled in you, and you will become a testimony of God. </p>

Although we are sinful, fallen, and corrupted, we have the blood for our redemption and for the forgiveness of sins. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35293" data-verses="Hebrews 9:22">Hebrews 9:22</span> declares, “And almost all things are purified by blood according to the law, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.” </p>

Less than a year before the covenant was enacted at Mount Sinai, the children of Israel put the blood of the lamb on the doorposts of their houses. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2VRhwzAoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> Moses sprinkled the blood on “both the book itself and all the people” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35295" data-verses="Hebrews 9:19">Heb. 9:19</span>) and said, “This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded to you,” as an indication that the children of Israel were sinful and needed the covering of the blood. This blood came from the sacrifices, and the sacrifices typify Christ. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35296" data-verses="1Peter 1:18-19">1 Peter 1:18 and 19</span> say that we were redeemed with the precious blood of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zAvhavwSXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> The Old Testament not only reveals the covenant enacted in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35297" data-verses="Exodus 24:1-8">24:1-8</span>, but also prophesies of a new covenant. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35298" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:33">Jeremiah 31:33</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="910" id="910">[910]</span> says, “But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35299" data-verses="Ezekiel 36:26-27">Ezekiel 36:26 and 27</span> the Lord made this promise: “A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep mine ordinances, and do them” (lit.). These prophecies indicate that God would make another covenant with His people, a covenant which would make up for any shortage in the first covenant. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35300" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:33">Jeremiah 31:33</span> God promised to write His law in the hearts of the people, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35301" data-verses="Ezekiel 36:1">Ezekiel 36</span> He pledged to change their nature by giving them a new heart and to regenerate them by putting a new spirit and also His Spirit within them. For the law to be inscribed on our inner being means that we are regenerated, that we receive a new nature, and that God’s Spirit is placed within us. The result, as indicated by the enactment of the covenant, is that we are replaced by Christ and spontaneously live in a way which corresponds to the righteous requirement of God’s law. Then instead of being those who try to keep the law, we shall be a living reflection of the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgaC4vSKvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> We have seen that for God’s people to become His living testimony and reflection, they had to be redeemed, terminated, and replaced. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35302" data-verses="Ezekiel 36:1">Ezekiel 36</span>, this results from a profound inward change, from receiving a new heart, a new spirit, and the divine Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjI0BKiyxM7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> All these matters have their counterpart in the New Testament. The New Testament reveals the cross of Christ through which we are redeemed, terminated, and replaced. The New Testament also reveals that, as those who believe in Christ, we have a new nature, that we have been regenerated to receive a new spirit, and that the divine Spirit, God Himself, dwells in our spirit. Now if we walk according to the mingled spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with our spirit, we shall have a living which is the reflection of God. All this is <span class="pg" data-page-id="911" id="911">[911]</span> made possible because we have the precious blood of Christ to cleanse us of our sins. Thus, our sins are cleansed, and we become God’s reflection. </p>

Many Christians may not be familiar with the term “the blood of the covenant” found in this verse. This expression is also used by the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35327" data-verses="Matthew 26:28">Matthew 26:28</span>. Even readers of the Bible who are familiar with the term “the blood of the covenant” may not know the true significance of it. This matter comes from the heart of God. However, it has no place in the heart of the natural man. Certain things found in the Bible may correspond to what is in our heart. For this reason, when we come across these things in the Word, we automatically pay attention to them. Other matters, however, are far beyond our concept. When we read of them in the Word, we may not be impressed. This is the case with the blood of the covenant. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC42U4-Bpy81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> Why did Moses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35328" data-verses="Exodus 24:8">24:8</span> speak of the blood of the covenant? Why did the Lord Jesus say on the night He was betrayed, “This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35329" data-verses="Matthew 26:28">Matt. 26:28</span>)? The Lord’s word here seems to be at least a reference to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35330" data-verses="Exodus 24:8">Exodus 24:8</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35331" data-verses="Luke 22:20">Luke 22:20</span> speaks of the new covenant. This indicates that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35332" data-verses="Exodus 24:8">24:8</span> we have the blood of the old covenant and that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35333" data-verses="Matthew 26:28">Matthew 26:28</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35334" data-verses="Luke 22:20">Luke 22:20</span> we have the blood of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="916" id="916">[916]</span> new covenant. Both for the Old Testament and the New Testament the blood was necessary. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTbODwBKFVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> I do not believe that many of us have been impressed with the fact that the blood is the blood of the covenant. We may realize that the blood is the redeeming blood, the cleansing blood, the sanctifying blood, and the blood which overcomes the enemy. But have you ever paid attention to the fact that the blood is also called the blood of the covenant? This is a matter of great significance. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8DJu1Clhnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF">THE ENACTMENT OF THE LAW</h2><p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYKCDIJAazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> Before we consider the significance of the blood of the covenant, I would like to point out once again that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35335" data-verses="Exodus 24:1">Exodus 24</span> we have the enactment of the law. Prior to this, the law was decreed by God and, through Moses as their representative, it was received by the children of Israel. As we have pointed out, Moses enacted the law in a way that was quite different from what we would expect according to the natural concept. Instead of charging the people to observe the law of God, Moses built an altar. An altar, no doubt, is for sacrifices. But what have sacrifices to do with the law? If we consider this matter, we shall realize that the law does not necessarily involve sacrifices. Why, then, in the enactment of the law did Moses build an altar? The altar points to the need for redemption, termination, and replacement. Because we are fallen, sinful, and corrupt, we need redemption and termination. We also need to be replaced by Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l4A0gAOMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> Moses also built twelve pillars representing the twelve tribes of Israel. These pillars indicate, or signify, that after God’s people have been redeemed, terminated, and replaced at the altar, they can become the testimony of God reflecting what He is. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBntT7yNFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35336" data-verses="Exodus 24:6">Exodus 24:6</span> says, “And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.” We have seen that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35337" data-verses="Exodus 24:8">verse 8</span>, Moses also sprinkled the blood on the people and said, “Behold the blood of the covenant.” To be sure, the blood came from the sacrifices offered on the altar. It was the blood and neither <span class="pg" data-page-id="917" id="917">[917]</span> the altar nor the pillars which made effective the enactment of the law. The covenant was established by the blood which came from the sacrifices offered on the altar. Thus, the altar with the sacrifices produced the blood for the enactment of the law. In the enactment of the law, the blood is the focus. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Bjuzj9qck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> Apparently the altar, the pillars, the sacrifices, and the blood are not related in any way to the law. Why did Moses use all these things when he enacted the law? What Moses did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35338" data-verses="Exodus 24:1">Exodus 24</span> is related to God’s economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_Gja16fsZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M">GOD’S INTENTION IN DECREEING THE LAW</h2><p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQazSdszxAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> In the foregoing message we placed great emphasis on the fact that it was not God’s intention to have His people observe the law He decreed. It is impossible for fallen, sinful, and corrupted people to keep the law. They simply do not have the ability to observe the law of God. Even though God did not intend for the people to keep the law, they presumed that since God had given them His law, they were expected to keep it. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35339" data-verses="Exodus 24:3">Exodus 24:3</span> says, “All the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which Jehovah hath said will we do” (lit.). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35340" data-verses="Exodus 24:7">verse 7</span>, the people promised, “All that Jehovah hath said will we do, and be obedient” (lit.). Here we see two different intentions. The intention of God in decreeing the law was different from the intention of the people who received it. These two intentions did not correspond to each other. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755X28TLj99jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> If it was not God’s intention that His people observe the law decreed by Him, then what was His intention in giving them His law? In decreeing the law, God’s intention was to reveal to His chosen and redeemed people what kind of God He is. This is the reason the law of God is called the testimony. As the testimony of God, the law is a portrait or photograph of God. Therefore, the first function of the law is to reveal God. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGoBjw6AePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> The second function of God’s law is to cause His people to realize that they are fallen and far away from God. As a sinful and corrupt people, it is not possible for them to please God. They need the Lord’s redemption. Only through <span class="pg" data-page-id="918" id="918">[918]</span> the redeeming blood can they have contact with God. If through redemption God’s people are brought to Him and have contact with Him, they will then have God infused into them. The more contact they have with God, the more they will receive the infusion of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJht_KGJvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY">THE REDEEMING BLOOD<br/>AND THE PRESENCE OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqH8jB-hikXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> As the representative of the children of Israel, Moses was brought into the presence of God and stayed there for quite a time. If the redeeming blood had not been in view, God could not have tolerated a fallen, sinful, corrupted man remaining in His presence. Do you think that Moses was perfect? Do you think that he was not fallen, sinful, or corrupt? Moses was fallen, sinful, and corrupt, just as all the other children of Israel were. Then how could such a sinful person stay in the presence of God on the mountaintop for a period of forty days? Moses could remain in God’s presence because God had the redeeming blood in view. The blood was the ground which enabled God to permit Moses to come into His presence and stay there. This means that under the redeeming blood Moses could come into the presence of God. </p>

The book of the law was clean, but when it was brought down to the people, it became unclean. We have very little realization of how contaminated and defiled we are, and how contagious is the evil within us. Anything we touch immediately becomes unclean. This was the reason that even the book of the law needed the sprinkling of the blood. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIBNaIZxO3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> The people were foolish in promising to do whatever the Lord required of them. Moses, however, was not foolish. He did not take heed to the promise made by the children of Israel. Instead, he sprinkled the blood on all those foolish ones. He realized that they needed the cleansing of the blood, and he sprinkled them with the blood. This sprinkling of the blood indicates that one party of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="924" id="924">[924]</span> covenanters was sinful and needed forgiveness. It also indicates that God was willing to forgive. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35362" data-verses="Hebrews 8:12">Hebrews 8:12</span> reveals God’s willingness to forgive His people: “For I will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I will by no means remember anymore.” </p>

The very fact that blood is mentioned indicates that the children of Israel needed forgiveness and that God was ready to forgive them. If God had not been willing to forgive the people, He could have set the sacrifices aside and put the people all to death. But blood was shed as the necessary requirement for the forgiveness of sins. </p>

I emphasized the matters of a new heart, a new spirit, and the Spirit of God. A certain sister was bothered by the fact that I made a distinction between the heart and the spirit. She could not understand the difference. According to her concept, the heart and the spirit were the same. I endeavored to explain that we have a heart with which to love the Lord and a spirit with which to contact Him and receive Him. Taking a Bible in my hand, I told her that although she may love the Bible with her heart, she would have to use her hand to receive it. Eventually she understood that although we may love God with our hearts, we need another organ, the spirit, to contact Him and receive Him.

<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Bsszj54Mk5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> The book of Exodus may be divided into two sections: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35417" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">chapters one through twenty-four</span> as the first section and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35418" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">chapters twenty-five through forty</span> as the second. The second section, composed of sixteen chapters, is primarily a record of visions concerning the tabernacle. These chapters contain very little history. Here we see the details concerning the design, materials, and construction of the tabernacle as God’s dwelling place on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GsY16Y_5KauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> Many Christians have read through the book of Exodus without being deeply impressed with the fact that the goal of God’s salvation is to bring His redeemed people into His dwelling place on earth. God’s aim in His salvation is to make us His dwelling place. This crucial matter must be emphasized repeatedly until it makes a deep impression on us. Therefore, we need many messages covering the details of the wonderful, heavenly visions described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35419" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">chapters twenty-five through forty</span> of Exodus. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQa8Qds1iwajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> During the last century and a half, Bible teachers among the Brethren have written a number of books about the tabernacle and its furniture, including the ark, the incense altar, the showbread table, the lampstand, the laver, and the brass altar. However, when I was with the Brethren I was never told that today’s church is God’s tabernacle. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755X5-TLqu9jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> In the Bible the word tabernacle is used in three <span class="pg" data-page-id="936" id="936">[936]</span> ways. First, it refers to the tabernacle built at the foot of Mount Sinai. Second, it denotes the Lord Jesus as God’s tabernacle with man. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35420" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> says that the Word, which is God, “became flesh and tabernacled among us.” Through incarnation, Christ became God’s tabernacle on earth. Hence, the tabernacle in Exodus is a type of Christ as the tabernacle of God. Third, the tabernacle refers to the New Jerusalem, the ultimate, consummate, enlarged tabernacle of God which includes God’s redeemed people from both the Old Testament and the New Testament. The goal of God’s salvation revealed in the book of Exodus is to bring His people into the tabernacle as His dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGnDjwyTOPzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> In this message we shall consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35421" data-verses="Exodus 24:1-2">24:1-2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35422" data-verses="Exodus 24:9-18">9-18</span>. When we come to this portion of Exodus, we are at the threshold of the heavenly visions contained in the following chapters. Unless we come to this threshold we shall not be able to see the heavenly visions. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJuv_KGLvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> In order to arrive at the threshold in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35423" data-verses="Exodus 24:1">Exodus 24</span>, it was necessary for God’s people to experience all the events recorded in the previous chapters. The people were slaves in Egypt under Pharaoh’s tyranny, but God prepared Moses and then sent him as an apostle to rescue the people. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35424" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">chapter twelve</span> we have the Passover; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35425" data-verses="Exodus 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>, the crossing of the Red Sea; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35426" data-verses="Exodus 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>, the waters at Marah and the twelve springs and seventy palm trees at Elim; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35427" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>, the heavenly manna; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35428" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">chapter seventeen</span>, the living water from the cleft rock and the warfare with Amalek; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35429" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapters nineteen through twenty-three</span>, the decree of the law and of the ordinances at Mount Sinai. God’s people had to pass through all these experiences before they could stand at the threshold in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35430" data-verses="Exodus 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqHzhB-hgkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35431" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapter nineteen</span> the people were brought into fellowship with God at Mount Sinai. However, at first this fellowship was rather obscure, for it took place in the darkness of a thick cloud. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35432" data-verses="Exodus 19:9">Exodus 19:9</span> says, “Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35433" data-verses="Exodus 20:21">20:21</span> says, “Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="937" id="937">[937]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2PzM4YAr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> Although the people were brought into fellowship with God at Mount Sinai, they did not know what kind of God He was, and they did not realize that they were a fallen, sinful, and corrupted people. They did not have the revelation either of God or of themselves. Instead, they had a natural concept of God and also of themselves. But as a result of their stay at Mount Sinai, eventually through their fellowship with God they were enlightened. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7TvJuYWYe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> We have pointed out that when the law of God was enacted, Moses built an altar, and sacrifices were offered with the shedding of blood. This blood, the blood of the covenant, was then used to sprinkle the people. The altar, the sacrifices, and the blood indicate that God regarded His chosen people as having been redeemed, terminated, and replaced. Then, as indicated by the twelve pillars set up by Moses, they could become pillars standing before God to reflect Him as His living testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9Iuo5lJRHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> I do not believe that God’s people had this realization concerning themselves. They did not know the significance of the altar, the sacrifices, the pillars, and the blood. Today when either Jews or Christians read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35434" data-verses="Exodus 24:1">Exodus 24</span>, they are veiled and do not understand the significance of these things. But God had a full understanding of what was taking place. He knew what He had planned and what He was doing through the enactment of the covenant. He realized that He had gained a people who were redeemed, terminated, and replaced to become His living testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGl85BwYfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35435" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:5">1 Corinthians 10:5</span> Paul indicates that the condition of God’s people in the wilderness was actually very poor: “But with most of them God was not well pleased, for they were strewn along in the wilderness.” Nevertheless, when Balak hired the Gentile prophet Balaam to curse the children of Israel, Balaam declared, “He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35436" data-verses="Numbers 23:21">Num. 23:21</span>). Balaam also said, “How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35437" data-verses="Numbers 24:5">Num. 24:5</span>). Balaam had been hired to curse God’s people, but he blessed them <span class="pg" data-page-id="938" id="938">[938]</span> instead. By this we can see that, in the sight of God, His redeemed people were without fault. This should teach us to not speak negatively of the saints. Such negative speaking may be offensive to the Lord. It may seem to us that the condition of the believers in a certain locality is not good, but God regards them as those who have been redeemed, terminated, and replaced. In the eyes of God, all His redeemed people have been terminated by the cross and replaced by Christ and with Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35438" data-verses="Exodus 24:1">Exodus 24</span> we have such a redeemed, terminated, and replaced people. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPZ9XkquJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ">I. THE VISION OF GOD<br/>IN A TRANSPARENT AND CLEAR HEAVEN</h2><p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnCxg-Rr8fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> The scene in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35439" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapter nineteen</span> was dark and threatening. But suddenly, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35440" data-verses="Exodus 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span> the thick cloud passes away, and the sky becomes clear and beautiful. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35441" data-verses="Exodus 24:9-10">Exodus 24:9 and 10</span> say, “Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of transparent sapphire, and as it were the body of heaven in its clearness” (lit.). Beneath God’s feet they saw something that had the appearance of a large transparent stone. Because human words cannot describe this scene, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35442" data-verses="Exodus 24:10">verse 10</span> says that they saw “as it were a paved work of transparent sapphire, and as it were the body of heaven in its clearness.” The words “as it were” indicate that human language cannot adequately describe this marvelous sight. Moses could only liken what they saw under God’s feet to a transparent sapphire stone, which was like the body of heaven in clearness. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJM-y00MaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35443" data-verses="Exodus 24:11">Verse 11</span> goes on to say, “They looked upon God, and did eat and drink” (lit.). While they were looking upon God, they ate and drank. As they experienced a most wonderful sight, they were refreshed by eating and drinking. Those on the mountain saw something no one had ever seen before. God’s redeemed, terminated, and replaced <span class="pg" data-page-id="939" id="939">[939]</span> people were given a wonderful view of Him, even of His feet. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-Dwkx8Mx5qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> To see such a vision of God is to worship Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35444" data-verses="Exodus 24:1">Exodus 24:1</span> says that those who went up the mountain with Moses were to worship afar off. But in the following verses nothing further is said about the worship of God. If we read this chapter carefully and thoughtfully, we shall wonder when they worshipped Him. The worship in this chapter consists of beholding God and of eating and drinking. This is true worship, the worship God desires. God does not want us to worship Him by prostrating ourselves before Him. He wants us to enjoy Him and to worship Him out of this enjoyment. Have you ever been in a chapel or cathedral where the people worshipped God by eating, drinking, rejoicing, and enjoying the Lord? This kind of worship is altogether contrary to our religious concept. Yet this is the worship described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35445" data-verses="Exodus 24:11">verse 11</span>: “They looked upon God, and did eat and drink.” This was the way they worshipped Him. </p>

<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPZ9Hkt9JfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> During the last century and a half, many books have been written on the typology of the tabernacle. The Bible teachers among the Brethren in particular devoted a great deal of time to the study of the tabernacle. Today we stand on the shoulders of those Bible teachers. Although many of the books written on the tabernacle are quite good, there is a great lack in them. For the most part, these books were written from a doctrinal point of view. There is not much emphasis on Christian experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnCxguRtvPiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> In his writings John twice refers to the tabernacle. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35467" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> says that the Word, which is God, became flesh and tabernacled among us. When Christ was in the flesh, He was God’s tabernacle, God’s dwelling place on earth. Prior to Christ’s incarnation, God dwelt in the tabernacle built at Mount Sinai. Then God moved with the tabernacle and later consolidated it with the temple. Thus, the tabernacle and the temple should be regarded as one dwelling place, not two. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJM-i09c6oTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> Centuries before Christ was born, God left the temple and returned to the heavens. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35468" data-verses="Ezekiel 10:1">Ezekiel 10</span> we see that the glory of the Lord left the temple and, in a sense, never returned. Hence, there was a period of several hundred years when God did not dwell on earth. Nevertheless, God did not altogether give up the temple until the Lord Jesus <span class="pg" data-page-id="948" id="948">[948]</span> was rejected by God’s people. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35469" data-verses="Matthew 23:38">Matthew 23:38</span>, the Lord Jesus said, “Behold, your house is left to you desolate.” From that time onward the temple was no longer the house of God; it had become the house of the degraded Israelites. It had been the house of God, but it was now called “your house.” The prophecy that their house would be left to them desolate corresponds to that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35470" data-verses="Matthew 24:2">Matthew 24:2</span>, which was fulfilled when Titus destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-DwkxsM5paQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> The time the Lord Jesus was on earth was a transitional period. Before the temple made with hands was destroyed, Christ was incarnated and became the real tabernacle of God. When Christ came forth to minister, God dwelt in Him, not in a temple made by human hands. One day, the Lord Jesus said, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35471" data-verses="John 2:19">John 2:19</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35472" data-verses="John 2:21">John 2:21</span> says, “He spoke of the temple of His body.” Both the temple made by human hands and the body of Jesus as God’s temple were to be destroyed. This was a transitional period, a time of change from the material temple to Christ as God’s temple. The Lord realized that by His death on the cross, the temple of His body would be destroyed. But on the third day, in His resurrection, He would raise it up again. At that time the tabernacle, the temple, would be enlarged into the church. Therefore, the church today is the tabernacle. Ultimately, this tabernacle will consummate in the New Jerusalem as God’s eternal dwelling place. Concerning the New Jerusalem, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35473" data-verses="Revelation 21:3">Revelation 21:3</span> says, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall tabernacle with them.” The New Jerusalem will be the enlargement of the church, and the church is the enlargement of Christ. Christ is the tabernacle, the church is the enlarged tabernacle, and the New Jerusalem will be the consummate tabernacle. The tabernacle not only typifies Christ as an individual person, but also typifies the church as a corporate dwelling place of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4fkYo07UCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> As we have pointed out, the book of Exodus may be divided into two main parts: the first part consists of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35474" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">chapters one through twenty-four</span>, and the second part, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35475" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">chapters twenty-five through forty</span>. The first twenty-four chapters are <span class="pg" data-page-id="949" id="949">[949]</span> a record of preparation, and the last sixteen chapters are a record of the building of the tabernacle. The first nine verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35476" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span> are crucial. When we begin to read this chapter, we may not pay adequate attention to these verses. We may have little interest in the different materials mentioned. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35477" data-verses="Exodus 25:1-9">25:1-9</span> the emphasis is not on the furniture—the ark, the incense altar, the lampstand, the showbread table, the laver, and the altar—but on the tabernacle. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35478" data-verses="Exodus 25:8">verse 8</span> the Lord says, “And they shall make for Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in their midst.” The sanctuary here is the tabernacle as God’s dwelling place. This sanctuary typifies the church. According to the context, we can see that this sanctuary is not an individual person; rather, it is a corporate people, for God speaks of dwelling “in their midst.” </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP22Zf6BP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> These verses are related to the vision of the tabernacle, not to the vision of the ark. To be sure, the ark typifies the individual Christ. The tabernacle, however, typifies both the individual Christ, the Head, and the corporate Christ, the Body. The New Testament reveals clearly that the individual Christ is the Head. But this Head must have a Body. The Body of Christ is the church. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35479" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22-23">Ephesians 1:22 and 23</span> Paul speaks of the church which is Christ’s Body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. In Exodus we have not only the ark-Christ, but also the tabernacle-Christ, not only the individual Christ, but also the corporate Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2pizkmclAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> If we apply the type of the tabernacle only to Christ individually, everything about it may be objective and doctrinal. There will be very little place for spiritual experience. But if we realize that the vision in Exodus is not merely a vision of Christ as the ark but also of the tabernacle as the enlargement of Christ, the church, we shall realize the need for experience. To repeat, in Exodus we have not only the ark, but also the tabernacle. This means that we have not only Christ, but also the church. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35480" data-verses="Exodus 25:8">25:8</span> God did not say, “They shall make for Me an ark that I may be expressed.” He said, “They shall make for Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in their midst.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="950" id="950">[950]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3r3yJ93EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> It is vital for us to see that the second section of the book of Exodus is concerned with the tabernacle as a type of the church as the enlargement of Christ. In order for Christ to be enlarged into the church, we need to have many spiritual experiences. For this reason, as we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35481" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">chapters twenty-five through forty</span> of Exodus, our emphasis will be more on experience. This certainly does not mean that I reject the doctrinal aspect. The point here is that the emphasis is on Christian experience more than doctrine. My burden is to show that this portion of the Word is full of experiences. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9nBevN2w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> Again and again, I wish to emphasize that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35482" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">chapters twenty-five through forty</span> of Exodus we have a vision of the tabernacle not merely as a type of Christ, but especially as a type of the church, Christ’s enlargement. In order for Christ to have the Body, the church, as His enlargement, we need to have much experience of Christ. If we do not experience Christ, there is no way for Him to be enlarged, to have the Body, or to have the tabernacle as the enlargement of the ark. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC45Wo-H6C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> Both the ark and the standing boards of the tabernacle were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. This indicates that the tabernacle is the enlargement of the ark. In the same principle, the church is the enlargement of Christ. The process by which this enlargement comes into being requires the genuine experience of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTbBBgBDWVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O">I. SEEING THE VISION</h2><p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8ML-1K2xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> Seeing the vision of the tabernacle is a matter of tremendous significance. However, many readers of Exodus have little interest in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35483" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">chapters twenty-five through forty</span>. They may not be concerned with the materials used in building the tabernacle. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m5OKoCMqyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> Moses received the vision of the tabernacle when he was on the mountaintop under the glory of God. God removed the veil, and Moses saw a vision of heavenly things. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35484" data-verses="Hebrews 8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span> says, “Moses was warned when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, He said, that you make all things <span class="pg" data-page-id="951" id="951">[951]</span> according to the pattern that was shown you in the mountain.” In order to see this vision, Moses had to make a journey from Egypt to Mount Sinai. </p>

<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTN9gxVWPtP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> The more I study the book of Exodus, the more I love it. Through my reading of this book, I have discovered that it is a book not only on the exodus, but also on God’s dwelling place. The title of the book—Exodus—was not given by Moses. It was given by others years later. This title is not all-inclusive, for it covers only part of the contents of the book of Exodus. In the first part of this book we are told how God redeemed His people and enabled them to make their exodus out of Egypt and thereby to escape the tyranny of Pharaoh and the slavery under the Egyptians. As far as the first part of the book is concerned, the title Exodus is comprehensive. But although this title is good, it can cause difficulty for many readers, because it may give them the impression that this book is merely concerned with coming out from under the tyranny of Satan. This title does not include the goal, or the consummation, of this book. Consummately, the second book of the Old Testament is on the building of God’s dwelling place on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5RTJlIP0fCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> In this book many of today’s Christians care only for the exodus, not for the building of the tabernacle. In those places where the Scriptures are studied and expounded, can you <span class="pg" data-page-id="960" id="960">[960]</span> hear a message concerning the building of God’s dwelling place on earth in this age? Many believers have the concept that the building of God is in the heavens and only in the future. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FbcHHmbjPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> The book of Exodus has forty chapters, not only fourteen chapters. According to the title of this book, Exodus should conclude with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35503" data-verses="Exodus 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>, after the exodus from Egypt was accomplished and the people were safely on the other side of the sea, dancing and praising the Lord. In the experience of many Christians, the book of Exodus does conclude with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35504" data-verses="Exodus 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>. Before you came into the recovery, how many chapters, according to your experience, were there in the book of Exodus for you? Many Christians have gone only as far as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35505" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">chapter twelve</span>; others, to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35506" data-verses="Exodus 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>; and certain seeking Christians, all the way to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35507" data-verses="Exodus 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span>. The more experienced believers have enjoyed the waters at Elim, the manna from heaven, and the living water from the cleft rock, they have engaged in the warfare against Amalek, and they have been brought into intimate fellowship with God at Mount Sinai. Some Christians do treasure <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35508" data-verses="Exodus 15:1-24">Exodus 15 through 24</span> and have even written hymns to express their experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr86_yTbew6MJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> In this Life-study we have given many messages on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35509" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapters nineteen through twenty-four</span>, chapters which present a complete view of the fellowship between God’s redeemed people and the redeeming God. At the beginning of this fellowship in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35510" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">chapter nineteen</span>, there was a cloud of thick darkness. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35511" data-verses="Exodus 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span> the atmosphere is changed, and the sky becomes clear. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35512" data-verses="Exodus 24:10">Exodus 24:10</span> says, “And they looked upon the God of Israel: and there was under His feet as it were a paved work of transparent sapphire, and as it were the body of heaven in its clearness.” Such a vision was unprecedented. Never before had anyone seen God under a clear and transparent heaven. Here we are told that those on the mountain with Moses not only saw the God of Israel, but that they even saw God’s feet. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJM-S00OaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> At this point I wish to say that we should follow the pure word of the Bible and not the traditional, systematized <span class="pg" data-page-id="961" id="961">[961]</span> teachings concerning the Trinity. We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35513" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span> that Abraham had a wonderful experience with God. God came to Abraham in the form of a man. Abraham served Him a meal and even washed His feet. How could God eat, and how was it possible for a man to wash God’s feet? Is God physical or spiritual? If you say that He is merely spiritual, I would ask how He could appear to Abraham in human form in such a way that Abraham could wash His feet. Some Christians have too much trust in their theological knowledge. Let them explain how God could walk physically on earth in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35514" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span>. Many Christians know that God first took the form of man with the birth of the Lord Jesus. But how should we understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35515" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span>? Did God not appear to Abraham in the form of man? What Abraham saw was not a ghost or a phantom. He talked with a real man and even washed his feet and served him a meal. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-DwkxcMx7qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> The more we consider matters such as these, the more we realize that we are not able to understand thoroughly the revelation in the Bible concerning the Triune God. He is mysterious and wonderful. He is beyond our imagination and cannot be explained adequately by the traditional teachings concerning the Trinity. Instead of trying to systematize the biblical revelation of God, we should simply believe what the Bible says. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35516" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span> tells us that God came to Abraham in the form of man, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35517" data-verses="Luke 2:1">Luke 2</span> we see that the Son of God was born in a manger at Bethlehem. We simply believe the Bible and in the God revealed in it. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNFQ_IHDbKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35518" data-verses="Exodus 24:10">Exodus 24:10</span> we are told explicitly that Moses and those with him on the mountain saw the God of Israel. This sight was marvelous, beyond our ability to describe. They saw God under a transparent and clear sky. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf4g-roqRmndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> We have pointed out that God’s people experienced different degrees of fellowship with the Lord at Mount Sinai. Moses was on the mountaintop under the glory of God; the elders were on the mountain where they beheld the God of Israel; and the majority of the people were at the foot of <span class="pg" data-page-id="962" id="962">[962]</span> the mountain. Because of their immaturity, they were not allowed to ascend the mountain. However, God did not reject them. He brought them into His fellowship, but He required them to keep a certain distance. Only Moses entered into the glory and stayed with God under this glory for forty days and forty nights. What a wonderful fellowship Moses enjoyed with God! </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoaaN7WzqNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> The situation of the children of Israel at Mount Sinai is a portrait of our situation as believers today. We have been redeemed through the Passover, we have made our exodus from Egypt, and we have crossed the Red Sea. We have also had the experiences at Marah and Elim. In the wilderness we have enjoyed the manna and have drunk the living water from the cleft rock. Furthermore, we have engaged in the warfare with Amalek. Many of us can testify that we have been brought to the mountain of God and have entered into fellowship with the Lord. No longer are we in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35519" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">Exodus 19</span> or even in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35520" data-verses="Exodus 20:1-23">Exodus 20 through 23</span>, with the Ten Commandments and the ordinances, which reveal God’s economy. We are enjoying the fellowship with God described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35521" data-verses="Exodus 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span>. However, we need to ask ourselves where we are in this fellowship. Are we with the majority of the people at the foot of the mountain, with the elders on the mountain beholding the Lord under a clear sky, or with Moses on the mountaintop under the glory of God? </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVFjXNEKXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> We have pointed out in a foregoing message that the situation of God’s people at Mount Sinai can be compared to the tabernacle with the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. The people could be in the outer court, but only the priests were permitted access to the Holy Place. Furthermore, only the high priest was allowed to enter into the Holy of Holies to be in the shekinah glory of God and receive His speaking, His revelation. The principle is the same in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35522" data-verses="Exodus 24:1">Exodus 24</span>. The majority of the people were at the foot of the mountain. This can be compared to the outer court of the tabernacle. The elders were on the mountain. This can be compared to the Holy Place. Moses, who was truly functioning as a high priest, was on the mountaintop. <span class="pg" data-page-id="963" id="963">[963]</span> This can be compared to the Holy of Holies. During the forty days and forty nights he stayed under God’s glory, Moses received God’s revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJt5du--Uiqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> Our understanding of the typology of the tabernacle is dependent upon the writings of those who have preceded us. We owe much to them and we are thankful for them. But because we are on their shoulders, we are able to see more than they did, especially concerning the experiential aspect of the tabernacle. </p>

<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneHCNt7MHHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> In the two previous messages we have considered the vision of the tabernacle and its furniture. The children of Israel could see this vision only after they had had the initial experiences of the Passover, the crossing of the Red Sea, Marah and Elim, the enjoyment of manna, the enjoyment of the living water out of the cleft rock, and the war against Amalek. Then the people were brought into fellowship with God at Mount Sinai, where they received the law of God. On the one hand, the law revealed what kind of God our God is. On the other hand, it exposed the people’s fallen, sinful, and corrupt condition. The vision of the tabernacle was given to Moses on the mountaintop when he was staying with God under His glory for forty days and forty nights. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2aQhw1T4UeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> We have pointed out that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35540" data-verses="Exodus 25:1-9">25:1-9</span> three categories of materials are mentioned: minerals, plants, and animals. All the materials refer to the virtues of Christ’s Person and work, and all were presented to God as a heave offering for the building of His dwelling place. Gold, the first of the minerals mentioned, signifies Christ’s divine nature. In this message we shall go on to consider the other minerals, the plants, the animals, and the pattern. <span class="pg" data-page-id="972" id="972">[972]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zPuhamgyXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS">2. Silver, Signifying Christ’s Redemptive Work</h2><p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgVD4vaafwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> Silver, the second of the minerals, signifies Christ’s redemptive work. We should not understand this redemptive work in a superficial way. Redemption involves termination and replacement. We were created by God for Himself and chosen by God to be for Him. However, because we became fallen and lost, we need Christ to redeem us. As fallen creatures, we also need to be terminated. Thus, on the cross Christ crucified us; He terminated us. Furthermore, through His redemption Christ imparts Himself into us to be our replacement. All this—redemption, termination, and replacement—is signified by the silver. The silver testifies that we have been redeemed, terminated, and replaced. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m5OKICMoyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> In our daily life we need to bear the testimony that we are redeemed, terminated, and replaced people. Even the young people in high school should have such a testimony. Others should be able to say, “These young people are very human, but there is something wonderful about them. They are special in a way that I find difficult to explain.” The more we are replaced by Christ, the more wonderful we shall be. Praise the Lord that Christ has redeemed us and terminated us and that He is now in the process of replacing us! This is the experience of Christ as our silver. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh02_qmOovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> When we experience Christ as silver and possess Him in this way as our treasure, we should bring this treasure to the church meetings. Then as we function by releasing our spirit, we should offer to God in worship the silver we have gained, enjoyed, and experienced. This is the kind of worship God desires. He does not want us to prostrate ourselves before Him, and He does not want to listen to the performance of a choir. The worship which is acceptable to God is worship in which we offer to Him as a heave offering the Christ we have experienced and possessed. Such worship will not only be acceptable to God; it will also build up the saints. Meeting by meeting, we all need to be built up in this way. <span class="pg" data-page-id="973" id="973">[973]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-2C9UYe189qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS">3. Bronze, Signifying<br/>the Testing of God’s Judgment</h2><p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB5DJifIi6RI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> Bronze signifies the testing of God’s judgment. Christ as a man was tested again and again. He was tested throughout His life on earth, and He was tested when He stood before the priests, Herod, and Pilate to be tried and sentenced to death. Moreover, Christ was tested by God. Every day of His life Christ was under God’s testing. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZdyT8-FcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> In typology bronze signifies the testing of God’s judgment. This is the reason the altar in the outer court was built with bronze instead of gold. The altar is a means and a place of testing. As such, it typifies the cross as both the means and the place where we are tested by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-ROAcLxIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> The brass serpent lifted up on a pole in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35541" data-verses="Numbers 21:9">Numbers 21:9</span> was a type of Christ as the One who was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin and lifted up on the cross to be judged by God. Just as the serpent was lifted up on the pole, Christ was lifted up on the cross to be tested by God. In every way He stood God’s test and passed through it. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cB1hOlTYxWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> Daily we also are under God’s testing. The kind of life we have at home, at work, and at school is subject to God’s test. What a brother says to his wife will be tested by God, and the attitude of a young person toward his teachers and classmates at school will also be tested. God will even test our motives, intentions, and all that is in our heart. As we experience God’s testing, we gain not only gold and silver, but also bronze. This causes us to be a different kind of person, a person who is not careless about the way he behaves, speaks, and expresses his attitudes. A person who experiences the bronze is a person under the cross, under God’s test. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTq5eAE4AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> Under God’s testing, a young person may be examined by Him when he is about to say or do a certain thing at school. A brother will also experience God’s testing in relation to his wife. Suppose he intends to say a strong word to her. At that point the Lord may test him, and he will realize that he should not utter such a word. Instead of saying a negative word to his wife, the brother may say a positive word to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="974" id="974">[974]</span> Lord, telling Him, “Lord, how wise and how good You are! I love You, Lord, and I love my family.” Through such an experience, the brother will gain some experience of bronze. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8636qzFcZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> First we should gain bronze from our daily experience with the Lord. Then we should bring it to the meetings and, as we function by exercising our spirit, offer it to the Lord as a heave offering. This bronze, experienced and possessed by us, is also material used for the building of God’s tabernacle. </p>

Onyx Stone, Signifying Christ’s<br/>Redemptive Work as the Base<br/>for the Spirit’s Transforming Work</h2><p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbACPdgL7nhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> The onyx stone mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35542" data-verses="Exodus 25:7">25:7</span> was red in color. This onyx stone signifies Christ’s blood shed for redemption as a base for the Spirit’s transforming work. Christ’s redemption is the basis for the transforming work of the Holy Spirit. </p>

The experience of the onyx is the basis for the experience of the other precious stones. As we have pointed out, this means that Christ’s redemption is the foundation for the transforming work of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l3CEgDOsl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> We all need to experience the Spirit’s transformation. For example, we need to love our parents, relatives, neighbors, and especially the brothers and sisters in the church. God, however, does not accept our natural love. In His sight, our natural love is clay, not precious stones. We may feel very positively about our natural love, but to God it is loathsome and uncomely. Our love needs to be transformed. We need a love that is transformed by the Spirit with Christ’s redemption, termination, and replacement as the basis. Then we shall love others with a pure love, a love which is the product of the precious transforming work of the Holy Spirit. To love others in this way is very different from loving them in a natural way. <span class="pg" data-page-id="975" id="975">[975]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBovj7xMlB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> We should not be satisfied with our natural morality, ethics, character, or behavior. All these things need to be transformed. First we must be redeemed, terminated, and replaced and then transformed metabolically by the Holy Spirit. This is the experience of the precious stones. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_BssDj-r8k5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> If we bring these precious materials to the meetings of the church and offer them to God as a heave offering, we shall help to build the church as God’s dwelling place. Then our meetings will be filled with the offering of such precious materials and a wonderful work of building will take place among us. </p>

<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4fkZ408GiuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35556" data-verses="Exodus 25:10">Exodus 25:10</span> says, “And they shall make an ark of acacia wood.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35557" data-verses="Exodus 25:22">verse 22</span>, this ark was called “the ark of the testimony.” In the book of Exodus the testimony refers to the law. God regarded the law decreed through Moses on Mount Sinai as His testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP23Jf8T_8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> The photograph of a person is a testimony of that person. Suppose I have never met a certain brother. When someone shows me a photograph of that brother, I see a testimony of what that brother is like. As a description of the brother, his photograph is his testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2pjjkvOlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> We know from the first chapter of Genesis that in His work of creation God accomplished many things. However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35558" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> does not reveal what kind of God our God is. We do not know from this chapter whether He is a God of love or of hate, a God of darkness or of light. We do not know whether He is holy or common, righteous or unrighteous. The law was given that we might have a portrait, a description, of God and thereby understand what He is. For this reason, God considers the law as His testimony. As a testimony of God, the law is a type of Christ. Christ is the living portrait of God, His living definition and description. Therefore, Christ is the real testimony of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3r2iJ1lUyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> Just as Christ is the testimony of God, so the church is the testimony of Christ. The church is a portrait, a picture, of Christ and is therefore the testimony of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTN9hRVRdNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> We have seen that the ark is called the ark of testimony or the ark of the testimony. The meaning is the same <span class="pg" data-page-id="984" id="984">[984]</span> whether or not the definite article is used. Furthermore, the tabernacle is called the tabernacle of the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35559" data-verses="Exodus 38:21">38:21</span>), because the testimony is in the ark, and the ark is in the tabernacle. In these messages on the last sixteen chapters of Exodus, when we speak of the ark of the testimony or the tabernacle of the testimony, we should understand that the word testimony refers to the law. However, it refers to the law as a definition of God, not as commandments for people to keep. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5RSplOdEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> In the messages on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35560" data-verses="Exodus 19:1-2">Exodus 19 and 20</span> we emphasized the fact that, contrary to the concept of both Jews and Christians, the law was given not for us to keep, but to reveal what kind of God our God is. As the testimony of God, the law is indeed lovable. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35561" data-verses="Romans 7:12">Romans 7:12</span> says, “So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35562" data-verses="Romans 7:14">Romans 7:14</span> Paul says that “the law is spiritual.” The law is holy, just, good, and spiritual because it is a portrait of God. We should love the law because it is a picture of our God. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FbcGnmSxPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> God’s testimony, the law, was placed in the ark for safekeeping. The ark can be compared to a safe used to keep important documents or personal valuables. In the tabernacle of the testimony there was a “safe,” a box, where the law, God’s testimony, was kept. Thus, the ark of the testimony was a divine safe for the preservation of God’s “photograph.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr86_yS7e4ocJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s">I. THE FIRST ITEM OF THE FURNITURE<br/>OF THE TABERNACLE</h2><p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjrbcNXOmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> The ark of the testimony was the first item of the furniture of the tabernacle. The tabernacle had a number of important furnishings: the altar and the laver in the outer court; the showbread table, the lampstand, and the incense altar in the Holy Place; and the ark in the Holy of Holies, the inmost chamber of the tabernacle. The first of these furnishings was the ark. As the first item, it occupied the place of preeminence. We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35563" data-verses="Exodus 40:2-3">40:2 and 3</span> that it was in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="985" id="985">[985]</span> tabernacle, and from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35564" data-verses="Exodus 40:20-21">40:20 and 21</span>, that it was in the Holy of Holies. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPDyqTasYW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> To have a proper understanding of the tabernacle with its furnishings, we should have clearly in mind a diagram of the tabernacle including the altar and laver in the outer court, the showbread table, the lampstand, and the incense altar in the Holy Place, and the ark in the Holy of Holies. We need to have a clear understanding of the location of each item in relation to the tabernacle. </p>

<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36YA1LLPBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> The ark, the incense altar, the showbread table, and the lampstand are all types of Christ. Christ has many aspects, and these four items show forth different aspects of Him. As a type of Christ, the ark typifies Christ as the embodiment of God’s testimony. Christ is the embodiment of God. The ark as the embodiment of God’s testimony typifies Christ as the embodiment of God. All that God is, is embodied in Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35565" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Colossians 2:9</span> says that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. Our use of the word embodiment is based on this verse. Because God is embodied in Christ, He is portrayed, defined, and explained by Christ. Christ is God’s definition, His explanation. As God’s testimony, Christ is typified by the ark of the testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0ByB29JYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35566" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Colossians 2:9</span> we have a clear statement saying that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. With the ark of the testimony we have a picture, a type, which corresponds to this direct statement. In teaching children to read, a teacher often shows a picture of an object with the word identifying it underneath. For example, there may be a picture of an airplane, and underneath the picture the word “airplane.” In the Bible we have both pictures and words. Concerning Christ as the embodiment of God’s testimony, we have the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35567" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Colossians 2:9</span> and the picture of the ark in the book of Exodus. <span class="pg" data-page-id="986" id="986">[986]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneHCMd7IVnXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM">B. For God’s Redeemed People<br/>to Contact Him and Enjoy Him</h2><p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2aRRwwBIUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> God is in Christ. Apart from Christ we cannot meet God. Not only is God in Christ, but Christ Himself actually is God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35568" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> says that the Word, which is Christ, was with God and was God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35569" data-verses="Romans 9:5">Romans 9:5</span> Paul says that Christ is God blessed forever. Jesus, a carpenter from Nazareth, was the very God over all and blessed forever. The only way for us to contact God and enjoy Him is through Christ and in Christ. The ark as a type of Christ indicates that God’s redeemed people can contact God and enjoy God in Christ and through Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zPvRasyyXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> Because the Jews do not contact God in Christ, they do not have genuine contact with God, and they certainly do not enjoy God, even though they may worship Him. It is doubtful that today’s Jews even have the concept of enjoying God. Instead, they emphasize fearing God, worshipping God, exalting God, and adoring God. They may wonder how we can speak of contacting God and enjoying Him. But the New Testament reveals that God has come in Christ that we may contact Him, receive Him, and enjoy Him. As the ark of the testimony, Christ is for us to contact God and enjoy God. </p>

<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wN7t23J_Pl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> If we look at a diagram of the tabernacle, we may wonder how it is possible to say that the ark of the testimony is the center of the tabernacle of testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35570" data-verses="Exodus 38:21">38:21</span>). But in the Bible it is the inmost part of something which is regarded as the center. For example, although our heart is not located at the exact center of our body, we nonetheless regard it as being in the center. Likewise, because the Holy of Holies is in the inmost part of the tabernacle, it is the center of the tabernacle. It is the focus of the tabernacle and signifies the center of God’s dwelling place. God dwelt in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="987" id="987">[987]</span> tabernacle but not in the outer court or in the Holy Place. He dwelt in the Holy of Holies. The ark in the Holy of Holies signifies the center of God’s dwelling place, the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35571" data-verses="Ephesians 2:21-22">Eph. 2:21-22</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4Soq-KjKTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> The cover of the ark is equal to the throne of grace in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35572" data-verses="Hebrews 4:16">Hebrews 4:16</span>. It was upon the cover of the ark, the throne of grace, that God dwelt. This was the exact place where God was. In the Old Testament this place was in the tabernacle of the testimony. But in the New Testament this place is in the church. The church today is God’s tabernacle, His dwelling place. </p>

<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-2C80YZn89qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> The last sixteen chapters of Exodus are a test of whether or not we truly have a heart seeking after God’s economy. In their reading of the Bible many Christians skip over these chapters after they have read the book of Exodus through once or twice. They may prefer the stories in Genesis and in the first chapters of Exodus to all the details related to the tabernacle and its furnishings recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35584" data-verses="Exodus 25:1-40">Exodus 25 through 40</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB5DICfOwqRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> We have pointed out that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35585" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">Colossians 1:25</span>, Paul’s ministry was a completing ministry. The revelation given to Paul was the completion of the Word of God. Actually the last sixteen chapters of Exodus are closely related to the completing ministry of Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZdzz83W8JlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35586" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">Exodus 1</span> to 24 is mainly concerned with history. However, God’s concern in this book is not with history—it is with the tabernacle. The tabernacle and all its furniture are a type of Christ and the church, including many details of the church life. Because the spiritual significance of the types in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35587" data-verses="Exodus 25:1-40">Exodus 25 through 40</span> is deep and mysterious, they have been neglected by many in today’s organized religion. The revelation in these chapters brings us into the depths and also into the details of Christ and the church. The writings which make up the heart of the divine revelation in the New Testament—Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians—are brief, but they are profound and unfathomable. Deep and profound matters related to Christ and the church are also found in the last sixteen chapters of Exodus. <span class="pg" data-page-id="996" id="996">[996]</span> For this reason we need a seeking heart when we come to this portion of the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-RPgcDi4s4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> In this message on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35588" data-verses="Exodus 25:12-16">25:12-16</span> we shall consider the rings and the poles of the ark of the testimony. However, before coming to these matters, I would like to say a further word about the rim of gold which was made round about the ark (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35589" data-verses="Exodus 25:11">v. 11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8637KzFeZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35590" data-verses="Exodus 25:11">Exodus 25:11</span> says, “And you shall make upon it a rim of gold round about.” Instead of the word “rim,” some versions say “wreath” or “crown.” In the previous message we pointed out that the rim of gold around the ark signifies the glory of the divine nature, and that the glory of the divine nature as a rim signifies the divine keeping power and holding strength. It is significant that concerning this rim no measurements are given. In typology anything that does not have a measurement refers to something eternal, immeasurable, unlimited, and inexhaustible. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35591" data-verses="Exodus 25:11">Verse 11</span> does not tell us how high or how wide the rim was. This verse simply speaks of a rim of gold. We have seen that acacia wood signifies Christ’s humanity with its character and standard and that gold signifies His divinity. Although the ark was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold, the rim upon the ark was made only of gold. This rim thus signifies the glory of the divine nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIOOaIRj-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> Christ as the embodiment of God’s testimony has glory. He is the effulgence of God’s glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35592" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">Heb. 1:3</span>). When the Lord Jesus was on earth, outwardly He was a despised Nazarene, One without form or comeliness. But not even those who opposed Him could deny the fact that there was a wonderful and glorious expression with Him. This was the divine nature lived out of Him. Through the Lord’s human life the divine nature was expressed as a wreath, or crown, of glory. As you consider the record of the Lord’s life in the four Gospels, you will realize that in His living, glory was expressed. This glory was not human, something of wood; it was divine, something of gold. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbACO9gI7HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> The glory of the divine nature as a rim signifies the divine keeping power and holding strength. With Christ as <span class="pg" data-page-id="997" id="997">[997]</span> the embodiment of God’s testimony, there is a keeping power and a holding strength. Peter, James, John, and others were kept, held, and preserved by the rim of glory upon Christ. Because of his weakness, Peter denied the Lord. In the end, however, his denial was actually a proof that he believed in the Lord Jesus and loved Him, for afterwards Peter went out and wept bitterly. Peter had seen the expression of God’s glory in the Lord Jesus on the mount of transfiguration. That expression of divine glory was the holding power and the keeping strength which preserved Peter. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0SYzMJujsWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> We also are kept by this holding power and keeping strength. The expressed glory of the Lord’s divinity can keep us from falling. If we live Christ at home and at work, the very Christ whom we live will become the glory expressed through us. This glory, this expression, will become a rim that holds us and keeps us. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYFBTIJBazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> In Philippians Paul expected that, whether through life or through death, Christ would be magnified in his body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35593" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">1:20</span>). Because Paul lived Christ and magnified Him, no one would presume to suggest that he join them in worldly entertainments. The glory expressed through his humanity was a rim that held Paul and kept him. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l3DkgAPMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> Although our experience is very limited compared to Paul’s, many of us can testify that we have been held and kept by the rim of the expressed glory of God. Our relatives and friends may not dare to speak to us about worldly things. This is an indication that upon us we have a golden rim, the rim of the ark of God’s testimony. In our daily living we all should have this rim upon us. </p>

Far from being stationary, this testimony should be able to move. The book of Acts is a record of the acts, or the move, of Christ. There was a move of Christ from Jerusalem to Judea, to <span class="pg" data-page-id="998" id="998">[998]</span> Samaria, and then on to the uttermost part of the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35594" data-verses="Acts 1:8">Acts 1:8</span>). In Acts the Christ we see is not the incarnated Christ, the Christ who walked on earth in a human body. Rather, we see the Christ who was crucified and resurrected, and who has ascended to the heavens and descended on His Body as the life-giving Spirit. Acts records the move of such a Christ in and through His Body. If we would have an adequate understanding of the four rings of gold and the two poles, we need to make a thorough study of the entire book of Acts. In Acts we have a description of the rings and the poles; that is, we have an account of the move on earth of Christ as God’s testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GsZl6fvZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> The ark was made at Mount Sinai, but it did not remain there. The ark was built in such a way that it could be moved. According to the book of Numbers, the children of Israel carried the ark and marched like an army. In order for the ark to be moved, it had to have the four rings and two poles. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQa8RNszyAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35595" data-verses="Exodus 25:12">Exodus 25:12</span> says, “And you shall cast for it four rings of gold and put them upon its four feet, two rings upon its one side, and two rings upon its second side.” In typology a golden ring signifies the eternal Spirit. Four rings of gold signify that the divine nature of Christ is the linking factor and power. Elsewhere we have pointed out that a gold ring signifies the Spirit with whom we have been sealed. Because a ring has no beginning or ending, it signifies the eternal Spirit. These rings made of gold, the divine nature of Christ, signify the linking factor and power. Without the rings, there would have been no way to hold the ark. There would have been no link, no connection. The life-giving eternal Spirit signified by the rings is the linking factor and power. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755X5_DLg8djlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv">A. Being Cast</h2><p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGnCzw5B-PzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35596" data-verses="Exodus 25:12">Verse 12</span> says that the rings were cast. They were not made of beaten work. The casting of the rings signifies that the eternal life-giving Spirit becomes the linking power through the experience of the cross. Being cast signifies <span class="pg" data-page-id="999" id="999">[999]</span> tests which come through suffering. The more we experience the cross, the more the life-giving eternal Spirit will be cast to become the golden rings. Then we shall have strong rings for the move of God’s testimony. </p>

<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYFBjIOS6zJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> In the two foregoing messages we considered the materials of the ark, the dimensions of the ark, and the rim of gold around the top of the ark. We have also considered the four rings of gold and the two poles used for the move of the ark. In this message we shall consider from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35617" data-verses="Exodus 25:17-22">25:17-22</span> the propitiatory cover which was put on the ark. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l3DUgGc8l6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD">X. THE PROPITIATORY COVER</h2><p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBouz77fFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35618" data-verses="Exodus 25:17">Exodus 25:17</span> says, “And you shall make a propitiatory cover of pure gold, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its width.” This propitiatory cover was the lid of the ark. In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament made before the time of Christ) the word <em>hilasterion</em> is used to translate the Hebrew word for propitiatory cover. This Greek word is a noun form of the Greek verb <em>hilaskomai. Hilaskomai</em> means to appease, to reconcile two parties by satisfying the demand of one upon the other, that is, to propitiate. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35619" data-verses="Hebrews 2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span>, the Lord Jesus made propitiation for our sins to reconcile us to God by satisfying God’s righteous demands on us. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_BstTj14Mk5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> Suppose a certain party is indebted to another party. However, he is not able to fulfill the demands of the second party. There seems to be no way to settle this problem. Then a third party comes on the scene and, on behalf of the first party, fulfills the requirements of the second party, thus appeasing the second party. In this way, the first party is reconciled to the second, for the demands of the second party <span class="pg" data-page-id="1008" id="1008">[1008]</span> have been satisfied. The Greek word <em>hilaskomai</em> refers to such a transaction in which reconciliation is brought about through the appeasement of a particular party and the satisfaction of his requirement. Christ has reconciled us to God by satisfying God’s demands on us. </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36YAVLLNBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> The Greek word for propitiation, <em>hilasterion,</em> is different from <em>hilasmos</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35620" data-verses="1John 2:2">1 John 2:2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35621" data-verses="1John 4:10">4:10</span>. <em>Hilasmos</em> denotes that which propitiates, that is, a propitiatory sacrifice. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35622" data-verses="1John 2:2">1 John 2:2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35623" data-verses="1John 4:10">4:10</span>, the Lord Jesus is the propitiatory sacrifice for our sins. Christ is not only the One who reconciles us to God by fulfilling God’s requirements and appeasing Him, but He is also the propitiatory sacrifice. He sacrificed Himself that we may be reconciled to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0Byh29LYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> We have seen that Christ is the One who makes propitiation to God for us as well as the One who is the propitiatory sacrifice. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35624" data-verses="Romans 3:25">Romans 3:25</span> Paul says that Christ is our propitiation-cover. God has set forth Christ to be our <em>hilasterion,</em> our propitiatory cover. This means that as the <em>hilasterion</em> Christ is also the very place where God is able to meet with us, His redeemed people, and talk to us. Therefore, Christ is the One who propitiates, He is the propitiatory sacrifice, and He is the propitiatory cover, the place where God and His redeemed people meet together. </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneHCM97LVHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> As the propitiatory sacrifice and as the One who has made propitiation to God on our behalf, Christ is also the place, called the propitiation-cover in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35625" data-verses="Romans 3:25">Romans 3:25</span>, where we can meet with God. The Septuagint uses <em>hilasterion</em> for the lid, or cover, of the ark. Paul uses this word to refer to Christ as the propitiation-cover. No doubt, when Paul was writing <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35626" data-verses="Romans 3:25">Romans 3:25</span> he had in mind a picture of the propitiatory cover placed on the ark of the testimony. (See note 25<sup>l</sup> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35627" data-verses="Romans 3:1">Romans 3</span>, Recovery Version.) </p>
<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2aRxwzBoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> As we study the description of the propitiatory cover in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35628" data-verses="Exodus 25:17-22">Exodus 25:17-22</span> and seek to understand its significance for our spiritual experience, we need to receive light through the Word and not mere knowledge. Our goal in reading the Bible should be to receive light and not simply to gain objective knowledge. Therefore, we need to guard against <span class="pg" data-page-id="1009" id="1009">[1009]</span> unnecessary questionings and thoughts which interfere with the shining of the light through the Word. On the one hand, we need to ask meaningful questions concerning what we read in the Bible. On the other hand, we need to avoid useless questions, questions which have no answers. When we read the account of the propitiatory cover in Exodus, we may be snared by such questions. For example, some may ask if the cherubim on the ark are angels. Others may want to know the weight of the cherubim or how many faces they have. Some may try to figure out the thickness of the propitiatory cover, realizing that the length and the width are given, but not the thickness. Some readers may ask if the cherubim and the lid of the ark were all one piece of gold. Other readers may wonder how the cherubim can have their faces toward each other and also toward the lid of the ark. In this message we shall not be concerned with questions such as these. Rather, our aim is to consider those matters crucial for our spiritual understanding and experience. Thus, we come to these verses not to find answers to unnecessary questions, but to obtain light from the Lord. </p>

It also signifies Him as the place where God speaks to His redeemed people in grace. Hence, the propitiatory cover equals God’s throne of grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35629" data-verses="Hebrews 4:16">Heb. 4:16</span>). </p>

We do not know whether or not the cherubim are angels, but we do know that they are related to God’s glory. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35634" data-verses="Hebrews 9:5">Hebrews 9:5</span> speaks of the cherubim of glory, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35635" data-verses="Ezekiel 10:18">Ezekiel 10:18</span> says that God’s glory left the temple and stood above the cherubim. Thus, the cherubim are related to God’s glory and signify His glory. The cherubim on the propitiatory cover indicate that Christ expresses God’s glory, that God’s glory shines out from Him. The cherubim were on the cover, and the cover is Christ. This means that the glory of God shines out of Christ and upon Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4fkZY04UiuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> The cherubim were made of gold, of Christ’s divine nature, and they were made of beaten work, indicating Christ’s sufferings. </p>

The fact that the cherubim were one with the propitiatory cover indicates that God’s glory comes out of Christ being the propitiatory cover to be a testimony. </p>

This means that God’s glory is expressed in Christ to be a full testimony. The faces of the cherubim were toward each other and toward the propitiatory cover. This signifies that God’s glory watches over and observes what Christ has done. </p>

<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2Py84fSr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> In our study of the tabernacle and its furnishings, we are concerned not merely to know the types in a doctrinal way, but to apply the types to our spiritual experience. In this message and in the next two messages I am burdened to speak a further word on the propitiatory cover. We have seen that the propitiatory cover signifies Christ as the cover of God’s righteous law and also the place where God speaks to His redeemed people in grace. This cover is made of pure gold, signifying Christ’s divine nature, and its size signifies a testimony. Furthermore, the two golden cherubim on the propitiatory cover signify God’s glory and indicate that God’s glory comes out of Christ as the propitiatory cover to be a testimony. In the foregoing message we emphasized the fact that God meets with His redeemed people and speaks with them in the propitiating Christ. He speaks to them from between the two cherubim, indicating that He speaks to His people from the glory expressed in the propitiating Christ as His testimony. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7TvIeYQKO1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-">THE CHRIST WHO DWELLS IN OUR SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9IupJlACnJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> We have pointed out that the ark of the testimony was in the inmost part of the tabernacle. The tabernacle was surrounded by the outer court. There were two sections in the tabernacle—the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies may be likened to our deepest part, our spirit. The Holy of Holies is the deepest part of the tabernacle, and in this deepest part the ark occupies the central place. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1020" id="1020">[1020]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGl9JB4LvVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> Just as we are tripartite, composed of body, soul, and spirit, so the tabernacle with the outer court is composed of three parts. The outer court corresponds to our body; the Holy Place, to our soul; and the Holy of Holies, to our spirit. The ark of testimony in the Holy of Holies signifies the Christ who dwells in our spirit. Christ, the resurrected One, lives as the indwelling Spirit in our regenerated spirit. Actually, this message is not an exposition on the propitiatory covering. Rather, it is a word concerning the Christ who lives in our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GsZF6ftZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> You may be familiar with Paul’s word, “The Lord be with your spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35651" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">2 Tim. 4:22</span>), and you may have had some experience of the Christ who dwells within you. But do you know what kind of Christ lives in you? He is wonderful and all-inclusive. However, if we have never been enlightened concerning the ark of the testimony, and if we have not had a vision of the ark as a type of Christ with its significance for our experience, we do not have adequate knowledge of the Christ who is in our spirit. We may know the terminology and the verses which speak of Christ dwelling in us, but we may not actually know who is the Christ and what is the Christ who dwells in our spirit. If we would know this Christ, we need a vision of the ark of the testimony. In particular, we need to be enlightened with respect to the propitiatory cover. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQa8RtszwAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg">GOD’S TESTIMONY</h2><p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755X5_jLj89jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> The ark is a box in the shape of a stand. We have seen that the ark typifies Christ. The very Christ who is in our spirit is the ark, and this ark is a stand. In the Bible any stand or standing implies a testimony. To take a stand is to testify. As the ark, Christ is God’s testimony. He stands as the testimony of God in our spirit and in the whole universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGnCTw6BePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> Because the ark is a box, a container, it has a particular content. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35652" data-verses="Exodus 25:21">Exodus 25:21</span> says, “Into the ark you shall put the testimony which I shall give you.” This testimony, the tables of the law, can be considered a photograph, a portrait, of God. Hence, the content of Christ as the ark is the law as a <span class="pg" data-page-id="1021" id="1021">[1021]</span> portrait, a photograph, a definition, of God. Later, the golden pot with manna and Aaron’s budding rod were also put into the ark. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJuuPKGKvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY">THE GOD-MAN</h2><p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqHzgx-hhkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> We have seen that the ark was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. The acacia wood and the gold typify the two natures of Christ: the gold typifies His divine nature, and the acacia wood, His human nature. Both within and without, the ark was overlaid with gold. This indicates that Christ is divine, that He is God. However, He is not only God, but also a man. Therefore, Christ is a God-man. The gold-wood ark typifies Christ as the God-man. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2Py84YBr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> It is a mark of blindness and foolishness to oppose the truth that Christ is a God-man. Certain of our opposers seem to pay attention only to the gold of the ark, only to Christ’s divinity. They do not pay adequate attention to the fact that the ark is made of wood overlaid with gold, to the fact that Christ is truly the God-man. We most assuredly believe that Christ is God. But we realize that just as the ark was made of wood overlaid with gold, so Christ has a human nature within His divine nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7TvIeYWZe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> In time to come, more believers will realize that, as the One typified by the ark made of wood overlaid with gold, Christ is the God-man. The truth will go out, and it will convince, subdue, and enlighten. We praise the Lord for this. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9IupJlJSHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> As the God-man, the One who possesses both the divine nature and the human nature, Christ is both the Creator and a creature. Several years ago some who oppose this truth declared, “Our Christ is the Creator—He is not a creature.” What blindness! The Bible says clearly that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35653" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Col. 1:15</span>). Because Christ is all-inclusive, He is the first of the creatures and He is the Creator of all. If Christ were only God and not man, only the Creator and not a creature, He would not be all-inclusive. He would not be the reality of all positive things in the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGl9JBwbfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> Eventually, either in this age or in the coming age, all <span class="pg" data-page-id="1022" id="1022">[1022]</span> those who oppose today will come to believe that Christ is all-inclusive. In eternity we all shall know that Christ is God and man, the Creator and the creature, for He is the ark made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPZ8nkpvpfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ">THE TOPMOST PART OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnCxhORo9_iyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> The most crucial part of the ark of the testimony was its cover. Many buildings in ancient times had something called a topstone, or capstone. The cover of the ark was like a capstone of a building. The propitiatory cover of the ark signifies the topmost part of Christ. The Hebrew word for cover here means a lid. Most translators, however, do not regard the word lid as an adequate rendering, for they realize that this cover is not simple in its significance. For example, there were two cherubim on the lid, the cover, of the ark. Although no one can describe these cherubim, we know that they had faces, eyes, and wings. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35654" data-verses="Exodus 25:20">Exodus 25:20</span> says, “And the cherubim shall spread out their wings above, covering over with their wings the propitiatory cover, with their faces each toward the other; toward the propitiatory cover the faces of the cherubim shall be.” The cherubim were made at the two ends of the propitiatory cover, and their wings covered the entire lid. The cherubim were made of beaten work, signifying that Christ’s expression of the divine glory was through sufferings. According to the Bible, these cherubim signify God’s glory. Wherever the cherubim are, there the glory of God is also. Thus, the picture of the propitiatory cover with the cherubim shows that God’s glory, signified by the cherubim, is upon Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJM_C03O6oTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> In verses such as these, it is necessary to have an accurate translation to obtain the proper understanding. However, it is not easy to translate the Bible. Do not think that simply because a person has a scholarly knowledge of biblical languages he is qualified to translate the Bible properly. To translate the Bible accurately we must know the truth of the Bible as a whole and we should also have experience in the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-DwkwMMy7KQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> According to the truth of the Bible, blood was sprinkled <span class="pg" data-page-id="1023" id="1023">[1023]</span> on the propitiatory cover of the ark. This blood came from the sacrifices offered on the brass altar in the outer court for propitiation, sacrifices to make peace between sinners and God. The blood of these sacrifices was brought into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled seven times on the propitiatory cover. No doubt, at least a large area of the lid was covered by the sprinkled blood. As a result, the golden lid was eventually covered with blood. The ark in this way became a place of propitiation for man with God. </p>

In the foregoing message we saw that the ark with the propitiatory cover sprinkled by the redeeming blood is a portrait of the Christ who dwells in our spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVFh3NCZne1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2">OPENING THE WAY<br/>TO THE TREE OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJt5fO-3Hiqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> Although the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35657" data-verses="Exodus 25:17-22">25:17-22</span> is brief, it involves a lengthy historical background. For the fulfillment of His eternal purpose, God created the heavens and the earth with man as the center. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35658" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">Zechariah 12:1</span>, the Lord stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. The spirit of man is the organ to receive God and contain Him. Because God’s intention is to dispense Himself into man, man needs a spirit in order to receive God. </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRA3IKguxmTX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> Before God dispensed Himself into man’s spirit, Satan intervened to inject himself into the man created by God. When man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan entered into man. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35659" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans chapters five</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35660" data-verses="Romans 6:1">six</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35661" data-verses="Romans 7:1">seven</span>, indwelling sin refers to Satan who injected himself into man. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35662" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Romans 5:12</span> says, “Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin; and so death passed to all men because all have sinned.” The tree <span class="pg" data-page-id="1028" id="1028">[1028]</span> of life in the garden indicates that God’s intention is to dispense Himself into man to be man’s life. However, God knew that His enemy would act first to work himself into man. Satan as this evil source is indicated by another tree, called the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. When man ate of this tree, he was poisoned by Satan. In fact, Satan became the sinful nature of fallen man. Because man had fallen by eating of the tree of knowledge, God closed the way to the tree of life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35663" data-verses="Genesis 3:24">Genesis 3:24</span> says, “So he drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.” </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4Srq-JiqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> In the book of Revelation we once again read of the tree of life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35664" data-verses="Revelation 2:7">Revelation 2:7</span> the Lord Jesus makes this declaration: “To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35665" data-verses="Revelation 22:2">Revelation 22:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35666" data-verses="Revelation 22:14">14</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35667" data-verses="Revelation 22:19">19</span> also speak of the tree of life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35668" data-verses="Revelation 22:14">Verse 14</span> says, “Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life.” All these verses indicate that something has happened to open the way to the tree of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj9M73HIH4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> Who opened the way? How was the way opened, and when? In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35669" data-verses="Hebrews 10:19-20">Hebrews 10:19 and 20</span> we have the answer to these questions: “Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh.” The living way, the way to the tree of life, has been opened by the blood of Jesus. This opened way has now become the new and living way for us to come into the Holy of Holies. Therefore, through the redeeming blood of Christ we can once again enjoy the tree of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_bdzF28SNcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> A certain well-known Bible teacher has said that the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil were both unusual trees, but that he could not say much about these trees because they are no longer in existence. According to this Bible teacher, these two trees have been removed from the scene. But according to the Bible, the tree of life will exist for eternity. Nineteen hundred years ago, when the Lord put forth the epistles to the seven churches, He <span class="pg" data-page-id="1029" id="1029">[1029]</span> promised that the overcomers would be given to eat of the tree of life. If this tree were no longer in existence, if it had been removed from the scene, how would it be possible for the overcomers to eat of it? How could all the believers have access to it in the New Jerusalem? </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vVnRtrhF6d_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> Many believers today have religion, ethics, and morality. But in their experience they do not have the tree of life. As far as they are concerned, it seems that the tree of life does not exist. Hallelujah, we have the tree of life, and we eat of this tree and enjoy it! We praise the Lord for the new and living way back to the tree of life through the redeeming blood of Christ. If we would properly appreciate the Christ who lives in us, we need to understand this historical background. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4fka407VCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS">ENJOYING CHRIST AS THE ARK<br/>IN THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2><p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP20Jf6AP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> Suppose a person who is a typical sinner one day hears the gospel, repents, confesses his sinful deeds, and believes in the Lord Jesus. After he repents, confesses, and believes, God meets with him, and he with God. Furthermore, Christ comes into him as the One typified by the ark with all its aspects. When Christ died on the cross, He was the Lamb for redemption. But when He comes into a believer’s spirit, He comes not only as the Lamb, but also as the ark. Today, due to their limited understanding and the inadequacy of much gospel preaching, most Christians only realize that Christ is the Lamb. Very few know that this Lamb has become in them the indwelling ark with many marvelous aspects. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2pgjkmdlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> I can testify that I enjoy Christ in a very rich way as the ark. To me, Christ as God’s testimony is a precious container with God’s portrait concealed inside. He also has a covering with a crown. This crown is the top part of my Christ. On this top part the redeeming blood has been sprinkled. No matter how many failures and defeats I have and no matter how many mistakes I make, I can still enjoy Christ because I am standing on the blood. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1030" id="1030">[1030]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3r1iJ92EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> If we are short of the proper knowledge, we may speak of being under the blood. Actually, the Bible does not say that the believers are under the blood. We have the blood as our ground and standing. Likewise, according to the type of the ark of testimony with the propitiatory cover, God is not under the blood, but is standing on the blood. If we have Christ as the ark, we also have the redeeming blood. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9nDOvN1w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> No words can describe the glory we experience when we meet with God upon Christ as the propitiatory cover. Although we may not have the understanding or the words, we have a deep sense of peace and the realization we are experiencing something glorious. Often as we meet with the Lord, we are repentant and say to Him, “O Lord, forgive me. I am so evil. I have been a Christian for many years, but I am still sinful.” But even as we are repenting and begging the Lord for forgiveness, we have the sense within of something glorious. On the one hand, we confess that we are evil, pitiful, and full of failures and defeats. On the other hand, deep within we have peace and joy. Outwardly we may weep, but inwardly we sense a deep rejoicing. This inner sense comes from the blood and the glory in the midst of which God meets with us. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC45U4-H5C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> When we spend time with the Lord in the Holy of Holies, we are infused by Him with all He is. We may illustrate this by the case of a young man who spends an hour in conversation with a famous university professor. After this hour spent in the presence of such a professor, many things from that person will be infused into the young man. He may even unconsciously imitate the professor’s way of speaking. How much more will the Lord infuse Himself into us if we spend an hour of fellowship with Him! </p>

Speaking of Christ Jesus, Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35705" data-verses="Romans 3:25">Romans 3:25</span>, “Whom God set forth a propitiation-cover through faith in His blood.” Here the Greek word for propitiation-cover is <em>hilasterion,</em> which means the place of propitiation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35706" data-verses="Hebrews 9:5">Hebrews 9:5</span> this word is used for the cover, the lid of the ark within the Holy of Holies. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35707" data-verses="Exodus 25:17-22">Exodus 25:17-22</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35708" data-verses="Leviticus 16:12-16">Leviticus 16:12-16</span>, the Septuagint also uses this word for the cover of the ark. The King James Version adopts the rendering “mercy seat.” This indicates that those translators regarded the place of propitiation as a seat, realizing that Christ as the place of propitiation was a seat for God to grant mercy to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36YDlLCfhsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> It is important to see that propitiation is not only an act; it is also Christ Himself as a place. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35709" data-verses="Romans 3:25">Romans 3:25</span>, God set up Christ Himself, the Person, to be a propitiation-cover. It is upon this Person that God can meet with us and we can meet with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0BxR21ZoJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> In the book of Hebrews Paul speaks of the propitiation-cover as the throne of grace: “Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35710" data-verses="Hebrews 4:16">4:16</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35711" data-verses="Hebrews 10:19-20">Hebrews 10:19 and 20</span> say, “Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1040" id="1040">[1040]</span> that is, His flesh.” The throne of grace is in the Holy of Holies, for it is the cover of the ark, which is in the Holy of Holies. Thus, the cover of the ark is a place where God gives us grace. For this reason, the place where God gives grace to us is surely the throne of grace. Now we must see that this throne of grace, the place where God gives us grace, is actually Christ Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9IuqplJQHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> In these messages on the ark of the testimony we have seen that the entire ark with its cover is a type of Christ. This is a matter of great significance. Christ is all-inclusive. We should not think that the propitiation-cover on the ark is something other than Christ Himself and regard propitiation simply as an act accomplished by Christ. To repeat, Christ is the entire ark, including the top, the cover. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGl-pBwZfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> Because few Christians have seen that Christ is the place of propitiation, the propitiation-cover, they do not appreciate the preciousness of the blood on this cover. Rather, the majority of Christians appreciate the preciousness of the blood at the cross. Instead of entering into the Holy of Holies, they continue to linger at the cross, the altar. Most of the hymns written about the redeeming blood are centered on the cross. Can you find one hymn which speaks about the preciousness of the redeeming blood on the propitiatory cover? I do not know of such a hymn. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPZ_HkqvJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ">THE ARK IN THE MENDING MINISTRY OF JOHN</h2><p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnCxiuRr9fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> We have seen that both Paul and John spoke of matters related to Christ as the propitiatory cover. Both Paul’s completing ministry and John’s mending ministry cover this point. Certain points in the mending ministry of John are stronger than the points in the completing ministry of Paul. When something is mended, often it is stronger than it was before. For example, when you mend a worn part of a garment, the area that is mended is usually stronger than the original cloth. This is true of the mending ministry of John with respect to Christ as the ark. </p>

Speaking of Christ, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35733" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span> says, “Who being the effulgence of His glory and the express image of His substance.” Christ as the effulgence of God’s glory is the cherubim.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35734" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1">Hebrews 2</span> we have the element of acacia wood, the human nature of Christ.

<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4Tpq-OwKTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> In this message we come to the second item of the furniture of the tabernacle—the table of the bread of the Presence. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj9N53HOVIFazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> The sequence in which the furniture of the tabernacle is unveiled is very meaningful. The first item to be revealed is not the tabernacle itself, but the ark of the testimony. Without the ark there is no way to have the tabernacle. This indicates that if we do not have Christ as the embodiment of God, we cannot have the enlargement of Christ, which is the church, His Body. Thus, it is significant that in the record in Exodus God speaks about the ark of the testimony before He reveals the details regarding the tabernacle. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_bcxF21ANcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> In the outer court there were the brass altar and the laver; in the Holy Place, the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar; and in the Holy of Holies, the ark of the testimony. Although God’s revelation begins with the ark, this is not where we begin in our experience. Rather, in experience we start with the altar in the outer court. After experiencing the altar with the laver, we then may enter the tabernacle and come to the table, the lampstand, and the golden altar in the Holy Place. Only then are we able to enter into the Holy of Holies and stand before the ark to meet with God based upon the redeeming blood sprinkled on the propitiatory cover. Then we can talk with God, have fellowship with Him, and receive His instructions. Therefore, the sequence of the furniture in <span class="pg" data-page-id="1048" id="1048">[1048]</span> experience—from the brass altar to the ark—is different from the sequence according to revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vVmTtrpXqd_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> According to God’s revelation, the first aspect of the tabernacle revealed to Moses was the ark of the testimony, a type of Christ as the embodiment of God. Because Christ is the embodiment of God, He is God’s testimony. Not only does Christ speak for God—He speaks God. He is God Himself expressed. Christ as the embodiment of God is typified by the testimony within the ark, and Christ as the expression of God is typified by the golden rim, or crown, upon the ark. First, God is embodied in Christ, and then He is expressed from within Him. This is not the hidden God, God in a mystery, but the expressed God, God in revelation. Christ Himself is God in revelation; He is the very God revealed. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9mBOvN3w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> In Christ God is embodied and expressed. When this Christ is enlarged, we have the church. The church as the Body of Christ to be His enlargement is typified by the tabernacle as the enlargement of the ark. </p>

A TABLE SIGNIFYING CHRIST AS THE FOOD<br/>FOR GOD’S PRIESTS</h2><p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTbABwBDXVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> According to the sequence of God’s revelation, after the ark of the testimony we have the table of the bread of the Presence. This implies that the table is connected to the ark. The ark is for God’s testimony, and the table is for our nourishment. Not only is it necessary for God to have a testimony, but it is also necessary for us to receive nourishment. Without nourishment we would be hungry and eventually die. Praise the Lord that we have the ark for God’s testimony and the table for our nourishment! </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8NLu1K3xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> We need to consider the relationship between the ark and the table from the standpoint of our experience. We know from experience that when we meet with God upon Christ as the propitiatory cover, enjoying fellowship with God and hearing words from His mouth, the ark becomes a table where we enjoy a nourishing feast. Has there ever been a time when you have met with God in the Holy of Holies on Christ as the propitiatory cover, conversed with Him, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="1049" id="1049">[1049]</span> received a word from Him, and yet there was no table set up for your nourishment? Experientially speaking, it is not even necessary to say that a table has been set up, for the ark spontaneously becomes the table. This means that Christ, God’s testimony, becomes our nourishment. As the embodiment of God, Christ becomes a table full of life supply to nourish us. This is not a mere doctrine. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m5PK4CMpyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> Those who lack experience will have no way to understand what we are talking about. Because they are strangers to the culture related to spiritual things, they cannot understand this language about the ark of testimony becoming in our experience the table of the bread of the Presence. Nevertheless, it is a fact of spiritual experience that when we have the propitiatory cover of the ark, Christ as our place of propitiation, eventually the ark becomes a table. All of this is the experience of the one Christ, the very Christ who is the embodiment and expression of God as His testimony who becomes both the table and also the food upon which we may feast for our nourishment. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh12PqmPovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> In particular, the table of the bread of the Presence signifies Christ as the feast for God’s priests. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35745" data-verses="Exodus 25:23-29">Exodus 25:23-29</span> does not say anything about priests. However, the priests were the only ones qualified to be in the Holy Place. Those who were not priests were forbidden to enter the tabernacle. It is significant that this table was not set up in the outer court, but set up in the tabernacle. All those who ate of the bread displayed on this table were priests. For this reason, the table signifies that Christ is a feast for God’s priests. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-2D9kYe089qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> Every believer in Christ is a priest. This is a spiritual fact. But because of the degraded situation today, many Christians do not live as priests. The reason they are not living as priests is that they are not in the tabernacle. Many are lingering in the outer court, and others are still in the world. What percentage of today’s Christians would you say are living as priests in the Holy Place? We must admit that the percentage is extremely small. </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB5CJSfIj6RI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> As we consider the picture of the tabernacle and the outer court, we can see the real situation among Christians <span class="pg" data-page-id="1050" id="1050">[1050]</span> today. When we speak concerning the table in the Holy Place, we are not speaking of Christians in the outer court or those who have not yet come into the outer court. Rather, we are speaking of those who have entered the tabernacle and who are there serving God as His priests. Christ as the feasting table is for this category of Christians. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZcyj8-GcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> The experience of feasting on the bread of the Presence is different from the experience of eating manna. The bread of the Presence was in the Holy Place, whereas the manna was gathered outside the court of the tabernacle. When some Christians hear that the table signifies Christ as the feast for God’s priests, they may argue that they daily enjoy the Lord as their manna. It is true that many believers do enjoy manna. This enjoyment, however, is in the wilderness, not even in the outer court. In this message we are not speaking of manna—we are speaking of the table of the bread of the Presence. It is very important that we see this distinction. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-QOwcLyIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> Another difference between the bread of the Presence on the table in the Holy Place and the manna in the wilderness is that manna typifies Christ as the daily life supply, but the table signifies Christ as our weekly supply. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35746" data-verses="Leviticus 24:5-9">Leviticus 24:5-9</span>, fresh loaves were placed on the table once a week. Hence, the table signifies a weekly supply. The daily supply of the manna enables us to live; the weekly supply from the table enables us not only to live, but also to serve the Lord. It supplies us that we may have a serving life. With manna we have the life supply for our living; with the table we have the supply of life for our serving. Thus, we have both a daily supply for living and a weekly supply for serving. Those Christians who are feeding only on manna need to realize that this is different from enjoying Christ as the weekly supply to serve God as priests in His tabernacle. Christ is not only the manna for God’s people in a general way; He is also in particular a table for God’s priests. </p>

Acacia wood here signifies that Christ’s humanity is the basic element for Him to be our feast. It is significant that both the ark of the testimony and the table were made of acacia wood, signifying Christ’s humanity. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh12fqucYvIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3">E.

Within Him, Christ’s humanity is the basic element for our enjoyment, and upon Him is His divinity as the expression of God. If we enjoy Christ, we shall express God. This means that as we enjoy the Lord Jesus as the supply with which to serve God, the outcome will be gold, Christ’s divinity as the expression of God. This is very meaningful, and I trust in the Spirit to reveal more to the saints concerning it. From our spiritual experience we know that the more we enjoy Christ as the basic element of our feast, the more we express God. This is the significance of the table being overlaid with gold. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1056" id="1056">[1056]</span> </p>

We have previously seen this with respect to the rim of gold around the ark of the testimony. With both the ark and the table, the significance of the rim of gold is the same. </p>

<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5QT5lOcEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35753" data-verses="Exodus 25:23">verse 23</span>, the table was two cubits in length and a cubit in width. Here we have two units of measure, each one cubit square, or two square cubits. In the Bible the number one signifies a complete unit, a unique unit. Furthermore, for something to be square indicates that it is perfect and without bias or defect. Thus, the two square cubits signify the perfect and complete life supply of Christ to issue in a testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FbdH3mSwPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> The enjoyment of Christ is perfect, represented by a square. It is without bias or defect.

This signifies that the standard here is up to that of the ark of the testimony. The nourishment of Christ to us as serving priests matches the standard of God’s testimony. If our enjoyment of Christ does not come up to God’s testimony as signified by the height of the ark, then our enjoyment is not perfect. It is in some way defective and below the standard. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPDzrDasbW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> Today Christians everywhere read the Bible and study it. But is the standard of their enjoyment up to the standard of <span class="pg" data-page-id="1057" id="1057">[1057]</span> God’s testimony? In the vast majority of cases it is not up to God’s standard. Along with the study of the Bible, some Christian groups use worldly music. The use of such music lowers the standard to a very great degree. On the one hand, these Christians have the Bible; on the other hand, they have things which lower the standard. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzINDMzQ_D9BVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> As we consider the picture of the ark of the testimony and of the table of the bread of the Presence, we see that the height of both the ark and the table is the same—one and a half cubits. This indicates that the ark and the table are on the same level. This reveals that our enjoyment of Christ must match the standard of God’s testimony. Our enjoyment of Christ through the Word must be very high. No place should be given to any gimmicks which lower the standard. </p>

A Frame Round About</h2><p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36ZBlLINhsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35755" data-verses="Exodus 25:25">Exodus 25:25</span> says, “And you shall make for it a border of a handbreadth round about; and you shall make a rim of gold to its border round about.” According to our present understanding, the Hebrew word here does denote a border. However, it does not denote a border in an ordinary sense. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35756" data-verses="Exodus 25:26-27">verses 26 and 27</span>, four rings of gold were to be put upon the four corners which were on its four feet. Furthermore, the rings were to be “close to the border as receptacles for the poles to carry the table.” In Hebrew, the word rendered close means side by side. Thus, for the rings to be close to the border means that they were next to the border. This indicates that, since the rings were on the four corners which were on the four feet of the table, the border must have been close to the bottom of the table. Some translations use the word frame instead of border. </p>

For Connecting and Strengthening the Legs</h2><p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneHDNN7IUnXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> As we consider the table and its frame, or its border, we see that the purpose of the frame was to connect the legs and strengthen them. In this way the frame helped to stabilize the table. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1058" id="1058">[1058]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2bQBwwAIUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN">2. Of a Handbreadth</h2><p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zOuBaszyXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> The frame, or border, was a handbreadth round about. A handbreadth here signifies full of strength to connect and strengthen. Notice that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35757" data-verses="Exodus 25:25">verse 25</span> does not say that the frame was a handbreadth in height. This may indicate that the frame was a square handbreadth, a handbreadth in both width and height. Such a frame certainly would have been a strong support to the table. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgUDYvRJPwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema">3. With a Rim of Gold</h2><p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjI6AqiyzM7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35758" data-verses="Exodus 25:25">Verse 25</span> says that a rim of gold was made to its border round about. Just as there was a rim, or crown, upon the top of the table (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35759" data-verses="Exodus 25:24">v. 24</span>), so there was a rim of gold upon the frame. As we have pointed out, this rim is for keeping and holding. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wN6sm3J8Pl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> It is not adequate simply to use our mind to try to understand the significance of the frame round about the legs of the table. We need to consider this in the light of Christian experience. We know from our experience with the Lord that when we obtain Christ as our nourishment, Christ becomes to us a table with power to connect and strengthen. This means that the enjoyment of Christ as a feast strengthens us, connects us, upholds us, and keeps us. Every aspect of the frame is related to our experience. The size, shape, and material are all significant when considered in the light of spiritual experience. </p>

These rings do not signify the divinity of Christ. Rather, they signify the Spirit of Christ as the linking factor and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1059" id="1059">[1059]</span> linking power. In typology, a gold ring signifies the Spirit. When Rebekah became engaged to Isaac, she received rings of gold. These rings signify the Spirit mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35761" data-verses="Ephesians 1:13">Ephesians 1:13</span>. Furthermore, when the prodigal son came home, the father gave him not only a robe signifying Christ as righteousness to cover him, but also a ring of gold, which signifies the initial gift, the sealing Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35762" data-verses="Luke 15:22">Luke 15:22</span>). The Spirit signified by a golden ring is a uniting bond. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35763" data-verses="Ephesians 4:3">Ephesians 4:3</span> speaks of keeping the oneness of the Spirit. This oneness of the Spirit is the ring, the bond with its binding power. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4flYo05VCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> If Christ were only the Lord objectively in heaven and not also the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us subjectively, there would be no way for us as believers to be united, for we would not have the golden rings. In order to have oneness and to keep the oneness, we must have in our experience the rings of gold, the Spirit as the linking factor and the linking power. </p>

<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd86266zCM5Y6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> In this message we come to the lampstand. The golden lampstand may be regarded as the most mysterious of all the furnishings in the tabernacle. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIPPqIXxO3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC">I. THE EXPRESSION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbADPNgBpHhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> The lampstand signifies the expression of the Triune God. This alone is sufficient to impress us with how mysterious the lampstand is. Nothing in the universe is more mysterious than the Triune God. Furthermore, the most puzzling element of the divine revelation in the Bible is also the Triune God. Throughout the centuries, readers of the Bible have been puzzled by the revelation of the Triune God in the Scriptures. Even today we do not have an adequate understanding of the Triune God. However, it is very helpful to see that the lampstand is the expression of the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0SZy8Jmx8Wf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> Throughout the centuries of their history, the Jewish people have treasured the lampstand. But no rabbi would ever say that the lampstand signifies the expression of the Triune God. I do not even know of any Christians who have such a realization. Actually, this understanding of the lampstand is a truth recently recovered by the Lord in His recovery. Years ago, we said nothing about the lampstand signifying the expression of the Triune God. But several years ago we began to see that in the Bible the lampstand is an expression of the Triune God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1068" id="1068">[1068]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZcyD8-EcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> As we consider this matter of the golden lampstand, we need to remember that the Bible is a complete entity. Hence, we should not separate <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35773" data-verses="Exodus 25:31-40">25:31-40</span> from the rest of the Word and ignore all the other books of the Bible. The lampstand is mentioned not only in Exodus, but also in 1 Kings, Zechariah, and Revelation. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35774" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">chapter one</span> of Revelation, the lampstand is the church. Furthermore, the seven lamps are the Spirit. How mysterious this is! Eventually, at the consummation of the divine revelation, the lampstand in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35775" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span> becomes the church, and the seven lamps become the Spirit of God. By this we see that a great deal is involved with the lampstand, for the lampstand is related both to the church and to the Spirit of God. The book of Revelation also emphasizes the church and the Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35776" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">Revelation 22:17</span> even contains the words, “The Spirit and the bride say....” Here we see that the Spirit and the church have become one in speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-QOQcLwIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> In the last century certain teachers emphasized the significance of the types in the Old Testament. Concerning the lampstand, these teachers mainly said that the lampstand is a type of Christ as the light of the world. What they said was right and good; however, it was not adequate. These teachers of the Word did not see that the lampstand is an expression of the Triune God, that consummately the lampstand becomes the church, and that the seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven Spirits of God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cB1gO1TYwWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa">A. The Substance</h2><p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTr5OAE5AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> As we ponder the substance, the stand, and the lamps of the lampstand, we see that the lampstand is indeed the expression of the Triune God. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35777" data-verses="Exodus 25:31">25:31</span>, the lampstand was of pure gold. Thus, gold is the substance, the element, of the lampstand in its entirety. In typology gold signifies the divine nature, the nature of God the Father. If we consider this substance, this element, of the lampstand, we shall see that it signifies the divine nature. Therefore, by this we can see God the Father, the One whose nature is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1069" id="1069">[1069]</span> very substance of the lampstand. The golden lampstand exists in the nature of God the Father. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd86266zFfZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ">B. The Stand</h2><p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuIPPqIRi-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> God the Father is invisible and abstract. God the Son is the embodiment of this invisible One. The stand is a form signifying God the Son as the embodiment of God the Father. This solid form of the lampstand is the embodiment of the gold. According to the New Testament, God the Father is embodied in God the Son. Here in the lampstand we have the substance signifying the Father, and the solid form signifying the Son. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbADPNgI6HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42">C.

The shining of the lamps denotes expression. Thus, the seven lamps are the expression of God the Son as the embodiment of God the Father. In the book of Revelation we see that the seven lamps are the Spirit of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYEAjIJCazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> Because we have in the lampstand the element of gold signifying God the Father, the stand signifying God the Son, and the seven lamps signifying God the Spirit, we have the ground to say that the lampstand itself is the expression of the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l2CUgAMMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> We have pointed out that, consummately, in the book of Revelation the lampstand becomes the church. If we realize this, our understanding of the church will be deepened and enriched. The church is actually the expression of God. In this expression we see the Father’s nature, the Son’s embodiment, and the Spirit’s expression. In the proper church life, God the Father is the substance, God the Son is the embodiment, and God the Spirit is the expression. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35781" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span> the lampstand signifies Christ, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35782" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1</span> it signifies the churches. This indicates that the unique Christ has been reproduced, that the one lampstand has become seven lampstands. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35783" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span> we have the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1070" id="1070">[1070]</span> masterpiece, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35784" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1</span> we have the masterpiece reproduced and multiplied. Praise the Lord for the one lampstand in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35785" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span> and the seven lampstands in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35786" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1</span>! At first God’s expression was only in Christ as the lampstand. Now this expression has been reproduced in the churches as golden lampstands. By this we see that Christ has been reproduced. The church is actually the reproduction of Christ. Both Christ and the church are the expression of the Triune God. In the church life we have the nature of the Father, the embodiment of the Son, and the expression of the Spirit. How wonderful! </p>

<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GtYV6ct5KauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> In their experience, most Christians have not yet entered the Holy Place. On the contrary, they spend a great deal of time at the altar, the cross, in the outer court. In a very real sense, we need to leave the cross and enter into the Holy Place. Where are you in your experience—at the altar or in the Holy Place? Many among us may still be at the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQa9Q9swwgajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> We have seen that the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God, signifies the saints who have been built up to be the house of God. We all need to ask ourselves if we are truly in the dwelling place of God. This means that we must inquire whether or not we have been built into the church as God’s house. Among a great many Christians today, there is no experience of the lampstand, because these believers are still at the cross and have not been built up with others. Since there is no dwelling place of God, no building with the saints, how can there be the lampstand? It is impossible. The lampstand is not near the cross in the outer court; it is within the dwelling place of God, that is, among the saints who have been built up together to be the house of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755X4-zLg9djlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> In the eyes of God, every local church is a lampstand. God regards every church as a house built up for His dwelling.

This table signifies Christ as the life supply; it is a figure showing us that Christ is the source of our life supply. The lampstand signifies Christ as the light of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35787" data-verses="John 8:12">John 8:12</span>).

<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqHyhh-ihEXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> The Gospel of John speaks of Christ as the light of life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35788" data-verses="John 1:4">John 1:4</span> says, “In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35789" data-verses="John 8:12">John 8:12</span>, the Lord Jesus said, “I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” </p>

And there shall be six branches going out from its sides, three branches of the lampstand from its one side, and three branches of the lampstand from its other side.” The lampstand consists of a base, a stalk, and three pairs of branches. There were three branches on each side of the lampstand. Underneath each pair of branches there was a knob holding the two branches at the stalk. Then on each branch there were three cups shaped like almond blossoms with knobs and blossoming buds. We have seen that each cup was composed of two layers: a bottom layer, called the knob, or the calyx, the leafy green bottom of the blossom, and a top layer of petals, which actually made up the blossom, the flower. The bottom layer is called the knob, and the top layer is called the blossoming bud. The whole flower, including calyx and blossom, is a cup shaped like an almond blossom. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGmDTw8TOPzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> As we consider the lampstand as a whole, we shall see that on it there are twenty-five knobs. There are three on each branch, three holding one pair of branches each, and four on the shaft of the lampstand, making a total of twenty-five. Since the three knobs which each hold one pair of branches do not have blossoms, the lampstand has a total of <span class="pg" data-page-id="1082" id="1082">[1082]</span> twenty-two blossoms. The divine thought here is that the lampstand is actually a tree with calyxes and blossoms. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJvvPKPZPAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> If we have a general view of the entire lampstand, we shall realize that it does in fact look like a tree. Furthermore, the lampstand is described in such a way as to give the idea of growth. These verses speak of branches, buds, and almond blossoms. Blossoming indicates growth. Thus, we must be impressed that the lampstand is a growing tree. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqHyhx-pyUXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> As a tree, the lampstand has certain outstanding features. First, it is a golden tree. Gold signifies the nature <span class="pg" data-page-id="1083" id="1083">[1083]</span> of God. As we pointed out in the previous message, the golden lampstand is the expression of the Triune God. The Triune God is a living tree, growing, budding, and blossoming. </p>

<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPDzrjasZW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> We have seen that this golden tree has many almond blossoms. In typology almonds signify resurrection life. Aaron’s rod budding with almonds signifies resurrection life. Hence, the almonds on the lampstand indicate that it is a tree in resurrection. Resurrection is life that overcomes death without being damaged or injured by death. Death is powerless to do anything with resurrection life. Death can inflict all kinds of damage on other forms of life, plant life, animal life, and human life. Only one kind of life cannot be hurt by death, and this is resurrection life. Resurrection is life which passes through death and can never be held by it. According to the full revelation of the Scriptures, God Himself is this resurrection life. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzINDMTQ8DdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> The lampstand, of course, gives light. However, the first significance of the lampstand is not light, but life. The light is at the top of the lampstand and underneath this shining light are the blossoms. The lampstand is something that grows. The calyx under each pair of branches indicates the growth of life. These branches are produced by the growing of life. Thus, with the lampstand we see the branching out of life which takes place under the shining of the light. Life grows out light and blossoms with light. This means that the light is actually the blossoming of life. When we grow and blossom, the light shines. Our blossoming is our shining. We grow with life, but we blossom out light. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAqQ_R6EcD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> Thus far, we have seen that with the lampstand we have the divine nature, resurrection, life, and light. The seven lamps on the lampstand (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35815" data-verses="Exodus 25:37">v. 37</span>) signify the Spirit. Therefore, with the lampstand there are five crucial matters: the divine nature, resurrection, life, the Spirit, and light. The revelation in the Bible, especially in the New Testament, corresponds to the lampstand in these five matters—the divine nature, resurrection, life, the Spirit, and light. </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw36ZBFLLMBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> Now we must see that as those who believe in Christ, we <span class="pg" data-page-id="1084" id="1084">[1084]</span> are a part of this wonderful tree. Realizing that I am part of this golden tree causes me to be beside myself with joy. Praise the Lord that we are parts of this tree in resurrection and with the divine nature, life, the Spirit, and the shining light! </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZ0Azx29KYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> The lampstand in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35816" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span> signifies the Triune God embodied in Christ. The lampstand in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35817" data-verses="Zechariah 4:1">Zechariah 4</span> signifies the Triune God expressed in the Spirit. Finally, in Revelation we have the lampstand reproduced and multiplied. In both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35818" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35819" data-verses="Zechariah 4:1">Zechariah 4</span> we have just one lampstand, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35820" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1</span> we have seven. The one lampstand has been reproduced to become seven lampstands. These seven lampstands are the church. Because the lampstand has become the church and because we are all parts of the church, we have the ground to say that we are parts of the lampstand. I have the boldness to testify that I am a part of the lampstand. I hope that all the saints can declare this marvelous fact. Do you not have the divine nature? Do you not also have resurrection, life, the Spirit, and the shining light? As true believers in Christ, we have all these things. </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneHDNt7LUHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> We have seen that the lampstand is a tree. It is not an entity without light, and neither is it inanimate. It is living, organic, and full of life. It is a tree-stand, a stand that grows like a tree. This living tree is growing, branching, budding, and blossoming. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbou2bQhwzAoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> As we have pointed out, the blossoming is the shining of the light. Thus, the light is the life blossoming. Actually the light is the life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35821" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35822" data-verses="John 1:4">4</span> say, “In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God....In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.” This is the shining of Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, as the light of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zOuhavwSXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> The fact that the lampstand is golden signifies that, as the embodiment of God, Christ is altogether divine. But two aspects of the lampstand point to the humanity of Christ. First, the central stalk of the lampstand has four blossoms, whereas each branch has just three blossoms. In the Bible the number four is not composed of two plus two; rather, it is <span class="pg" data-page-id="1085" id="1085">[1085]</span> composed of three plus one or one plus three. The number three signifies both the Triune God and resurrection. Actually, as we have mentioned, the Triune God is resurrection. Therefore, according to the Bible, the number three signifies the Triune God in resurrection. The number four in the Bible signifies creatures. For example, we have the four living creatures and the four winds. Thus, the number four signifies creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgUD4vSKvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> As God, Christ is the Creator. But as a man, He is a creature. Some Christians may protest when they are told that Christ is both the Creator and a creature. But the Bible definitely says that Christ put on human nature, that He had a body with flesh, blood, and bones. Are these not the elements of a creature? Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35823" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Colossians 1:15</span> says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation. In the lampstand we have not only the Triune God, but also the creature, as signified by the number four. This is the first aspect of the lampstand which points to Christ’s humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjI6AKiyxM7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> The second aspect of the lampstand related to the humanity of Christ is the wick. The wick was made of fibers, primarily of cotton. When the lamps on the stand were lighted, the wick burned with the oil. Every morning it was necessary for the priests to trim the lamps, that is, to snuff the charred, burnt wick. The charred portion of the wick is called snuff. The word snuff is also a verb meaning to cut off the burnt part of the wick. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35824" data-verses="Exodus 25:38">Exodus 25:38</span> speaks of the snuffers and the snuff dishes. The snuffers were used to cut the wick, and the snuff dishes were used to contain the burnt part of the wick. When the priest trimmed the lamps every morning, he cut off the charred wick and also added fresh oil. This was the priests’ work in caring for the lampstand. </p>

<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-Dwlw8M3paQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> As we consider the various types related to the tabernacle, we shall pay more attention to the aspect of experience than to the aspect of doctrine. In the past many books have been written on the furniture of the tabernacle. For the most part, these books concentrate on doctrine. Reading these expositions of the tabernacle does not afford much help on the experiential side. Throughout the years I have learned that these types are not only for doctrine, but also for our experience. Furthermore, this experience should not be general Christian experience. Rather, it must be the experience of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNFR-oHKJKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> The title of this message is “The Lampstand—Growing, Branching, Budding, and Blossoming to Shine the Light.” Here we have six matters: growing, branching, budding, blossoming, shining, and light. In order to have the shining of the light, we must first have the growing, the branching, the budding, and the blossoming. Only when we reach the last step, the step of blossoming, can there be the shining, for we shine by blossoming. We blossom in order to shine. Then the light, of course, comes out from the shining. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf4h_LoiD2ndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> The lampstand portrays Christ. However, the Christ pictured by the lampstand is not simple; He is the all-inclusive Christ. We may even say that, in a positive sense, He is a <span class="pg" data-page-id="1096" id="1096">[1096]</span> complicated Christ. This Christ is portrayed by a lampstand with one stalk, six branches, and seven lamps. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLYEBDIJAazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that the lampstand is actually a tree; hence, it is a tree-stand. On this golden tree we have the calyxes (the knobs), the buds, and the blossoms. Only something organic and living is able to bud and blossom. Thus, as we consider the lampstand with its branches, calyxes, buds, and blossoms, we have the definite impression that this golden lampstand is a tree. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l2D0gAOMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35855" data-verses="Exodus 25:35">Verse 35</span> is written in a very unusual way: “And a knob under two branches of it, and a knob under two branches of it, and a knob under two branches of it, for the six branches going out from the lampstand.” The repetition in this verse related to the knobs and the branches indicates growth. Hence, the central stalk of the lampstand is something living and growing. As the stalk grows, the branches grow also. First, two branches grow out of the lower part of the stalk. Then as the stalk continues to grow, two more pairs of branches grow out, one pair out of the middle section and another pair out of the upper section of the stalk. Furthermore, knobs, buds, and blossoms appear on all the branches. With the full growth we eventually have the budding and the blossoming to produce flowers. The buds produce petals, and the petals are parts of the blossom. First we have the growing, then the budding, and finally the blossoming. This blossoming produces the shining of the light. For this reason, in this message we speak of growing, branching, budding, and blossoming to shine the light. The branching is implied in the growing. The shining of the light is the issue of the four steps of growing, branching, budding, and blossoming. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBpuT7yNFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> On the lampstand there is a total of twenty-five knobs, or calyxes. There are three knobs under the pairs of branches, one knob under each pair; three on each of the six branches; and four on the upper part of the stalk, making a total of twenty-five. The number twenty-five is composed of five times five. In the Bible five is the number of responsibility. This can be illustrated by our hand with its four fingers and <span class="pg" data-page-id="1097" id="1097">[1097]</span> thumb. The number five in the Bible is composed not of two plus three, but of four plus one. The number four signifies the creature, the creation, and the number one signifies God the Creator. Furthermore, the fact that five is the number of responsibility is indicated by the dividing of the ten virgins into two groups of five, five wise and five foolish, and the engraving of the Ten Commandments in two groups of five on two tablets of stone. The twenty-five knobs indicate five times the number of responsibility. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Bttzj9qck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> Although there are twenty-five knobs, there are only twenty-two buds, for the three knobs holding the three pairs of branches do not have any buds. That there are twenty-five knobs for responsibility and only twenty-two buds for blossoming and shining indicates that with the lampstand the matter of responsibility for growth is greater than the matter of budding, blossoming, and shining. This means that growth is basic. It shows that we need more growth, even growth multiplied twenty-five times. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_GtZ16fsZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M">I. CHRIST AS THE RESURRECTION LIFE<br/>GROWING, BRANCHING, BUDDING, AND BLOSSOMING<br/>TO SHINE THE LIGHT</h2><p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQa9RdszxAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> As a type of Christ, the lampstand portrays Christ as the resurrection life growing, branching, budding, and blossoming to shine the light. We have seen that the lampstand is a growing entity. Since the lampstand typifies Christ, it indicates that Christ is the One who is growing. Remember that the lampstand is not made up of only one branch and one lamp. On the contrary, as the central stalk grows, it produces three pairs of branches. Moreover, all the branches are growing and have knobs, buds, and blossoms. As the stalk of the lampstand begins to grow, it produces the first pair of branches. Then as it continues to grow, it produces the second pair and finally the third. Eventually, the stalk itself grows to its full measure. All this indicates that Christ is growing. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755X4_TLj99jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> Christ grows first in Himself and then also in us as the branches. Apparently it is the branches that are growing. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1098" id="1098">[1098]</span> Actually, it is the stand that is growing through the branches and within them. This indicates Christ’s growth in us. We are not growing—Christ is growing in us. As the central stalk, Christ grows in Himself, by Himself, and with Himself. But in the six branches He grows in us, by us, and with us. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoAGmCjw6AePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> This matter of Christ growing both in Himself and in us is not merely a doctrine; it is a vision which applies to us in our experience with the Lord. We have pointed out that there are six branches on the lampstand. Man was made on the sixth day; hence, six is the number of man. This number is composed not of two plus four, but of three plus three. The number three in the Bible indicates the Triune God in resurrection. Although as those created on the sixth day we are the number six, we nonetheless have the Triune God in resurrection. This means that we are created men who are now in the Triune God in resurrection. This is the significance of the number six composed of three plus three. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJvu_KGJvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> As the stalk, Christ is growing in Himself and with Himself; but He is also growing in us as the six branches. This is why we say that the lampstand does not portray a simple Christ, but rather a complicated Christ, the all-inclusive Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqHygB-hikXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> The lampstand also implies two other matters—the wick and the oil. If the lampstand did not have a wick and if it was not supplied with oil, it would be impossible for it to burn and give light. The wick was made of material from plants and thus signifies humanity. The oil, a symbol of the Spirit, signifies divinity. When humanity is burned in divinity, there is the shining of light. However, if our wick becomes too long, smoke will be produced instead of light. Whenever there is too much wick and too little oil, there is smoking instead of shining. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2OyM4bAL6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> There is no mention in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35856" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span> of either the wick or the oil. But if we consider the picture of the lampstand given in this chapter, we shall realize that both the wick and the oil are implied. How could the lampstand shine if it did not have a wick and a supply of oil? Thus, the wick and the oil <span class="pg" data-page-id="1099" id="1099">[1099]</span> are implied. Furthermore, the wick must be of the right length, in proper proportion to the lampstand, and there must be an adequate quantity of oil. Then the wick and the oil will work together to produce the burning, the burning will cause the shining, and the shining will give forth light. However, this burning and shining result from the growing, branching, budding, and blossoming. </p>

The first layer, the innermost layer, was made of ten curtains of fine twined linen. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQjqbMNedGh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> Most translations use the word tabernacle in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35865" data-verses="Exodus 26:1">26:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35866" data-verses="Exodus 26:6">6</span>. However, some versions use the word tent. Actually, the tabernacle was a tent. A tent is a temporary, movable dwelling place used primarily for camping. According to the record of the Bible, the tabernacle, God’s tent, did not have a floor. Because the tent was portable, it was set up on the ground. For a period of forty years, the children of Israel were camping in the wilderness, and God was camping with them. The tents belonging to God’s people were erected around the tabernacle. In the first chapters of Numbers we see that the twelve tribes were camped in four directions around the tabernacle. Hence, in the wilderness both God and the people dwelt in tents. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPDzqDakLm2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35867" data-verses="Exodus 26:1">26:1</span> that ten curtains were used in making God’s tent, the tabernacle. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35868" data-verses="Exodus 26:2">Verse 2</span> gives the dimensions of the curtains: “The length of each curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits—one measure for all the curtains.” These ten curtains were <span class="pg" data-page-id="1106" id="1106">[1106]</span> arranged in two sets of five curtains each. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35869" data-verses="Exodus 26:3">Verse 3</span> says, “Five curtains shall be joined one to another, and the other five curtains joined to one another.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35870" data-verses="Exodus 26:4">verse 4</span> the “one set” refers to the first five curtains, and the “second set” to the second group of five. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35871" data-verses="Exodus 26:4">Verse 4</span> says, “And you shall make loops of blue upon the edge of the outermost curtain in the one set, and likewise you shall make them at the edge of the outermost curtain in the second set.” The outermost curtain in each set refers to the edge of the last curtain in the set. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35872" data-verses="Exodus 26:5-6">Verses 5 and 6</span> indicate how these two sets of curtains were joined together: “You shall make fifty loops in the one curtain, and you shall make fifty loops at the end of the curtain which is in the second set; the loops shall be opposite to one another. And you shall make fifty clasps of gold, and join the curtains to one another with the clasps, and the tabernacle shall become one.” When the two sets were coupled together, the result was a large sheet which measured forty cubits by twenty-eight cubits. When the tabernacle was erected, this sheet of linen curtains was spread upon the standing boards. Then the linen sheet became a tent. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zOvBavySXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> The tabernacle itself was thirty cubits in length and ten cubits in both width and height. We have seen that the linen sheet measured forty cubits by twenty-eight cubits. This indicates that there was an overhang at the rear and at the sides of the tabernacle. (There was no overhang at the front, for that was the entrance of the tabernacle.) Therefore, there was an overhang of ten cubits at the rear of the tabernacle and of nine cubits on each side. In the Bible the number nine is composed not of four plus five, but of three times three. This points to the Triune God in resurrection. When we visualize the linen sheet spread over the standing boards, we can see a tent with an overlapping on the sides and at the rear. </p>

<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wN6tm3K-vl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e">B. Ten Curtains</h2><p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW4To6-JjqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> The number ten in the Bible signifies human perfection and completion, a completion without defect. Our ten fingers illustrate this human completion and perfection. If we had four fingers on one hand and five on the other, there would be a defect instead of completion. Furthermore, God gave man the Ten Commandments. These commandments were given for man’s completion and perfection. It is significant that God did not give nine commandments or eleven, but gave ten in order to signify human perfection. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj9N4nHIG4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> Furthermore, the number ten is composed of five times two. Five is the number of responsibility, and two is the number of testimony. Thus, five times two signifies two times of responsibility for a testimony. As we have pointed out, the number five is composed of four plus one. The number four signifies the creature, and one signifies God, the unique Creator. Hence, God plus man equals five, the number of responsibility. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_bcwV28TNcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> The ten curtains typify Christ as a man, a man who is perfect and complete. With Him there is no defect or bias. As typified by the ten curtains, Christ is a perfect and complete man. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vVmS9rhE6d_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> We have seen that with the tabernacle there was an overflow of curtains on each side. No doubt, this overflow was balanced; it was the same on both sides. This balanced overflow can be illustrated by the parts of our physical body which are arranged in twos. We have two eyes, ears, shoulders, arms, hands, legs, and feet. In all that we do, seeing, hearing, sitting, standing, and walking, there must be two. For example, if we had only one foot, we could not walk properly. Instead of walking step by step, we would need to hop on one foot. Likewise, if we had only one ear, hearing would be difficult. As a perfect and complete man, Christ has a balanced overflow, an equal overflow on both sides. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4flZo07WCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> We have pointed out that the linen sheet draped over each side a length of nine cubits. We have also seen that the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1108" id="1108">[1108]</span> number nine signifies the Triune God in resurrection. The Lord Jesus is a true man, but His overflow is the Triune God in resurrection. Furthermore, this overflow is not unbalanced or one-sided; on the contrary, it is even and balanced in every way. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP33Zf6DP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> We must remember that the ten linen curtains signify Christ’s humanity and that the overflow signifies the Triune God in resurrection. This reveals that in His humanity Christ expresses the Triune God in resurrection. The four Gospels record that during the course of His life on earth, the Lord Jesus was a perfect and complete man with a balanced overflow. Even His overflow reveals that He is a man, but a man expressing the Triune God in resurrection. As a man, the Lord is the number ten, but His overflow is number nine. This means that He is a man overflowing with the Triune God in resurrection. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2ojzklcFAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS">C. Fine Linen</h2><p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3q2yJ-3kyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> The ten curtains were made of fine linen. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35873" data-verses="Revelation 19:8">Revelation 19:8</span>, fine linen signifies righteous conduct. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35874" data-verses="Exodus 26:1">Exodus 26:1</span> says that the linen was not only fine, but was also twined. Fine signifies evenness, and twined indicates that the linen was not loose in any way. Christ’s conduct was never coarse; rather, it was always fine. However, our conduct is often coarse, rough, or tough. Christ’s conduct was also twined; that is, it was never loose. Our conduct, on the contrary, is often loose; it has not been properly dealt with to make it twined. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9mAevO3Q9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> The more we consider the Person of Christ revealed in the four Gospels, a Person who is fine and perfect in every way, the more we realize that the Gospels were written according to divine inspiration. Nevertheless, some unbelievers have argued that it is not possible for a person such as the One described in the Gospels to have ever lived. A certain French philosopher once said in response to this charge that if the Gospels were not true and trustworthy writings, that is, if they did not describe a person who actually lived, then the writer of the Gospels is qualified to be <span class="pg" data-page-id="1109" id="1109">[1109]</span> this person. The human mind is not capable of composing writings such as the Gospels, for in these writings we see portrayed a man who is fine, perfect, and complete. The human mind could never conceive of such a person. Furthermore, the mind of man does not have the wisdom to compose the Gospels. </p>

<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o8zOvxaogyXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> In the previous message we considered the first layer of the covering of the tabernacle. As we pointed out, that layer is itself called the tabernacle. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35891" data-verses="Exodus 26:1">Exodus 26:1</span> speaks of making the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine linen. In this message we shall consider the second, third, and fourth layers of the covering. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCgUCovUafwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35892" data-verses="Exodus 26:7-8">Verses 7 and 8</span> say, “And you shall make curtains of goats’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle: you shall make eleven curtains. The length of each curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits—one measure for the eleven curtains.” In the last message we pointed out that the tabernacle is a tent. Now we see from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35893" data-verses="Exodus 26:7">verse 7</span> that the second layer of the cover is a tent over the tabernacle. Thus, the second layer is a tent which covers the first layer, which is the tabernacle. The tabernacle was made of ten curtains, each measuring twenty-eight cubits by four cubits. The second layer is made of eleven curtains, each measuring thirty cubits by four cubits. The first layer is called the tabernacle, and the second layer is called the tent. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjI6Bai4js7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> It is significant that there are ten curtains in the first layer and eleven in the second layer. In the Bible ten is the number of human completion and perfection, and twelve is the number of perfection in the divine administration. Furthermore, ten is composed of two times five. For example, the ten virgins in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35894" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">Matthew 25</span> are in two groups of five, and the Ten Commandments were inscribed in groups of five on two tablets of stone. As we have seen, the number <span class="pg" data-page-id="1118" id="1118">[1118]</span> five is composed of four, signifying the creature, plus one, signifying God the Creator. The number eleven falls between ten and twelve. It is more than human completion and less than the perfection of the divine administration. Thus, the number eleven in the Bible indicates something sinful. On the one hand, it points to something in excess of human completion; on the other hand, it indicates something short of the perfection in the divine administration. Therefore, this number indicates sinfulness. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wN6tW3Cs_l3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> The ten curtains which make up the first layer of the tabernacle indicate that the Lord Jesus as a human being was complete and perfect. He is the true number ten, for with Him there is no defect, bias, shortage, or excess. He also has the colors of blue, purple, and scarlet which, respectively, signify heavenliness, royalty, and redemption. Furthermore, the golden cherubim embroidered on the linen curtains signify that in Christ as a creature God’s glory is expressed. Therefore, the ten linen curtains of the first layer reveal that Christ is a perfect, complete, and altogether beautiful human being. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyJvufKGLvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> The second layer of covering typifies a very different aspect of Christ. In this layer we have nothing blue, purple, or scarlet, and there is no embroidery. Instead, there are eleven curtains of goats’ hair. Everything is plain, natural, and without beauty. Furthermore, the number of the curtains is eleven instead of ten, something more than human completion, but below the perfection of God’s government. The eleven curtains of goats’ hair signify that Christ was made sin for us. During the last three hours He was on the cross, from noon until three o’clock in the afternoon, He was judged just as if He were a sinner in the eyes of God. This was the time He cried out and said, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35895" data-verses="Matthew 27:46">Matt. 27:46</span>). In these hours He was forsaken by God because God regarded Him as a sinner, as the One who was made sin for us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35896" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">2 Cor. 5:21</span>). The perfect and complete Lord Jesus thus became a sinner under God’s judgment. He, the righteous One, was judged by God on behalf of the unrighteous. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1119" id="1119">[1119]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqHygh-hgkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> In the Bible fine linen signifies the proper conduct of a pure and perfect human being. However, goats signify those who are evil and condemned by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35897" data-verses="Matthew 25:33">Matt. 25:33</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35898" data-verses="Matthew 25:41">41</span>). Thus, goats signify sinners, and goats’ hair signifies the sins, the evil deeds, of sinners. Thus, the second layer is composed of sinners with all their sins. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDTo2Oys4YAr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> Having considered the number of curtains in the first two layers, let us now turn to their measurements. Each curtain in the first layer was four cubits wide. Ten curtains times four cubits gives us the number forty. In the Bible forty can be a positive number. Perhaps the most impressive use of this number concerns Moses staying with God on the mountain for forty days. We have seen that the number forty signifies tests and trials. The forty days Moses was on the mountain were a test both to him and to the children of Israel. Although Moses was approved by God during this period of time, the children of Israel were exposed. In addition, they were tested during their forty years of wandering in the wilderness. The Lord Jesus also spent forty days in the wilderness. This signifies that He was One who was tried, tested, and eventually approved. According to the four Gospels, the Lord was tested and tried throughout His life. At the very end of His life, He was tried both according to God’s law and to the law of the Roman Empire. Three times He was tried by Jewish authorities according to God’s law, and three times He was tried by officials of the Roman Empire according to the Roman law. Thus, during the last night of His life, He was tried a total of six times, but no wrong could be found in Him. He was fully approved. Thus, He was a perfect number forty. As far as the Lord Jesus is concerned, this number is very positive. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7TuIOYWYe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> When the ten curtains of the first layer are joined, they form a rectangle measuring forty cubits by twenty-eight cubits. Of these forty cubits, twenty covered the Holy Place, ten covered the Holy of Holies, and ten hung down over the rear of the tabernacle, covering the back side. Furthermore, as we pointed out in the foregoing message, there was an overhang on two sides of the tabernacle of nine cubits. Nine, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1120" id="1120">[1120]</span> composed of three times three, signifies the Triune God in resurrection. Christ, the perfect One, has an overflow on each side, and this overflow is the Triune God in resurrection. As we consider the Lord Jesus revealed in the Gospels, we see that He is truly such a person. He is a perfect human being with an overflow of the Triune God in resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9IvpZlJRHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> Each of the curtains in the second layer measured thirty cubits by four cubits. When all the curtains were joined, there was a rectangle measuring forty-four cubits by thirty cubits. This second layer completely covered the first layer and protected it. Fine linen cannot protect anything, but goats’ hair can serve as a protection. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35899" data-verses="Exodus 26:9">verse 9</span>, the sixth curtain was doubled over at the front of the tent. This was for protection and strengthening. The overhang at the rear completely covered the first layer. Furthermore, with the second layer of covering there was an overhang of ten cubits on the two sides. Since the first layer had an overhang of only nine cubits, it was completely covered by the second layer. This means that no part of the linen curtains was exposed to the sun, wind, or rain. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrGk9ZBwYfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> The number thirty in the Bible is composed in two ways, of five times six and three times ten. Five is the number of responsibility, and six is the number of sinners. Thus, thirty composed of five times six signifies responsibility for sinners. When the Lord Jesus was made sin for us, He bore all the responsibility for us as sinners. But when the number thirty is composed of three times ten, it signifies resurrection life in human completion. As the One who became sin for us, the Lord Jesus is full of resurrection life in His human completion. In His human completion, signified by the number ten, we see resurrection, which is actually the Triune God Himself, signified by the number three. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermPY83kquJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> With the Lord Jesus as the One made sin for us, we have the numbers thirty and forty-four. Forty-four was the length of the second layer when all the curtains were joined. This number signifies that Christ was tried as a sinner. </p>

<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2ojTkhOlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> According to the sequence of the divine revelation, the covering of the tabernacle is mentioned before the boards. This is opposite to the human way of speaking about a building, which is to begin with the bottom and proceed upwards toward the roof. The divine way of revealing the tabernacle is to begin with the top, with the four layers of covering. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35922" data-verses="Exodus 36:1">Exodus 36</span>, the roof of the tabernacle was also made before the boards. As we apply this to Christian experience, we should consider whether in our Christian life we begin from the bottom of the tabernacle or from the top. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3q2SJ7lUyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> The roof, or covering, of God’s habitation in the wilderness was of four layers. The first layer was fine linen, the second of goats’ hair, the third of rams’ skins dyed red, and the fourth of porpoise skins. In typology these layers do not refer to the believers, but only to Christ. The first layer typifies Christ as a perfect and complete human being; the second layer typifies Him as the One who was made sin for us and who died on the cross for our sins; the third layer typifies Him as the One who accomplished redemption to meet both God’s need and ours; and the fourth layer typifies Him as the One who is strong toward the enemy and who is able to resist all his attacks. No aspect of these four layers signifies the believers in any way. Therefore, the believers do not have any part in the layers of the covering. This covering is absolutely and thoroughly Christ Himself. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1130" id="1130">[1130]</span> </p>

These boards typify the believers built together to be the dwelling place of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35923" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">Eph. 2:22</span>). Therefore, we have the assurance to say that the tabernacle typifies not only the individual Christ, but also the corporate Christ. The believers, typified by the boards overlaid with gold, are covered with Christ Himself. Although the believers are not included in the four layers of the covering, Christ is involved with the boards which form the walls of the tabernacle. We know this by the fact that the boards were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold, the same materials used to make the ark, which is a type of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4flZI07UCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> Before we were saved, we were not the boards in God’s tabernacle. We did not have acacia wood, and we were not overlaid with gold. According to the natural life, we are not boards. But according to the divine life in resurrection, we are the standing boards of the tabernacle. Now we have become acacia wood overlaid with gold. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNP335f6BP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> Just as the ark was made of two elements, acacia wood and gold, so are the boards constructed of the same two elements. This indicates that the boards are the enlargement and extension of the ark. They are the same as the ark in substance, with the two natures of wood and gold. This portrays the fact that we the believers, who are the components of the wall of the tabernacle, are the enlargement of Christ, His extension. Do you realize that you are part of the extension of Christ? As members of the Body, we are His reproduction, continuation, increase, duplication, and spread. We are also His enlargement and extension. Just as a person’s body is the extension and enlargement of his head, so we, the Body of Christ, are the enlargement, continuation, extension, and spread of Christ the Head. Therefore, all the boards in the tabernacle are the extension and enlargement of the ark. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_c2ojTkmclAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> The dimensions of the ark were two and a half cubits in <span class="pg" data-page-id="1131" id="1131">[1131]</span> length and one and a half cubits in width and height. The dimensions of the tabernacle were thirty cubits in length and ten cubits in both width and height. As we compare the tabernacle and the ark, we see that the tabernacle is truly the enlargement and extension of the ark. In the same principle, we, the believers, are the enlargement and extension of Christ. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He lived and traveled in a very restricted area. But today the corporate Christ covers the entire earth. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3p3q2SJ93EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA">II. THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE ARK</h2><p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc9mA-vN2w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> The tabernacle includes not only the individual Christ, but also Christ and the believers in a corporate way. On the one hand, the boards typify the believers; on the other hand, the boards are also related to Christ. The reason for this is that Christ has made us part of Himself. We are no longer in Adam; we are in Christ and have even become part of Christ. The corporate Christ is under the covering of the individual Christ. We do not have any part in the ark or in the four layers of the covering. However, although we are not the enlargement of the covering, we are the enlargement of the ark. The covering is mainly for redemption, but the ark is mainly for testimony. We do not have any part in Christ’s redemptive work. It would be blasphemy to say that we share in Christ’s work of redemption. But we can say that we have a part, a share, in Christ’s testimony, for we are joined to the witnessing Christ and have become His enlargement. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC44XI-H6C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> At this point let us return to the question we raised at the beginning of the message: In our Christian experience do we begin with the top of the tabernacle or with the bottom? The tabernacle typifies the church. Does the church come into existence from the top down, or from the bottom up? The Bible does not reveal a church that comes into being from the bottom up. On the contrary, according to the Bible, the church comes into existence from the top downward. This is indicated by the fact that the record in Exodus begins with the roof of the tabernacle, not with the boards. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1132" id="1132">[1132]</span> Therefore, the fact that the covering comes before the boards indicates that the redemption of Christ must come first. This reveals that our Christian experience begins with the top, with the roof, not with the bottom. If Christ had not become a man to die on the cross for our sins in order to accomplish redemption, fulfill God’s requirements, and withstand the attacks of the enemy, there would be no way for us to be God’s people. The gospel is actually Christ typified by the four-layered covering of the tabernacle. When we preach the gospel, we preach this four-layered Christ. When we heard the gospel and believed into Christ, our Christian life began from above, with the roof. Our natural life, on the contrary, began from the bottom, in fact, from the very lowest level. This is the reason the layers of the roof are revealed first. Before we were regenerated, the roof, the four-layered Christ, was already in existence. Therefore, our Christian experience begins not from the bottom, but with the roof. When we believed in the Lord and received Him, we immediately found ourselves under the roof, under the covering. </p>

ACACIA WOOD OVERLAID WITH GOLD</h2><p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG8NKe1K2xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> After I was saved, I knew I had been regenerated, but I had no understanding of what had taken place within me. I did not know that I had become a board of acacia wood overlaid with gold. I realized simply that I had been saved and that henceforth I should do my best to glorify God. This concept, of course, is positive. It is wonderful to know that we have been saved and to desire to bring glory to God. However, this knowledge is natural; it does not contain any divine light. It is merely to know that once we were sinners bound for hell, but now, as saved ones destined for heaven, we should behave ourselves properly for the glory of God. It is crucial to realize that when we were saved and regenerated, a change took place in our being. We were fallen and were sinking lower and lower. But when we believed in Christ, He came into us, and we became buoyant. We experienced a change in nature, for a new element was added into <span class="pg" data-page-id="1133" id="1133">[1133]</span> our being. This element is nothing less than Christ Himself. Thus, through regeneration we have become acacia wood overlaid with gold. We have the uplifted humanity of Jesus and His divine nature. Now our new being is part of the enlargement of the ark. </p>

<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZcwj85W8JlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> Before we consider the tenons, sockets, rings, and bars, I would like to say a word about the corner boards and also about the total number of boards in the tabernacle. I appreciate the concept that there must be strengthening at the corners of the tabernacle. As we pointed out in the foregoing message, a corner is where a turn is made. Whenever the Lord makes a turn, there is the need for strengthening and reinforcement. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-QMwcNi4s4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> The Lord Jesus is not only the foundation of the church; He is also the cornerstone connecting the walls. He joins the Gentile wall to the Jewish wall. At Antioch there was a turn toward the Gentile world. Thus, there was a need for Christ to be the cornerstone to embrace the two sections of the church wall, the Jewish wall and the Gentile wall. At this corner there was the need for strengthening. If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35937" data-verses="Acts 13:1">Acts 13</span> carefully, we shall see that there definitely was a strengthening when the Lord made a turn at Antioch. We are told that in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers. As they were praying and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35938" data-verses="Acts 13:2">v. 2</span>). These brothers were burdened by the Lord to take the testimony to the Gentile world. To be sure, both Barnabas and Saul were corner boards. They were doubled and strengthened in order to become stronger boards for the building of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cB1gMVTRiWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> From 1922 until 1949, the Lord used China as a nursery for the planting of His recovery. But in 1949 the Lord took a <span class="pg" data-page-id="1142" id="1142">[1142]</span> major turn from the mainland of China to Taiwan. As one who participated in this turn in a full way, I was put under immense pressure, and I could say that I was thereby condensed and doubled. I can also testify that in this turn there was the strengthening. In the years to come, the Lord will probably make other turns in His recovery. Certain saints will be doubled, condensed, and strengthened in order to be the corner boards for such a turn. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTr7uAMrQmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> There was a total of forty-eight boards in the tabernacle. The number forty-eight can be formed with either four times twelve or six times eight. I believe that with the tabernacle the correct way to make this number is six times eight. In the record concerning the boards there is no mention of the number twelve, but there is mention of the number six and an indication of the number eight. The number six refers to man created on the sixth day. This man became fallen and was later redeemed. Therefore, six refers to created, fallen, and redeemed human beings. The number eight is the number of resurrection. Thus, six times eight means that, as the standing boards in the tabernacle, the believers have been created, have become fallen, and then have been redeemed and resurrected. We all have the same history. We were created, we became fallen, we were redeemed, and now we are in resurrection. Thus, we are a redeemed people in resurrection. This is the significance of the number of the boards being forty-eight. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyJN8y00OaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB">VI. THE TENONS</h2><p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-Dwlz8Mx7qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> There must be a way for the forty-eight boards of the tabernacle to stand up. For God’s building, the boards must be vertical. They cannot lie flat. Lying flat would be a sign of defeat. In order for the boards to stand upright, there is the need for the tenons, the sockets, the rings, and the bars. The tenons and the sockets are for standing, whereas the rings and the bars are for uniting. The individual boards of the tabernacle must become a corporate entity. This requires a uniting power to join them and make them one. The tenons <span class="pg" data-page-id="1143" id="1143">[1143]</span> and the sockets are for us individually, but the rings and the bars are for us to be joined together corporately. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNFR9oHDbKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35939" data-verses="Exodus 26:17">Verse 17</span> says, “Two tenons shall be in each board, connected one with the other; thus you shall make for all the boards of the tabernacle.” We do not know the details concerning the size, the shape, or the material of the tenons. The Hebrew word rendered tenons is difficult to translate. This word actually means a hand. Thus, the two tenons are two hands. The number two here signifies testimony and confirmation for coordination. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf4h8LoqRmndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr">VII. THE SOCKETS</h2><p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoabPbWzqNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35940" data-verses="Exodus 26:19">Verse 19</span> says, “And you shall make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards, two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.” These sockets signify stability for standing. They were made of silver, signifying the redemption of Christ as the base for the believers’ standing for God’s dwelling place (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35941" data-verses="Exodus 30:12-16">30:12-16</span>). There were two sockets under each board for its tenons, which made forty on the north side and forty on the south side, signifying being tested and tried for a testimony. Altogether there were ninety-six silver sockets for the boards. This number, composed of twelve times eight, signifies the completion of the divine administration in resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bVEh3NEKXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> Just as we are not told the size and shape of the tenons, neither are we told the size and shape of the sockets. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35942" data-verses="Exodus 38:27">38:27</span>, each socket was a talent of silver, weighing approximately one hundred pounds. But we do not know if the sockets were round, square, or rectangular. I prefer to believe that they were square in order to bear the weight of the building with its four layers of covering. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJt4fO--Uiqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> At this point we need to ask what the two tenons on each board signify. These tenons were not merely connected to the sockets, but they fit into the sockets and actually became one with them. The sockets were solid and weighty and had holes to contain the tenons. Because the sockets were made of silver signifying redemption, I believe that the two tenons <span class="pg" data-page-id="1144" id="1144">[1144]</span> refer to our faith. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35943" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> the children of Israel were commanded to pay a half shekel each for redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35944" data-verses="Exodus 30:12-16">vv. 12-16</span>). This silver was used to make the sockets. As we have pointed out, there were ninety-six sockets for the standing boards. Later we shall see that there were four additional sockets of silver used to support the pillars which held up the veil separating the Holy of Holies from the Holy Place. Thus, there were one hundred sockets of silver, each one weighing about one hundred pounds. This means that the base of the tabernacle consisted of ten thousand pounds of silver. In typology, silver signifies redemption. All the sockets of silver typify the solid redemption of Christ as the base of our standing in God’s building. We do not stand on sinking sand—we stand on Christ’s redemption. Christ has redeemed us, and now His redemption is our solid standing. Christ’s redemption is a socket in which the two tenons are placed. </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRA2IKgmi2TX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> I believe that the two tenons on each board signify our faith in Christ’s redemption. Our standing is by faith. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35945" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:24">2 Corinthians 1:24</span> Paul says, “In faith you stand.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35946" data-verses="Romans 5:2">Romans 5:2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35947" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">Galatians 5:1</span> Paul speaks of standing. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35948" data-verses="Romans 5:2">Romans 5:2</span> says, “Through whom also we have the access by faith into this grace in which we stand.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35949" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">Galatians 5:1</span> says, “For freedom Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore.” The tenons signify our faith by which we stand. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTN8iRVRfNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> Now we must go on to ask why there are two tenons on each board. If the tenons signify our faith, why are there two instead of just one? The answer is that these two tenons signify a complete faith. A simple illustration will help us in our understanding. In a pair of eyeglasses there are two lenses, one for each eye. But these two lenses make up one pair of glasses. Although we have two eyes, we have one field of vision. It would certainly be a serious problem if we had double vision. When a pair of glasses is properly prescribed, we have one clear field of vision. As the two lenses make one pair of glasses, so the two tenons are one complete faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq5QRplOfEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> We have seen that the number two signifies confirmation, testimony, and coordination. Genuine faith always includes these three aspects. If our faith in the Lord Jesus is <span class="pg" data-page-id="1145" id="1145">[1145]</span> genuine, it will have a testimony, confirmation, and coordination. Otherwise, our faith is questionable. A proper faith is one that is testified and confirmed and that has a proper coordination. Just as it takes two half-steps, one with each foot, to make a complete step, so we need two tenons in order to have a complete faith. </p>

<p class="scripture" data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-l2AkgEc8l6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD">Scripture Reading: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35959" data-verses="Exodus 26:31-35">Exo. 26:31-35</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35960" data-verses="Exodus 36:35-36">36:35-36</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35961" data-verses="Exodus 40:3">40:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35962" data-verses="Exodus 40:21">21</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlBptD71fFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> It is difficult to understand why there was a veil within the tabernacle. If we consider the situation of the tabernacle as a whole, we may be puzzled by the fact that there was a veil separating the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. The tabernacle was a tent thirty cubits in length, ten cubits in width, and ten cubits in height. The veil served as a partition between the Holy of Holies and the Holy Place. This veil was a curtain of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen. It was the work of a skillful workman, and it was made with cherubim. In color and design it was exactly the same as the ceiling of the tabernacle, the first layer of the covering. Whenever a priest came into the tabernacle, he would immediately notice that the ceiling and the veil were the same. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Btujj74Mk5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> The Holy of Holies was a cube measuring ten cubits in each direction. The Holy Place was twenty cubits in length and ten cubits in both width and height. The term Holy of Holies is a Hebrew expression meaning the most holy place, the holiest of all. The crucial question is why there had to be a separation between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. For what purpose was the tent divided into two rooms? Whenever we build a house with rooms or erect a partition in a room, we have a specific purpose. The various rooms in a house each have a particular purpose, and each room contains furniture suitable to it. For example, the furniture in the bedroom is very different from that in the living room. The Holy of Holies contained only one piece of furniture—the ark. In the Holy Place there were the table of the bread <span class="pg" data-page-id="1152" id="1152">[1152]</span> of the presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar. Whenever a priest came into the Holy Place, he first went to the table for nourishment. After being nourished at the table, he would go to the lampstand to trim it and add oil to it so that it would shine brightly. Following this, he would go to the incense altar. As we shall see in a later message, both the incense altar and the incense offered at this altar are types of Christ. Through Christ as the sweet fragrance to God typified by the incense, we can enter into the Holy of Holies, the very place where God stays, where He meets with us, and where He communes with us. In the Holy of Holies, where God’s shekinah glory is, we have fellowship with Him. Although we know what was in the Holy Place, we still need to see why there was the need to have a veil, a curtain, separating the ark of the testimony in the Holy of Holies from the table and the lampstand in the Holy Place. We still need to find out why there was the need of a partition to separate the tabernacle into two sections. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_Gtal6W_5KauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M">TYPIFYING THE FLESH OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQa9SNs7iwajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35963" data-verses="Hebrews 10:20">Hebrews 10:20</span>, the veil signifies the flesh of Christ. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, the veil in the temple was rent from the top to the bottom. This means that through death the veil of Christ’s flesh was cleft. What is difficult to understand is the significance of the veil within the tabernacle being placed on four pillars. The pillars are different from the boards. We have seen that on the north, west, and south sides of the tabernacle there was a total of forty-eight boards. On the east side, instead of boards, there was a curtain, called the first veil. Thus, the veil within the tabernacle may be called the second veil. The first veil was put on five pillars, and the second veil was put on four pillars. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m5PIoCMoyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> As we have pointed out, the forty-eight boards of the tabernacle are not types of Christ. The most we can say is that they are types of the enlargement of Christ, or types of the enlarged Christ. We cannot say that the boards typify Christ directly, for these boards are types of the believers <span class="pg" data-page-id="1153" id="1153">[1153]</span> who are the enlargement of Christ. Likewise, the four pillars upon which the second veil was placed are not types of Christ. Although the pillars differed from the boards in shape, they were made of the same materials—acacia wood overlaid with gold. Furthermore, they stood on a base of silver. Underneath each standing board were two sockets of silver in which the two tenons were firmly placed. There was a total of ninety-six sockets, two for each board. Each of the four pillars was placed in a silver socket. Thus, with the tabernacle there was a total of one hundred sockets of silver. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWh10fqmOovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> The fact that the pillars rest in sockets of silver is a further proof that the pillars typify the believers and not Christ Himself. Christ has no need of redemption to be His standing. However, the believers must have a firm standing, and this standing, as signified by the silver sockets, is the redemption of Christ. Both the boards and the pillars are believers who stand on Christ’s redemption. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-2D_0Ye189qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS">THE BOARDS AND THE PILLARS</h2><p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB5CLCfIi6RI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> Since both the boards and the pillars typify the believers, we may ask what is the difference between the pillars and the boards. The pillars typify believers, but extraordinary believers, not ordinary ones. The forty-eight boards typify ordinary believers. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35964" data-verses="Galatians 2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>, Peter, John, and James were pillars. These extraordinary disciples of the Lord Jesus were pillars in the church. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35965" data-verses="Revelation 3:12">Revelation 3:12</span> the Lord says that the overcomers will become pillars in the temple of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flZcwz8-FcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> In every local church there should be some pillars. In God’s house, God’s dwelling place, there is the need not only for boards, but also for pillars. In the tabernacle the pillars were one-twelfth the number of the boards. I hope that all the elders in the churches are pillars. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol-QMgcLxIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> Now we come to another difficult question: Why was the veil, a type of Christ, placed on pillars, which typify extraordinary believers? According to the picture portrayed by the type, when Christ became flesh, He was placed on the believers. But why was Christ in the flesh put on the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1154" id="1154">[1154]</span> believers? Now we have two difficult questions to answer, one concerning why there was a separation within the tabernacle and the other concerning why Christ was put on the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cB1gMFTYxWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35966" data-verses="Exodus 26:31">Exodus 26:31</span> says, “And you shall make a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; the work of a skillful workman shall it be made, with cherubim.” We have pointed out that the veil is the same as the first layer of the covering of the tabernacle. This means that the separation is the same as the ceiling in material, color, workmanship, and embroidery. Blue means heavenly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35967" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:47-48">1 Cor. 15:47-48</span>), purple signifies royalty (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35968" data-verses="John 19:19-22">John 19:19-22</span>), scarlet typifies the shedding of blood for redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="35969" data-verses="Hebrews 9:22">Heb. 9:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35970" data-verses="1Peter 1:18-19">1 Pet. 1:18-19</span>), twined linen signifies the fine living of Christ manifested through suffering and trials, and the embroidered cherubim typify the work of the Spirit on Christ to make the glory of God manifested in the creature. When Christ was on earth, He lived a very fine human life. This living was manifested through sufferings and trials. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUTr7-AE4AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35971" data-verses="Exodus 26:32">Exodus 26:32</span> goes on to say, “And you shall put it upon four pillars of acacia wood overlaid with gold; and their hooks shall be of gold, upon four sockets of silver.” In the Bible the number four signifies creatures. The four pillars standing on four sockets of silver signify the redeemed creatures. </p>

It is not our purpose simply to know the pattern, materials, and measurements of the tabernacle in a doctrinal way. In the New Testament Paul established a good example of studying and interpreting the Old Testament types. Instead of applying these types in a doctrinal way, Paul applied them in an experiential way, either to Christ Himself or to the believers. Following his example, our emphasis will not be on the doctrinal significance of the types. Rather, we need to pray that we may be brought into the proper spiritual understanding of the types so that we may receive help in our spiritual life. In this message we shall consider the spiritual significance of the veil hanging on the pillars within the tabernacle. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCt85B2LvVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR">TWO TABERNACLES</h2><p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLR9Xkj9JfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> Concerning the veil hanging on the pillars, we need to consider further why there was the need to have a veil separating the tabernacle into two parts. The Old Testament speaks of just one tabernacle. But when Paul refers to the tabernacle in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35995" data-verses="Hebrews 9:1">Hebrews 9</span>, he speaks of a first and a second tabernacle. If Paul had not written these words, we would not have the boldness to speak of two tabernacles. Instead, we would say that there was one tabernacle with <span class="pg" data-page-id="1164" id="1164">[1164]</span> two sections, an inner section called the Holy of Holies and an outer section called the Holy Place. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35996" data-verses="Hebrews 9:2-3">Hebrews 9:2 and 3</span> say, “For a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which were both the lampstand and the table and the loaves set forth, which is called the Holy Place; and after the second veil, a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35997" data-verses="Hebrews 9:2">verse 2</span>, the Holy Place was the first tabernacle. Paul’s reference to “the second veil” indicates that he must have regarded the curtain at the entrance to the Holy Place as the first veil. The first veil was at the entrance to the first tabernacle, the Holy Place, and the second veil was at the entrance to the second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35998" data-verses="Hebrews 9:6-7">Hebrews 9:6 and 7</span> Paul speaks of the first and second tabernacles. Why did he regard the one tabernacle as two tabernacles? When Paul was writing the book of Hebrews, he was heavily burdened by the fact that the Hebrew Christians still held the Old Testament concept regarding many things. Therefore, Paul was burdened to show them that the old tabernacle was absolutely over. He considered that the tabernacle was actually two tabernacles, not one tabernacle with two sections. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG5g-RjvPiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> There is an important difference between two tabernacles and one. For example, there is quite a difference between a duplex and two houses. According to the Old Testament, the tabernacle was a duplex. But according to Paul’s writing in Hebrews, it was two houses. There is nothing contradictory here, for both the Old Testament and the New Testament are accurate. The crucial matter is our understanding. When Paul was writing Hebrews, his feeling was so strong and his understanding was such that he considered the tabernacle in the Old Testament as two separate tabernacles, just as the old covenant and the new covenant are two distinct covenants. We cannot say that the two covenants are one covenant with two sections. In like manner, Paul regarded the tabernacle as two tabernacles, not as one tabernacle with two sections. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJ1gRVRdNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="35999" data-verses="Hebrews 9:8-9">Hebrews 9:8 and 9</span> say, “The Holy Spirit showing by this, that the way of the Holy of Holies has not yet been <span class="pg" data-page-id="1165" id="1165">[1165]</span> manifested while the first tabernacle still has its standing; which is a figure for the present time.” Here Paul does not say “the first section of the tabernacle”; he speaks of “the first tabernacle” having its standing. The relative pronoun “which” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36000" data-verses="Hebrews 9:9">verse 9</span> refers not to standing, but to the first tabernacle. This pronoun is emphatic and refers definitely to the first tabernacle. This clearly indicates that the first tabernacle is a figure for the present time. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9ZTplOdEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> Bible translators and expositors have debated the meaning of the phrase “the present time.” This expression refers to the New Testament age. Thus, the first tabernacle was a type of the New Testament age. It was a figure, not the reality. Likewise, the table and the lampstand in the first tabernacle are also types, figures, not realities. Those in the Old Testament did not have the reality in the first tabernacle. What they had was only a type, a figure. We today have the reality. The first tabernacle was a picture, a figure, a type, of the present time, of the New Testament age. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfUHnmSxPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> Although the first tabernacle, the Holy Place, was a type, Paul does not say that the second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, was a type or figure. The reason for this is that the first tabernacle was a figure of the New Testament age, but the second tabernacle was the reality of the New Testament age. The showbread on the table in the Holy Place was not a reality; it was not Christ Himself. Rather, it typified Christ. Hence, it was a figure. Likewise, the lampstand shining in the Holy Place was also not Christ Himself shining. It was a figure, a type, of Christ. However, the shekinah glory of God in the Holy of Holies was a reality, not a type or a figure. God was actually in the second tabernacle. Therefore, when the high priest entered the Holy of Holies, he could actually see the glory of God and receive a word from God. Hence, the second tabernacle was not a figure of the New Testament age. Instead, to some extent, it was the reality of the New Testament age. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr8676T7e4ocJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> The two tabernacles also typify the two covenants—the old covenant and the new covenant. The first tabernacle, a type of the present age, signifies the old covenant. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="1166" id="1166">[1166]</span> second tabernacle, the reality of the New Testament age, signifies the new covenant. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnjacNXOmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2">SOUL OR SPIRIT?</h2><p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH6rTasYW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> According to the entire book of Hebrews, the first tabernacle, or the Holy Place, is a type or figure of our soul, whereas the second tabernacle, or the Holy of Holies, is a type of our spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36001" data-verses="Hebrews 4:16">Hebrews 4:16</span> says, “Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help.” We have seen that the throne of grace is the propitiatory cover upon the ark within the veil. To come forward to the throne of grace is to come forward to the propitiatory cover on the ark in the Holy of Holies. The word about the dividing of soul and spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36002" data-verses="Hebrews 4:12">Hebrews 4:12</span> is related to this: “For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.” When our soul is divided from our spirit, we are at the threshold of the spirit. This means that we are at the threshold of the Holy of Holies within which there is the throne of grace. The soul and the spirit are not two aspects of one thing, but are two distinct matters. The soul is typified by the first tabernacle, and the spirit is signified by the second. </p>

We may think that these verses are easy to understand. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36020" data-verses="Exodus 26:36">Verse 36</span> says, “And you shall make a curtain for the door of the tent of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of an embroiderer.” This verse speaks of a curtain for the door of the tent. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36021" data-verses="Exodus 26:37">Verse 37</span>, however, speaks of the screen: “And you shall make for the screen five pillars of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold; and their hooks shall be of gold; and you shall cast five sockets of bronze for them.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRE_KaggxmTX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO">THE COVERING, THE VEIL, AND THE SCREEN</h2><p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJ1gBVYPtP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> The curtain for the door of the tent was made of the same material as the first layer of the covering and the veil separating the Holy of Holies from the Holy Place. Thus, the ceiling, the inner veil, and the curtain for the door were made of the same material and of the same colors, design, and workmanship. Whenever a priest came into the tabernacle, he could see above, at the front, and at the rear curtains or a veil of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen. The inner curtain is called the veil, whereas the curtain for the door is called the screen. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9ZT5lGP0fCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> In his translation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36022" data-verses="Exodus 26:36">verse 36</span> J. N. Darby says, “And thou shalt make for the entrance of the tent a curtain.” Darby uses the word entrance instead of door. You may think that there is no difference between an entrance and a door. Although these words are similar in meaning, nevertheless an entrance denotes something more specific than a door. A <span class="pg" data-page-id="1174" id="1174">[1174]</span> door may be used both as an entrance and an exit, but an entrance is not an exit. It is for going in, but not for going out. The door in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36023" data-verses="Exodus 26:36">verse 36</span> serves both as an entrance and an exit. However, its primary purpose is to serve as an entrance, not an exit. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-_6KzFeZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> I agree with Darby’s rendering of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36024" data-verses="Exodus 26:36">verse 36</span>. Actually the front of the tabernacle did not have the appearance of a door. There were no doorposts, and there was no lintel. Instead, there was a curtain supported by five pillars to serve as an opening for an entrance. For this reason, I prefer to speak of a curtain for the entrance, instead of a curtain for the door. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMGPaIRj-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> We have pointed out that the veil separating the Holy of Holies from the Holy Place was the same in material and workmanship as the curtain, or screen, at the entrance of the tabernacle. But although they were the same in design and appearance, the one is called the veil and the other is called the screen. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbEKP9gI7HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> It is significant that the matters related to the tabernacle are described not from the outside in, but from the inside out. For example, the four layers of the covering are described from the innermost layer, that of the fine twined linen, to the outermost layer, that of the porpoise skins. Likewise, concerning the two curtains, the inner veil and the screen, the divine record first describes the inner veil and then the screen at the entrance of the tabernacle. It is important to understand the significance of both the veil and the screen. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0WQyMJujsWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> A veil hides something from our sight and keeps that thing away from our presence. Often a veil is used to conceal things that are very precious. When something is covered by a veil, we are separated from that thing. The precious things are not invisible, but we cannot see them because of the veil. In the tabernacle, certain precious things were covered with a veil, and fallen people could not see them. The ark in the Holy of Holies was the first of the precious things hidden from God’s people. We have seen that the ark signifies Christ as the embodiment of God. This ark is related to God’s history. God’s history includes all that He is and all <span class="pg" data-page-id="1175" id="1175">[1175]</span> that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained. All this is embodied in Christ as the ark. Furthermore, upon Christ as the ark there is a place called the propitiatory cover, where God can meet with us and speak to us. This is where God’s glory is expressed, as signified by the cherubim. In addition, the redeeming blood was sprinkled on this propitiatory cover, the lid of the ark. Therefore, with the ark we have God with His history, His embodiment, His expressed glory, and Christ’s redemption. How precious is the ark and all the things related to it! </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcNATIJBazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> In the Holy Place we have the table of the bread of the presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar. At the table we receive the life supply for our nourishment, at the lampstand we are enlightened, and at the incense altar we have Christ as the frankincense, which signifies Him as the sweet fragrance for God’s acceptance of us. Thus, in the Holy Place we have supply, enlightenment, and acceptance. Now we must go on to see that the contents of the ark—the tablets of the law, the hidden manna, and the budding rod—correspond to the three items in the Holy Place. In the Holy Place we have the bread, but in the Holy of Holies, the manna. This indicates that the bread in the Holy Place becomes the hidden manna in the Holy of Holies. Also, in the Holy Place we have the lampstand with its light, and in the Holy of Holies we have the law as God’s testimony. Thus, at one end, in the Holy Place, we are enlightened by the lampstand, but at the other end, in the Holy of Holies, we are enlightened by the law as God’s testimony. Furthermore, in the Holy Place we have the frankincense at the incense altar for our acceptance. But within the Holy of Holies we have the budding rod signifying the resurrection life becoming our acceptance. Thus, the incense in the Holy Place becomes the budding rod in the Holy of Holies. The budding rod and the frankincense both signify the resurrected Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h_CkgAPMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> The correspondence between the manna, the law, and the budding rod and the bread, the lampstand, and the incense altar can be illustrated by the correspondence between grace <span class="pg" data-page-id="1176" id="1176">[1176]</span> and truth in the Gospel of John and love and light in the First Epistle of John. On our side we have grace, but on God’s side grace is love. Likewise, on our side we have truth. But when we trace this truth to its source on God’s side, truth is light. Therefore, at our end we have grace and truth; at God’s end there are love and light. In like manner, the bread corresponds to the manna; the lampstand, to the tablets of the law; and the incense, to the budding rod. In the Holy Place we have the life supply of Christ, the light of Christ, and the incense, the acceptance, of Christ. But in the Holy of Holies, we have Christ Himself as our life supply, enlightenment, and acceptance. However, as long as we remain in our fallen nature, the ark with its precious contents is veiled from our sight and kept away from our presence. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFgvD7yMFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> It is significant that the outer veil, the curtain at the door of the tabernacle, is called in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36025" data-verses="Exodus 26:37">verse 37</span> a screen. The function of a screen is, on the one hand, to allow air to come in, but, on the other hand, to keep out insects and other pests. If we did not have screens on our windows, the way would be open for flies and mosquitoes to come in. As we shall see, the screen at the entrance to the tabernacle serves to keep all negative things out of God’s dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Fksjj9rck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> We have seen that the first layer of the covering, the veil, and the screen were all made of the same material with the same colors, design, and workmanship. However, this material is called by three different terms: the covering, the veil, and the screen. Material of the same color and with the same embroidery has three functions. First, it covers the standing boards; second, it veils the preciousness of the processed Triune God; and third, it keeps away negative things from God’s dwelling. We have seen that both the covering and the veil are Christ. With this understanding of the covering and the veil as a basis, we may rightly conclude that the screen also refers to Christ. </p>

But if we see only that the tabernacle is the dwelling place for God, our understanding will be superficial. We must go on to realize that a dwelling place is a place for enjoyment, not only for living. Your home is not simply the place where you live; it is also a place for enjoyment. To live without enjoyment is actually to suffer the killing of death. The reason people commit suicide is that they feel their living is meaningless, without any enjoyment. God’s dwelling place is the place for Him to be the enjoyment for His people. We may also say that it is the place where God’s chosen people participate in the full enjoyment of God Himself. It is crucial to see this matter. </p>

Through His all-inclusive death, this Christ has become the entrance for God’s people <span class="pg" data-page-id="1188" id="1188">[1188]</span> to come into the enjoyment of God. The two curtains signify the unique Christ and also Christ’s all-inclusive death. Christ died to take away our sins through the judgment of God He suffered. This judgment is indicated by the brass sockets under the pillars supporting the screen. Christ was fully judged by God on our behalf. Of course, in Himself Christ had no reason to suffer God’s judgment. In every way He was right with God and with man. He never did anything to deserve God’s judgment. But He was judged by God because of our sins. He died for our sins. The judgment through which He passed has become the brass sockets as the base on which we stand. This means that we stand on the judgment Christ suffered for our sins. Paul preached this as the first aspect of the gospel. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36043" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:3">1 Corinthians 15:3</span> he says, “For I delivered to you, among the first things, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.” Thus, in the gospel preached by Paul we see, as the first item, that Christ died for our sins. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZwJzh29LYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> In the book of 2 Corinthians Paul goes deeper. We may say that 1 Corinthians is partially in the outer court and partially in the Holy Place. Second Corinthians, however, is in the Holy of Holies. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36044" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:14">2 Corinthians 5:14</span> Paul says that Christ died for all. Not only did He die for our sins—He died for us. In His death we also were crucified. His crucifixion thus included all His believers. For this reason, Paul concludes that because One has died for all, then all are dead. This is not the first item of the gospel. It is more of an inward matter than the outward matter of Christ dying for our sins. This outward matter brings us into the Holy Place, but the inward matter brings us into the Holy of Holies. </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneDKN97LVHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> In contrast to 1 Corinthians, the book of 2 Corinthians does not reveal a life partly in the outer court and partly in the Holy Place; it reveals a life in the Holy of Holies, a life which has passed through the riven veil. Second Corinthians is a book of a life in the Holy of Holies. This life is a life of resurrection through crucifixion. As ministers of the New Testament, the apostles lived a crucified life for the manifestation of the resurrection life. Thus, they could enter the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1189" id="1189">[1189]</span> Holy of Holies, for they had passed through the two curtains; they had passed through the screen and the veil. This means that they had passed through the judgment of God upon Christ for their sins and also through the crucifixion of the flesh by the death of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36045" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:11-12">2 Corinthians 4:11 and 12</span> Paul says, “For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh. So then death operates in us, but life in you.” Paul was daily delivered to death so that the resurrection life might be manifested in him. This indicates that he had passed through the riven veil in order to live in the Holy of Holies. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbouySQxwzBoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN">CHRIST AS A SCREEN</h2><p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83HuxavzSXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> One aspect of Christ’s humanity is that of a screen. In His humanity the Person revealed, described, and portrayed in the four Gospels was a screen. If we read the Gospels from this angle, we shall see that Christ is a screen keeping all the negative things away from God’s dwelling place. The life described in the four Gospels is such a screen. Every negative thing and every negative person is screened out. The Pharisees and the Sadducees were screened out by the Person of Jesus Christ. Because the Lord Jesus was a screen, the Pharisees and Sadducees could not enter into the enjoyment of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCkdDovSJvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> Whenever a sinner meets the perfect humanity of the Lord Jesus, he is either screened out, or he is subdued and convinced to believe in Christ. If he believes in Him, the screen will immediately become an entrance through which he may come into the Holy Place, where he begins to enjoy God in Christ and to participate in the rich enjoyment of what Christ is. In the Holy Place such a redeemed sinner can enjoy Christ as the life supply, as enlightenment, and as his acceptance by God. This is not a mere doctrine; rather, it is a description of our experience. From experience we know that redeemed sinners can pass through the screen, enter the Holy Place, and enjoy all the riches of God in Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1190" id="1190">[1190]</span> </p>

He also realizes that his fallen nature, the flesh, is a separation, a veil. Even though he has enjoyed a rich portion of the Lord, now he knows that there is something richer that he is not yet able to touch because of this separating veil. Eventually, he sees in the Bible that Christ’s death not only deals with his sins, but also deals with the flesh. The Lord’s death has rent, torn, the flesh. Spontaneously, by the indwelling Spirit, such a believer crucifies his flesh; that is, he puts his fallen nature to death. Furthermore, the Spirit works to arrange circumstances which will cause him to be put into death. In this way he experientially passes through the riven veil. The chorus of a hymn says, </p>

<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fVx127ANcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> In the tabernacle there were two veils, or two curtains. The first veil, located at the entrance to the Holy Place, was called the screen; the second curtain, separating the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies, was called the veil. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36058" data-verses="Exodus 26:1">Chapter twenty-six</span> of Exodus speaks first of the inner veil and then of the screen. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36059" data-verses="Exodus 26:31">Verse 31</span> says, “And you shall make a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; the work of a skillful workman shall it be made, with cherubim.” This was the veil which made a separation between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36060" data-verses="Exodus 26:33">v. 33</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36061" data-verses="Exodus 26:36-37">Verses 36 and 37</span> say, “And you shall make a curtain for the door of the tent of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of an embroiderer. And you shall make for the screen five pillars of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.” As we have pointed out in the foregoing messages, these two veils signify two aspects of the all-inclusive death of Christ. The screen indicates that Christ died for our sins so that our sins may be forgiven and that we may be justified by God. The inner veil indicates that Christ died for us so that our flesh, our fallen nature, may be rent, or torn, and that we may enter the Holy of Holies to enjoy God to the uttermost. </p>

For many years I was puzzled by this chapter, especially by Paul’s appeal to the Corinthians <span class="pg" data-page-id="1196" id="1196">[1196]</span> to be reconciled to God. In this chapter Paul is definitely dealing not with unbelievers, but with believers. Nevertheless, he concludes this chapter with a word about reconciliation. Why in speaking to believers does Paul refer to his ministry as a ministry of reconciliation? Had those in Corinth not already been reconciled to God? Since they were genuine believers, they no doubt had been reconciled. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36063" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:19">Second Corinthians 5:19</span> says, “God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not accounting their offenses to them, and putting in us the word of reconciliation.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36064" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:20">verse 20</span> Paul goes on to say, “On behalf of Christ, then, we are ambassadors, as God entreating through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God.” We need to see that here Paul speaks of reconciliation in two ways, or in two aspects. One aspect is related to sinners; the other aspect, to believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL-25fyT_8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> If we know the significance of the veil and the screen in the tabernacle, we shall be able to understand how Paul deals with the Corinthian believers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36065" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">2 Corinthians 5</span>. The Corinthians had passed through the first veil, the screen, at the entrance to the tabernacle. But they had not yet passed through the second veil, the inner veil, the veil separating the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. This means that they had not experienced both aspects of the reconciliation between us and God. Before the Corinthians believed in Christ and were saved, they were enemies to God. But when they believed in Christ, they were reconciled to God. They were forgiven, they were justified, and they could enter into the Holy Place to have a certain enjoyment of the Lord. However, although the Corinthians had experienced this aspect of reconciliation, they had not entered into the Holy of Holies. They had been reconciled to God to some extent, but not to the extent of being able to come into the Holy of Holies to enjoy God in full. For this reason, they needed a further reconciliation, the reconciliation Paul speaks of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36066" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:20">2 Corinthians 5:20</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_CkYF6ftZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36067" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:3">1 Corinthians 15:3</span> Paul says, “For I delivered to you, among the first things, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.” Here <span class="pg" data-page-id="1197" id="1197">[1197]</span> Paul emphasizes the basic gospel truth that Christ died for our sins. This is related to the first aspect of reconciliation. The goal of reconciliation is to take away the barrier between us and God. When we experience forgiveness and justification and enter the Holy Place, the barrier is taken away to a certain extent. However, a particular aspect of the barrier remains, and this aspect is our flesh, our fallen nature. Concerning our sins, we have been forgiven and reconciled to God. But concerning our flesh, our fallen nature, we may not yet be reconciled to God. Rather, we still may be separated from Him, unable to enjoy Him in the Holy of Holies. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQe0QtszwAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> The Corinthian believers were genuine brothers in Christ, and Paul repeatedly addressed them as such. Nevertheless, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36068" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:20">2 Corinthians 5:20</span> he beseeches them to be reconciled to God. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36069" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">verse 21</span> he goes on to say, “Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God’s righteousness in Him.” This is deeper than Christ dying for our sins. For Christ to be made sin for us so that we may become the righteousness of God is different from Christ dying so that we may have our sins forgiven and be justified by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755Tx-jLj89jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36070" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">2 Corinthians 5</span> carefully, we shall see that there are in fact two aspects of reconciliation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36071" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:19">verse 19</span> Paul says that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself. Notice that concerning the reconciling of the world to God, Paul does not tell us that Christ was made sin. On the contrary, he simply says that God did not reckon their offenses unto them. This aspect of reconciliation involves sinners, as indicated by Paul’s use of the word “world.” But according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36072" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:20">verse 20</span>, even the reconciled ones, the believers, still need to be reconciled. In these verses we see three classes of people: the apostles, sinners, and believers who have not been fully reconciled to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoACvDTw6BePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> Most Christian preachers today speak only of the first aspect of reconciliation, the aspect of God not reckoning sinners’ offenses against them. Few, if any, speak of the second aspect of reconciliation, the aspect related to Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="1198" id="1198">[1198]</span> becoming sin so that we may become the righteousness of God in Him. This aspect, which is much deeper than the first, is signified by the second veil in the tabernacle. Only when we pass through this veil are we thoroughly reconciled to God and able to enjoy Him in full. </p>

The Son of God was sent in the likeness of the flesh of sin and then, on the cross, He was made sin for us. When Christ was on the cross, God condemned sin in the flesh. This means that God crucified, killed, the flesh, including sin, which is actually Satan himself. God condemned sin in the flesh so that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit. The flesh dealt with in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36077" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36078" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">2 Corinthians 5</span> is illustrated by the inner veil in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36079" data-verses="Exodus 26:1">Exodus 26</span>. If we did not have the veil in the tabernacle as a type, we could not have a full understanding that the flesh must be dealt with. We have seen that the rending of the inner veil signifies the tearing of our flesh. </p>

In many cases, they may not even be in the outer court. It is possible that the Corinthians knew the apostles according to their soulish understanding, for many of them were in the Holy Place, which signifies the soul. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36081" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:17">verse 17</span> Paul speaks of the new creation: “So that if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things <span class="pg" data-page-id="1199" id="1199">[1199]</span> have passed away; behold, they have become new.” To be a new creation means to be absolutely new.

As far as the tabernacle itself is concerned, the most difficult matter is the corner boards. No one has been able to solve the problem of these corner boards. The record concerning the altar is even more difficult to understand. However, we have a way to escape this problem: it is to follow the spiritual and experiential way. Literally, according to the record in black and white, certain points are extremely difficult for anyone to understand. But if we come into the realm of spiritual understanding and experience, we can be saved from this trouble. Therefore, I would remind you once again that our approach to the book of Exodus in this life-study is not doctrinal; on the contrary, it is experiential. This means that we want to consider every matter from the standpoint of our spiritual experience. If a particular matter does not apply to our Christian experience, I would prefer not to talk about it. What is the profit of speaking about something that has nothing to do with our experience of Christ? We do not want to speak in a vain way. Instead, we want to utter what is real and understandable according to our experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl83PqgcYvIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> Let us first consider the position of the altar. There were two altars, one inside the tabernacle, and the other outside the tabernacle, in the outer court. The altar inside the tabernacle was called the incense altar and was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. It was much smaller than the altar of the burnt offering in the outer court. The incense altar <span class="pg" data-page-id="1204" id="1204">[1204]</span> was more vertical than horizontal; that is, it was taller than it was wide. At this altar those who came into God’s dwelling place could have a very close relationship with God, for there the incense was burned to Him. At this altar there was no shedding of blood. Instead, there was the burning of incense to offer a sweet-smelling savor to God. At the altar of the burnt offering, however, sacrifices were offered with the shedding of blood. Furthermore, the offerings were burned there. The burning of the sacrifices at the altar in the outer court was for redemption, but the burning of the incense at the incense altar was for God’s acceptance. It was necessary for fire to be brought in from the outer altar to burn the incense on the inner altar. Hence, these two burnings are by one kind of fire. The fire on the altar of the burnt offering burns the sacrifices; the fire at the incense altar burns the incense. One kind of fire, therefore, burns two kinds of substances. Since there were two altars related to the tabernacle, we need to understand what altar is referred to whenever we read about the altar in the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yK8kYXn89qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> In the Holy of Holies there was just one item of furniture—the ark. In the Holy Place there were the table, the lampstand, and the incense altar. In the outer court the altar of the burnt offering and the laver were located. According to the interpretation given in the New Testament, the outer court signifies the earth, and the entire tabernacle, including both the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, signifies the heavens. Thus, to be in the outer court is to be on earth, but to be in the tabernacle is to be in the heavens. Do you know how you can be in the heavens? Do not listen to the superficial teaching that you can be in the heavens only after you die. Actually, the tabernacle is Christ. As long as you are in Christ, you are in the heavens. But whenever you are outside of Christ, you are on earth. Based on this principle, we may say that daily we may go to the heavens a number of times. Perhaps before coming to a church meeting you are, experientially speaking, on earth. But when you are in the meeting, you get into the heavens. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1205" id="1205">[1205]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9LISfAwqRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> If we consider a diagram of the tabernacle and the outer court, we see that the ark and the altar of the burnt offering are at two ends. In the universe there are actually just two parties: God and man. (Satan, who may be considered the third party, will ultimately be cast into the lake of fire.) The two ends are related to these two parties, to God and man. God’s end is at the ark, and man’s end is at the altar of the burnt offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8aoq-JiqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> Does the record of the tabernacle in Exodus begin from God’s end or from man’s end? The record begins from God’s end, for it begins with the ark. The description of the ark begins the divine record concerning the tabernacle. This indicates that the record begins from God and proceeds toward man. However, when man comes to the tabernacle, he does not begin from God’s end. He begins at the altar, that is, he begins from man’s end. Whenever a person comes to the tabernacle, the first thing he meets is the altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5E43HIH4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> God does not dwell at the altar, but He dwells at the ark, where the throne of grace is. Anyone who wanted to meet God would have to travel through all the items of the tabernacle until he comes to the ark. However, God has already come to us. He came from the heavens to the earth, and the altar was the destination of His coming. Christ came from the heavens to the earth, and during His last hours on earth He went to the cross. On the cross He terminated the old creation and redeemed His chosen people. As we have pointed out, redemption implies termination, replacement, and being brought back to God. As the book of Hebrews indicates, Christ’s coming to the earth in this way was once for all. But man’s going to God is not once for all. Rather, it is a continual matter, a daily matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fVwF28SNcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> When God came from His dwelling place to the earth and went to the cross, what was His main intention, His main goal? His main goal was to bring man to Himself. This means that God came out of the tabernacle to bring man into the tabernacle. However, most believers still linger around the cross; few have been brought into the tabernacle. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1206" id="1206">[1206]</span> Every week a great many sermons are given to Christians, yet few of these sermons are a means to bring saved sinners into the tabernacle. At best, such sermons may bring people to God at the altar. Some may argue that God is omnipresent and that as long as a person repents and believes in the Lord Jesus, he turns to God. In a sense, this is correct. But the New Testament indicates that if we are still around the altar, we are not in the tabernacle with God. We need to go to the showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar, and eventually reach the ark. There on the ark we have the propitiation-cover, the throne of grace spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36107" data-verses="Hebrews 4:16">Hebrews 4:16</span>: “Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help.” </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vRvStrhF6d_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> When we reach the throne of grace, we are not only in the presence of God—we are even in God Himself. There we and God are one. In the words of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36108" data-verses="Colossians 3:3">Colossians 3:3</span>, our life is hidden with Christ in God. The God who hides us is not at the altar; He is at the ark. Furthermore, we are hidden in God not at the altar, but at the ark. God has come out of the tabernacle in order to bring us into the tabernacle, to bring us to the very place where He dwells. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4bsZ407VCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> The Lord Jesus came from heaven to earth and visited the earth for thirty-three and a half years. Although He visited the earth, He dwells in the Holy of Holies, and He wants to bring us there. He went to the altar, to the cross, with the intention that we, fallen sinners, might be brought back to Himself in the place where He dwells. To have this understanding is a great help to us in our experience. </p>

<p class="scripture" data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMGOaIVxO3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC">Scripture Reading: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36132" data-verses="Exodus 27:1-8">Exo. 27:1-8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36133" data-verses="Exodus 38:1-7">38:1-7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36134" data-verses="Exodus 40:6">40:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36135" data-verses="Exodus 40:29">29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36136" data-verses="Hebrews 13:10">Heb. 13:10</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbEKO9gPpHhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> In the foregoing message I pointed out that it is not easy to understand the record in Exodus concerning the altar. Certain aspects of this record are very puzzling. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36137" data-verses="Exodus 27:5">Exodus 27:5</span> speaks of “the ledge of the altar beneath.” It is difficult to decide how to translate the Hebrew word for ledge. The King James Version says compass, another version says border, and still other versions speak of a margin or rim. A ledge serves to hold something and is a protection. Some students of the Bible think that the ledge was outside the altar. According to their understanding, the ministering priests stood on the ledge which went around the altar. Those who hold to this view appeal to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36138" data-verses="Leviticus 9:22">Leviticus 9:22</span>, a verse which says that Aaron “came down from offering of the sin offering.” They also refer to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36139" data-verses="2Chronicles 30:16">2 Chronicles 30:16</span>, saying that the priests stood in “their place,” that is, on the ledge. Therefore, with these two verses as their basis, they understand the border or ledge to be outside the altar and to be a place where the ministering priests could stand. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0WQzMJox8Wf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6">X. A BRONZE GRATING OF NETWORK</h2><p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcNBTIAS6zJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> What was the ledge, and where was it located? These questions are not easily answered. I am quite sure, however, that the ledge was inside the altar. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36140" data-verses="Exodus 27:4">Verse 4</span> says, “And you shall make for it a grating, a network of bronze; and you shall make upon the net four rings of bronze upon its four ends.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36141" data-verses="Exodus 27:5">verse 5</span>, the network was to reach “unto the half of the altar.” The altar was three cubits high, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1216" id="1216">[1216]</span> five cubits long, and five cubits wide. The grating, the network of bronze, inside the altar stretched horizontally from side to side at the middle of the height of the altar. The wood was placed upon this grating, and the sacrifices were put upon the wood. As the wood and the sacrifices burned, the ashes fell through the grating to the bottom of the altar. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36142" data-verses="Exodus 27:5">verse 5</span> tells us clearly that the grating was put under the ledge of the altar beneath. The composition of this verse is rather unusual, but the Hebrew does say “under the ledge of the altar beneath.” The fact that the grating was under the ledge indicates that the ledge could not have been outside the altar. The grating was not only under the ledge; it was beneath the ledge. If the ledge had been outside, how could the grating inside the altar have been beneath the ledge? Therefore, I believe definitely that the ledge was inside the altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h_DkgIc8l6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> The altar was made with acacia wood overlaid with bronze. The fire on the altar was to burn without ceasing. Does it not seem that the heat of the fire would pass through the bronze covering and cause the acacia wood inside to become charred? To be sure, this would have been the situation. For this reason, I believe that the ledge protected the four walls of the altar from the heat of the fire on the grating. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9MmpplJQHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> The Bible does not tell us of what material the ledge was made. I believe, however, that it must have been made of bronze. Therefore, I believe that above the grating and around the four walls there was a ledge of bronze protecting the walls from the heat of the fire. This may be the reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36143" data-verses="Exodus 27:5">verse 5</span> says that the grating was not only under the ledge, but also beneath the ledge. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCt9pBwZfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> One writer has suggested that the network was actually at the bottom of the altar and reached halfway up the sides of the walls. Moreover, this writer supposes that when the altar was set up, it was placed on two heaps of dirt to allow air to reach the fire. However, such an interpretation involves too much guesswork. But if you would ask me how <span class="pg" data-page-id="1217" id="1217">[1217]</span> the air could get in, I would have to answer that I do not know, for the Scripture does not give us this detail. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLR8HkqvJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> The very fact that the altar has certain puzzling elements has a spiritual significance. The altar should actually be very easy to describe, easier to describe than the other items of furniture. But as we have pointed out, the record concerning the altar is rather puzzling. Although it is simple, it is nevertheless hard to understand. The significance of this is that it is not possible for us to understand thoroughly the mystery of the cross of Christ. Yes, in the New Testament the cross is revealed. We are told clearly that Christ was crucified, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36144" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">1 Corinthians 1</span> Paul uses the expression “the word of the cross,” telling us that the word of the cross is the power of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36145" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:18">v. 18</span>). But we are unable to apprehend the mystery of Christ’s redemption thoroughly. When I first came into the ministry fifty years ago, I tried many times to give messages on the cross. However, each time I rose up to speak, I did not have much utterance. The reason was that it is very difficult to speak about the cross of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG5huRr9fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> Are you able to speak about the cross of Christ in an adequate way? Of course, you can declare that the cross was the place where Christ was put to death. You can also say that on the cross Christ bore our sins, that we were crucified with Him, and that even the Devil was destroyed on the cross. But how about the mystery of Christ’s death? Even those who have been teaching the Scriptures for years will find it difficult to speak concerning the mystery of Christ’s all-inclusive death. Christians may place a cross on top of their places of worship, and some may even wear a cross. However, they cannot speak about the cross adequately. We can read the verses in the New Testament which refer either to the cross or to Christ’s crucifixion. Nevertheless, after reading these verses, we still are not able to apprehend the mystery of Christ’s death thoroughly. The death of Christ is a great mystery. Because it is such a mystery, we do not have a way to describe it adequately. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNE_i00PaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> Another puzzling matter is related to the grating, or the network, within the altar. The grating has four rings at its <span class="pg" data-page-id="1218" id="1218">[1218]</span> four ends. However, these rings are also for the poles used in carrying the altar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36146" data-verses="Exodus 38:5">38:5</span>). The grating is on the inside, but the rings are on the outside. How, then, could the rings be attached to the grating? We are told clearly that the rings are upon the four ends of the network, and the rings must be outside the altar. Otherwise, the poles could not be put into the rings. It is puzzling how the rings could be attached to the network and yet be outside the altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0swsMx6qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> If there were only the four walls of the altar without the grating inside the altar, the altar would be empty. The significance of the altar depends completely on the grating, the network, with the four rings. Yes, the rings are for the move of the altar, but they are connected to the grating inside the altar. Without the grating, there would be no rings, and without the rings, the altar could not move. This brings us to a very important matter: Without the grating there would be no way to have the fire used in burning the sacrifices. Thus, both for the burning of the sacrifices and for the move of the altar, the grating with the four rings is necessary. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBY-4HDaKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> We may compare the grating and the rings to the inward parts of our physical body. Our inward parts are more vital than our skin and hair. In the same principle, the grating is the important part of the altar. If the grating were removed, the altar would become an empty box, not useful for anything. The content of the altar is the grating with the rings. </p>

However, as I was considering this matter, I realized that, in principle, there must be something very important here, because the altar is a type of the cross of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDToyHys4RSr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> In the New Testament the cross is not revealed in a way which corresponds to our natural, human understanding. If the cross were presented in this way, probably one of the main writers in the New Testament—Paul, John, or Peter—would have given us a lengthy definition of the significance of Christ’s cross. From the human point of view, we sense the need for this kind of definition. But such a definition cannot be found in the New Testament. In the New Testament the revelation concerning the cross is given piecemeal; that is, various parts of the revelation, like the pieces of a puzzle, are found here and there throughout the New Testament. For example, there is something about the cross in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36158" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>, and something else in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36159" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36160" data-verses="1Peter 2:24">1 Peter 2:24</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36161" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XnIOYeKO1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> Many of the verses related to the cross are understood by Christians in a superficial way. For instance, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36162" data-verses="1Peter 2:24">1 Peter 2:24</span> says, “Who Himself carried up our sins in His body onto the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose bruise you were healed.” Preachers <span class="pg" data-page-id="1226" id="1226">[1226]</span> often quote the first part of this verse, pointing out that Christ bore our sins in His body on the tree. But they may not go on to consider the deeper matters covered in this verse. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc5vAuvN3w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> Neither in the Old Testament typology nor in the New Testament revelation is the cross described in a detailed way. There must be a reason for this lack of detail concerning the cross of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC8xXY-H7C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO">THE GRATING AND THE FOUR RINGS</h2><p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTfJAQBDXVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> A very significant point in the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36163" data-verses="Exodus 27:1">Exodus 27</span> concerning the altar is the four rings. At first I thought that there might have been two sets of rings, one inside the wall of the altar and the other outside. As we have seen, the grating is inside the wall. However, the four rings, which would have to be outside the wall, were at the four corners of the grating. Thus, it is possible to think that there were two sets of rings: the first set at the ends of the grating inside the wall, and the second set outside the wall for the two poles. This might be a possibility, if the only record concerning the altar were that found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36164" data-verses="Exodus 27:1-8">27:1-8</span>. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36165" data-verses="Exodus 38:5">38:5</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36166" data-verses="Exodus 38:7">7</span> clearly say, “And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staves....And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it withal.” In light of these verses, we cannot hold the concept that there were two sets of rings, one inside the altar and the other outside. There must have been only one set of rings. These rings were at the four ends of the grating inside the wall, but they nevertheless were outside so that the two poles could be put into them. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4EKO1K3xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> Even now, I do not know how to explain this. The Scripture does not tell us how the rings could be attached to the grating and yet still be on the outside of the altar. But as I considered this matter, the light began to shine, and then the revelation in the New Testament concerning the relationship between Christ’s redemption and the eternal Spirit began to open up. Concerning this relationship, the New Testament has some important things to say. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1227" id="1227">[1227]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9GLYCMpyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> In the four Gospels we have a picture of the grating. If we would understand the grating, we need to understand the Gospels. Do you know what is presented to us in the four Gospels? The Gospels present a redemptive grating, a grating where redemption was accomplished. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl83vqmPovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> Then in the book of Acts we have the Spirit as the four rings. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36167" data-verses="Acts 1:8">Acts 1:8</span> says, “But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.” The four rings are for reaching the four corners of the earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yK8EYe089qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> Then in the Epistles we have the definition of these four rings. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36168" data-verses="Hebrews 9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>, Christ offered Himself to God and accomplished redemption through the eternal Spirit. By means of this eternal Spirit the redemption accomplished by Christ will be brought to the ends of the earth. By this we see that almost the entire New Testament is needed to define the grating with the four rings. </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9LIyfIj6RI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> To repeat, the grating is presented in the Gospels; the connection of the four rings to the grating is seen in Acts; and in all the following Epistles we have a definition of the four rings. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36169" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span> reveals that Christ became a life-giving Spirit. In the Epistles we see the Spirit through whom Christ accomplished the all-inclusive redemption. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldVzD8-GcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ">THE RINGS DIVORCED FROM THE GRATING</h2><p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6ZPQcLyIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> Do you realize what is the situation in today’s Christianity with respect to the grating and the rings? The situation is this: the rings have been divorced from the grating. The fundamentalists have the grating without the rings; the Pentecostals have some kind of rings separate from the grating. In the Lord’s recovery the four rings are brought back to the grating. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cBxpP1Tbw2edSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> For the most part, we are opposed not because of the grating, but mainly because of our testimony concerning the rings. There has been some opposition because of our teaching concerning the grating. You know that I have given <span class="pg" data-page-id="1228" id="1228">[1228]</span> messages on Christ being made in the likeness of the flesh of sin. In these messages I pointed out that on the cross Christ was in the form of the serpent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36170" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span>). Some opposing ones, twisting my word, accused me of teaching that Christ had the nature of the fallen flesh. Such an accusation comes from their blindness. Have these opposers never considered Paul’s strong word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36171" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>? In this verse Paul says that Christ was made sin. In my messages I emphasize the fact that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36172" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Romans 8:3</span>, Christ was in the likeness of the flesh of sin. Furthermore, referring to the type of the brass serpent lifted up on a pole by Moses in the wilderness, I said that the brass serpent was in the form of an actual serpent, but that it did not have the poisonous nature of the serpent. Likewise, Christ was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not have a sinful nature. Those who oppose this truth have only a shallow understanding of Christ as our Savior and Redeemer. They have not been enlightened from the Word to see that Christ was in the likeness of the flesh of sin and even became sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUXi4OAH5gmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> As we have pointed out, most of the opposition is related to our testimony that Christ today is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. Regarding the mingling, some have gone so far as to accuse us of teaching pantheism or the deification of man. The accusations concerning Christ being the Spirit involve the Trinity, the Person of Christ, and the mingling. All these matters are related to the four rings, the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-_76zGe5Y6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> Many Christians today have an altar that lacks the proper connection between the four rings and the grating. Some have the grating without the rings, but others have the rings without the grating. Those who have the grating may have it only in a superficial way without the connection of the rings, and those who have the rings may actually have the wrong kind of rings and without the connection to the grating. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMGOqISje3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC">GOD’S REQUIREMENTS FULFILLED</h2><p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbEKONgL6nhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> We have pointed out that the grating is at half the height of the altar, halfway between the top and the bottom. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="1229" id="1229">[1229]</span> means that there were one and one-half cubits above the grating and one and one-half cubits below it. This was equal to the height of the ark of the testimony. The dimensions of the ark were two and one-half cubits in length and width and one and one-half cubits in height. Thus, the height of the ark was half the height of the altar. Therefore, the grating signifying Christ’s all-inclusive and completed redemption was placed on a level with the height of the ark. </p>

<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBY-YHEJKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36188" data-verses="Exodus 27:1-8">27:1-8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36189" data-verses="Exodus 27:1-3">verses 1 through 3</span> are on the outward appearance of the altar, but <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36190" data-verses="Exodus 27:4-8">verses 4 through 8</span> are on the inward contents of the altar. What is difficult to understand concerning the altar is not the outward appearance; it is the inward contents. The contents of the altar are the grating and the four rings, through which were placed the poles used in carrying the altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf8o_7osD2ndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> A part of the altar that is related to the inward contents is the ledge. We have pointed out that the Hebrew word may also be rendered border, margin, or rim. No one can say definitely what this ledge was. I believe that it was used to protect the four walls of the altar from heat. The Bible does not tell us how wide the ledge was. I believe that it went down to the grating, which was at half the height of the altar. There were one and one-half cubits above the grating and another one and one-half cubits below it. Thus, the grating divided the altar in half. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeSMrW65tP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> The more I study the portion in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36191" data-verses="Exodus 27:1">Exodus 27</span> concerning the altar, the more assured I am that the ledge protected the walls from the scorching heat of the fire burning on the grating. The fire burned continually for years. If there had been no protection for the walls, the acacia wood underneath the bronze would have been charred. Therefore, the ledge must have served as a protection. The grating used for <span class="pg" data-page-id="1234" id="1234">[1234]</span> holding the wood and the sacrifices was underneath the ledge. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bRNiHNMZne1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that the four rings typify the Spirit. These rings have two aspects. The first is that they were connected to the grating. This means that the rings were one with the grating. Therefore, the grating was not separate from the four rings. Rather, the rings belonged to the grating and with it formed one piece of work. Second, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36192" data-verses="Exodus 38:5">38:5</span>, these four rings were for the poles used in carrying the ark. There were two rings on each side of the altar. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeSMrWzrNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky">THE CONTENTS OF THE ALTAR</h2><p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bRNiHNELXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> I would emphasize the fact that the contents of the altar are the grating with the four rings. Some expositions of Exodus speak of the acacia wood and the bronze. These matters, however, are somewhat superficial. It is common for expositors to point out that the acacia wood signifies the humanity of the Lord Jesus, that the bronze signifies the righteous judgment of God, and that the four horns of the altar signify the power and strength of the redemption of Christ. The redeeming blood was sprinkled on these horns. Furthermore, the blood of the same sacrifice was brought into the Holy Place and sprinkled on the four horns on the incense altar, and also brought into the Holy of Holies to be sprinkled on the propitiatory cover of the ark. Since such matters are not so deep or mysterious, it is somewhat easy for expositors to understand their significance. But expositors may not have much to say concerning the grating and the four rings. In this message I am burdened to speak regarding the mysteries of the redemption of Christ as signified by the grating and the rings, which are types, or figures, of these mysteries. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJpxc---Viqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> In the human body, the skin, the flesh, and the bones are not as mysterious as the inward parts, especially the soul and the spirit. Our psychological part, the soul, is made up of the mind, the emotion, and the will. The soul, although not as deep as the spirit, is mysterious. Inside the soul and <span class="pg" data-page-id="1235" id="1235">[1235]</span> surrounded by it, we have the spirit. Thus, our psychological and spiritual parts are the true mysteries of our being. The inner content of every person is the soul and the spirit. In the same principle, the inner content of the altar is the grating with the four rings. </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRE_L6gmj2TX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> The grating depicts the mystery of Christ’s redemption. The wood and the sacrifices were placed on the grating to be burned. The grating was the place where the fire was burning. Without the grating, there could be no burning, for the burning was on the grating. Furthermore, we have seen that the grating was at half the height of the altar, reaching from side to side halfway between the top and the bottom. The fact that there were one and one-half cubits below the grating indicates that it was on the same level as the propitiation-cover on the ark in the Holy of Holies. This indicates that the grating comes up to the standard of the propitiation-cover. When Paul speaks of the redemption of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36193" data-verses="Romans 3:24-25">Romans 3:24-25</span>, he definitely says that God made the redeeming Christ our propitiation-cover. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJ1hhVRcNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> When the altar was carried, the poles were on the shoulders of a number of persons. These poles were placed in the rings. The weight of the grating with the wood and the sacrifices rested upon these four rings. This indicates that the entire redemption of Christ is upon the four rings, which are a type of the eternal Spirit. This should help us to have a clear understanding of the Spirit. Because of shallow, inadequate teaching, not many Christians realize that the redemption of Christ rests upon the power of the eternal Spirit. The wood and the sacrifices were on the grating. Thus, the grating bore the weight to accomplish the burning. This burning signifies the accomplishment of redemption. The weight of accomplishing redemption was on the grating. But what bore the weight of the grating? This weight was borne by the four rings, a type of the eternal Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9ZSZlOcEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer">REDEMPTION ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfUGXmSwPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> It is correct to say that it was not the four rings that accomplished redemption. The burning for the accomplishment of <span class="pg" data-page-id="1236" id="1236">[1236]</span> redemption took place on the grating. The grating signifies Christ, and the rings signify the Spirit. Christ, not the Spirit, was the One who accomplished redemption. We have absolutely no doubt concerning this. But where does the grating stand? Is it supported by its own strength? Apart from the four rings, the grating had no support. Both when the altar was at rest and when it was carried, the grating was upheld by the rings. There was no other support, no other upholding power. To repeat, the grating was upheld by the four rings. Yes, the burning was accomplished by the grating. But the upholding power is in the rings, not in the grating itself. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36194" data-verses="Hebrews 9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span> speaks concerning this: “How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.” It was through the eternal Spirit Christ offered Himself to God as our sin offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr8676SLe4pcJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> During the years I was with the Brethren, I was never told that Christ offered Himself by the Spirit and through the Spirit. Have you ever heard a message on Christ offering Himself to God by and through the eternal Spirit? Christians do not ordinarily speak this way, for not many have this knowledge. Because they do not have the knowledge, they do not use the language of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36195" data-verses="Hebrews 9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>. Nevertheless, such a word is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36196" data-verses="Hebrews 9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnjbsNXNmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> The all-inclusive Christ died an all-inclusive death through the eternal Spirit. He died through the Spirit who is eternal, the Spirit who is without beginning or ending. Such a mysterious event actually took place in human history, but it is neglected by unbelieving historians. No history book will ever tell you that the all-inclusive Christ offered Himself through the eternal Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH6qjasbW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> I first came to know <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36197" data-verses="Hebrews 9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span> many years ago. However, I did not understand the meaning of this verse. What does it mean to say that Christ offered Himself to God as a sin offering through the eternal Spirit? This is not easy to understand. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1237" id="1237">[1237]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzIJKNTQ_D9BVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU">WHY CHRIST OFFERED HIMSELF THROUGH<br/>THE ETERNAL SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAuZ-R6Hcj0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> What is the significance of the phrase “through the eternal Spirit”? Why was it necessary for Christ to die on the cross through the Spirit? Was Christ not almighty, and was He not able to do everything necessary to accomplish redemption? Why then did He need the eternal Spirit in order to die on the cross? My burden in this message is to present a picture concerning this matter. This picture will lead to a conclusion, and the conclusion will then become the answer to the question of why Christ offered Himself through the eternal Spirit. </p>

<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnjYcNQdGh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> Some readers of the Bible may think that the altar of the burnt offering was a table or stand on which the offerings were placed, some kind of box with the sacrifices placed on top. Actually, the altar was somewhat like a shell. It had four sides and a grating in the middle, but no top or bottom. We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36226" data-verses="Exodus 27:1">Exodus 27</span> that the altar was five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36227" data-verses="Exodus 27:4-7">Exodus 27:4-7</span> speaks of the grating, the rings, and the poles. If the grating with the four rings and the two poles which were placed in the rings were removed from the altar, the altar would be an empty shell, an empty box. Years ago, I paid attention to this “box”; yet I have no memory concerning the grating, the rings, and the poles. It seems that these three things did not impress me very much. Whenever I thought about the altar of the burnt offering, I would picture a shell, a box. The grating, the rings, and the poles, however, are the contents of the altar. Furthermore, these things are the reality, strength, and power of the altar. The power, strength, and reality of the altar depend on the contents of the altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH6pTaqLm2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> We have pointed out that the grating is located at half the height of the altar and reaches from one side to the other. The grating must have been heavy and strong. Otherwise it could not have borne the weight of the wood and the sacrifices. It must have been made with bronze and thus able to withstand the heat. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1246" id="1246">[1246]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzIJKOjQ1RdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU">THE REDEEMING CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAuZ9h6MOT0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> Let us consider the picture portrayed by this type and ask what it signifies. Within the shell of the altar there was a grating, a network, and upon this grating were the wood and the sacrifices which were burned. As the offerings and the wood burned, the ashes fell down to the ground, but the smoke ascended as a sweet savor to God for His satisfaction. Thus, the sweet savor was for God’s satisfaction, and the ashes were a proof that the offering had been accepted by God. When God smelled the sweet fragrance, He was satisfied and pleased. When the one who presented the sacrifice saw the ashes, his conscience could be at rest, for the ashes were proof that the sacrifice had been accepted by God and that the one who presented it had been forgiven. The grating was related to both the fragrance and the ashes. The fragrance was above the grating, and the ashes were below it. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldVwj8-EcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> The grating signifies more than just the redemption of Christ. According to the Bible, Christ and His redemption cannot be separated. Christ Himself is our redemption. Redemption is not merely a matter—it is also a Person. Yes, the grating does signify the redemption of Christ. However, it actually signifies the redeeming Christ. The grating is a type of Christ in His redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6ZMwcLwIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> To understand how the grating typifies the redeeming Christ, it would be helpful to compare the grating to the propitiation-cover on the ark. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36228" data-verses="Romans 3:25">Romans 3:25</span>, the propitiation-cover is Christ Himself. Propitiation is not merely an action accomplished by Christ; propitiation is Christ. The One who accomplished propitiation is Himself the propitiation-cover. The cover of the ark is a Person—Christ—in His accomplishment of propitiation. In the same principle, the grating signifies Christ, the Redeemer, in His redemption; that is, it signifies Christ Himself in His redemptive work. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cBxpMVTYwWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> We have seen that the ashes were evidence, a proof, a confirmation, that one’s sacrifice had been acceptable to God and that his sin or sins had been forgiven. As a result, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1247" id="1247">[1247]</span> God enjoyed the savor of Christ’s redemption, and the offerer enjoyed peace. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUXi7uAE5AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> It is important to see that the grating was not at the bottom of the altar or at the top. On the contrary, it was in the middle, halfway between the top and the bottom. This indicates that the judgment of God upon Christ was an inward matter and not only an outward one. Christ bore the judgment of God not only upon His shoulders; He also bore it within His heart. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36229" data-verses="Psalms 22:14">Psalm 22:14</span>, which speaks of the sufferings of Christ on the cross, says, “My heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.” This indicates that when Christ suffered the judgment of God, He suffered this judgment not only outwardly, but also inwardly. This is the significance of the grating being within the altar and in the middle of it, neither at the top nor the bottom. Christ’s suffering of God’s righteous judgment was an internal matter and not only an external one. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-_4azFfZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> We do not have the utterance adequate to speak of Christ, His cross, and His redemption. We are short of understanding, and we lack the ability to speak adequately concerning what we do understand. Therefore, we are thankful for the picture afforded by the altar of the burnt offering. This picture reveals details that are not clearly mentioned in the New Testament. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMGNKIRi-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC">AN ETERNAL DEATH</h2><p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbEKNtgI6HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> If you would read through all twenty-seven books of the New Testament and study each verse related to Christ’s redemption, the death of Christ, or the cross of Christ, you still will not have a clear view of what the death of Christ is. Christ’s death is great and all-inclusive. According to the Bible, it is not simply a temporal death—it is an eternal death. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36230" data-verses="Revelation 13:8">Revelation 13:8</span>, in the sight of God, Christ was slain from the foundation of the world. Hence, He is the eternal Redeemer, and His death, unlike that of sinful human beings, is an eternal death. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0WQwcJuisWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> We cannot understand the death of Christ in full. Certain aspects of the redeeming death of Christ simply cannot be <span class="pg" data-page-id="1248" id="1248">[1248]</span> explained. But the grating signifies the all-inclusive Christ with His eternal death. He bore the burning and the weight of the righteous judgment of God exercised upon Him. But although the picture of the altar portrays this, we still cannot understand in full all the details related to Christ’s death. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcNCDIJCazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej">THE ASHES AND THE FRAGRANCE</h2><p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h_A0gAMMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> One matter related to the altar that I do not fully understand is the ledge. Regarding the ledge and the grating, the two words “under” and “beneath” are used. I believe that the ledge with the grating beneath it formed a hearth, a place of burning. As I have pointed out previously, the ledge may have protected the acacia wood inside the bronze covering on the four sides of the altar from being scorched by the intense heat. However, I cannot say exactly what the spiritual significance of the ledge is. It may signify the support given to Christ as He bore God’s judgment on the cross. As He was bearing the burning of God’s righteous judgment, He, as a human being, certainly needed something to sustain Him. The ledge may signify the support given to the redeeming Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFgtT7xNlB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> I would ask you to consider again the picture of the altar with the grating. As the wood and the sacrifices burned on the grating, the sweet fragrance ascended to God, and the wood and the sacrifices were reduced to ashes. To repeat, ashes are a strong confirmation that we have been accepted by God and that our sins have been forgiven by Him. Therefore, we can have peace. Ashes are a sign of this. The ashes, therefore, are for us, whereas the sweet fragrance is for God. May we all be impressed with the redeeming Christ as signified by the grating and the altar of the burnt offering. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Fkuzj-q8k5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X">THE REDEEMING CHRIST ISSUING IN THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_Cka16ct5KauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> The grating issues in the four rings. The rings were not added to the grating; neither were they welded to it. According to the record, the four rings came out from the grating. I believe that the four ends of the crossbars of the grating <span class="pg" data-page-id="1249" id="1249">[1249]</span> were inserted into holes in the side. I also believe that the ends of the bars projecting out through the holes in the altar were fashioned into rings. Thus, the rings were not separate from the grating, but formed one piece with it. I do not believe that after the grating was made, four rings were fashioned and then connected to the grating. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36251" data-verses="Exodus 27:1">Exodus 27</span> we are told clearly that the grating was at half of the height of the altar. Since the altar was three cubits high, the grating was positioned one and a half cubits above the bottom of the altar. The ark of the testimony was one and a half cubits high. Therefore, the grating and the propitiation-cover of the ark were on the same level. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8ar6-AwKTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> In the messages on the ark, I pointed out that the dimensions of the ark were all in halves. The ark was two and a half cubits in length, one and a half cubits in width, and one and a half cubits in height. These dimensions are precisely half of the length and height of the altar. As we have pointed out, the altar was five cubits wide, five cubits long, and three cubits high. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5E7nHAVIFazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> We have seen that there were one and a half cubits below the grating and another one and a half cubits above the grating. The fact that there were one and a half cubits underneath the grating signifies the standard according to which the redemption of Christ was accomplished. The standard of the redemption of Christ was up to the requirement of God’s righteousness, holiness, and glory. This is signified by the bronze grating of network being at the half height of <span class="pg" data-page-id="1256" id="1256">[1256]</span> the altar and thereby on the same level as the height of the ark of the testimony with the propitiation-cover. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnjYMNXPmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> Christ died on the cross to accomplish the all-inclusive redemption for us according to the standard of the ark. The ark was the place where God could meet with man. Man is fallen. He has been distracted from God, and he has deviated from God’s way. Nevertheless, God wants to meet with fallen man. To make such a meeting possible, something had to be done according to the standard of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH6pDasZW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> If you closely examine the record of the ark in Exodus, you will see that the ark is related to God’s righteousness, holiness, and glory. The cherubim signify glory, and the law points to God’s righteousness. Furthermore, the gold overlaying the ark signifies God’s holiness. The righteousness, holiness, and glory of God all make demands on fallen man. If, as fallen sinners, we want to meet with God, we must fulfill the requirements of His standard. His standard involves His righteousness, holiness, and glory. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36252" data-verses="Romans 3:23">Romans 3:23</span> says that we all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. This indicates that God’s glory is a measuring rod and that, when measured by it, we all come short. Because we cannot reach up to the height of God’s glory, we are not qualified to meet with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzIJKOzQ8DdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> Christ died an all-inclusive death for the accomplishment of our redemption. This was according to God’s requirements, according to the height of God’s standard related to His righteousness, holiness, and glory. This is the significance of the grating being at the same level as that of the propitiation-cover on the ark. It is on this level that God can meet with us, and it is on this level that we can be brought back to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAuZ9x6EcD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> God dwells in the Holy of Holies. But one day He came out of the Holy of Holies to the outer court. This means that God came down from heaven to earth to bring man back to Himself. In order to accomplish this, God traveled from the ark to the altar, that is, to the cross. The destination of God’s journey from heaven to earth was the altar, the cross. At the altar God seemed to say, “Sinners, I want you to come <span class="pg" data-page-id="1257" id="1257">[1257]</span> back to Me. But if you want to come back to Me, something must take place so that My requirements are fulfilled. Your coming back to Me and My meeting with you must be according to the standard of My requirements.” This is the significance of the grating being on the same level as the propitiation-cover of the ark. If it were possible to draw a line from the grating in the altar to the propitiation-cover on the ark, we would see that these two were on the same level. Christ’s all-inclusive death for redemption, therefore, matches the standard of God’s requirements. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw3-QDlLLMBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw">THE EFFICACY OF CHRIST’S REDEMPTION</h2><p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZwJxR29KYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> We have pointed out that the ashes from the sacrifices that burned on the grating fell to the bottom of the altar, whereas the fragrant aroma of the sacrifices ascended to God. Thus, the one who presented the sacrifice could see the ashes and thereby have evidence, confirmation, proof, that he had been forgiven and accepted. As believers, we may have the assurance that because Christ’s redemption reaches the level of God’s requirements—the standard of His righteousness, holiness, and glory—we have been accepted by God. Now we must go on to see the significance of the height of the part of the altar above the grating being the same as the part underneath the grating. This signifies that the efficacy of Christ’s redemption is according to its standard. The fragrant aroma of the sacrifices ascended for God’s satisfaction. This refers to the efficacy of Christ’s redemption. The efficacy is according to the same standard as the accomplishment of redemption. How is it possible for God to be satisfied with Christ’s redemption? God can be satisfied because Christ’s redemption fulfills all His requirements. As a result, this redemption has an efficacy, and this efficacy is according to the same standard for God’s satisfaction. </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneDKPN7LUHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> These matters are difficult to explain, but we realize them by experiencing them in the spirit. Whenever we enjoy Christ and His redemption, we have the sense deep within that Christ’s redemption is fully according to the standard of God’s requirements. Moreover, we realize that the efficacy <span class="pg" data-page-id="1258" id="1258">[1258]</span> of Christ’s redemption is such that it satisfies God according to His requirements. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbouySSBwzAoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> You may have had this kind of experience when you were saved, although you may not have had the words to describe it. I can testify that I experienced this when I was saved more than fifty years ago. I had full peace because I realized that Christ’s death on the cross fulfilled all of God’s requirements. The requirements of God’s righteousness, holiness, and glory had been fulfilled by the redeeming death of Christ. Knowing that because of this I was no longer short of God’s requirements, I was at peace. No longer could anything condemn me or drive me away from God. I could not be blamed or cast into hell. I had the full assurance that Christ died to fulfill God’s requirements for me. What else could God require of me? I had such assurance and peace that I could even challenge God and say, “God, the death of Christ has fulfilled all of Your requirements. What else can you demand of me?” All new believers should issue such a challenge to God, knowing that Christ has fulfilled the requirements of God’s righteousness, holiness, and glory for us. If you challenge God in this way, asking what else He can demand of you, He may reply, “I have no further demands. The unique death of Christ has fulfilled all of My requirements.” </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83HsBavwSXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> Because the grating is on the same level as the propitiation-cover, God can come to converse with us. Here on the propitiation-cover we can have fellowship with Him. Hallelujah, the requirements have been fulfilled, and we do not have any shortage! </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCkdBYvSKvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> When I was saved, I had a deep realization that God was pleased and satisfied. This is the fragrant aroma ascending to Him for His pleasure and satisfaction. This is the efficacy of Christ’s redemption being according to God’s standard for His satisfaction. Praise the Lord that we have peace and that God has satisfaction! Therefore, both we and God are happy. This is the enjoyment and experience of Christ with His redemption in the four rings, the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjMzCqiyxM7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> Underneath we have the ashes, and above we have the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1259" id="1259">[1259]</span> sweet fragrance. Both the ashes and the fragrance are according to the standard of God’s requirements. Furthermore, we are not carrying the altar in an individualistic way, but in a corporate way. The church is bearing the poles in the rings to testify the redeeming Christ in the all-inclusive Spirit. </p>

Actually, this is not the case. If we try merely to understand the dimensions and materials of the court, we shall not have difficulty. But if we seek to know the spiritual significance of the court of the tabernacle, we shall find that this is not easy to understand. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC8wW4-Bpy81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO">CATEGORIES OF MATERIALS</h2><p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTfIBwBKFVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> As a help to understanding the spiritual significance of the court of the tabernacle, I would like to point out a few matters. First, we need to realize that in the building of the tabernacle, the furniture, and the outer court, there are three main categories of materials. The first category is metal, minerals. Gold, silver, and bronze are all of metal. The second category is plants. The minerals are not related to life, but plants certainly are of life. Both the acacia wood and the linen are of the plant life. The third category of materials is that derived from the animal life. Some of the materials, such as the rams’ skin and the goats’ hair, come from land animals, but the porpoise skins come from sea animals. The materials taken from animals are also related to life. As we have pointed out elsewhere, the plant life is for generation, for production and propagation, and the animal life is for redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4FLu1Clhnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> The main metals used in the tabernacle were gold, silver, and bronze. According to the sequence of the record in <span class="pg" data-page-id="1264" id="1264">[1264]</span> Exodus, gold is mentioned first, then silver, and then bronze. From the inside to the outside, the sequence is gold, silver, and bronze. But from the outside to the inside, the sequence is bronze, silver, and gold. God’s view is from the inside to the outside, but our view is from the outside to the inside. Therefore, with God the sequence is gold, silver, and bronze. But with us the sequence is bronze, silver, and gold. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcMADIJAazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> Regarding materials taken from the plant life, the record first mentions acacia wood and then linen. However, with the tabernacle and the furnishings, the acacia wood was not visible. It was overlaid by either gold or bronze. The linen, of course, was visible. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h-C0gAOMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD">RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HOLINESS</h2><p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFhvT7yNFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> If we consider the tabernacle, the furniture, and the outer court as a whole, we shall see that the entire situation indicates two important matters: righteousness and holiness. You may think that you know the meaning of righteousness and holiness in the Bible. Christians often talk about holiness, and many Christians desire to be holy. They may not talk as much about righteousness. However, in the Bible righteousness is mentioned not less than holiness. In some verses righteousness and holiness are put together. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36256" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">Ephesians 4:24</span> says that the new man was created in “righteousness and holiness of the truth.” Here we have righteousness and holiness together with truth. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36257" data-verses="Colossians 3:10">Colossians 3:10</span>, the new man is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of God. The image of God is related to righteousness and holiness. At this point, we need to ask a crucial question: How can righteousness and holiness be related to the image of God? We should not take what the Bible says concerning righteousness and holiness for granted, or assume that we understand these matters because we have been reading the Bible for years. It is very significant that the new man is being renewed according to the image of God and that this image is related to righteousness and holiness of the truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Flszj9qck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> Let us consider some verses which help us to see the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1265" id="1265">[1265]</span> significance of righteousness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36258" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:8-9">2 Corinthians 3:8 and 9</span> Paul says that the ministry of the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit and also a ministry of righteousness. The ministry of the old covenant was of death and condemnation. Death is versus the Spirit, and condemnation is versus justification. However, here Paul does not say that the new covenant ministry is a ministry of justification. He says that it is a ministry of righteousness. The new covenant ministry is a ministry of the Spirit for life and of righteousness for justification. We need to ask what it means to say that this ministry is a ministry of righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_ClY16fsZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36259" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span> Paul first says that the ministry of the old covenant was of death and then, that it was of condemnation. But in our thinking condemnation comes first and death follows. Paul, however, mentions death before condemnation. In the New Testament we have righteousness unto life, and also life issuing in righteousness. On the one hand, righteousness may come first and be followed by life; on the other hand, life may precede righteousness and issue in righteousness. Hence, regarding righteousness and life there are two sides: the side of righteousness unto life, and the side of life unto righteousness. In the same principle, in the Bible we have condemnation unto death, and death resulting in condemnation. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQe1QdszxAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> When a sinner comes to God, that sinner is condemned, and this condemnation issues in death. This is condemnation unto death. This is one side. The other side is that we may be in a condition of death, and this condition issues in condemnation. This is death unto condemnation. From one side there is condemnation unto death; on the other side, there is death unto condemnation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36260" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span> Paul is speaking from the standpoint of the second side, that is, of a condition, a state, of death resulting in condemnation. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755Tw-TLj99jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> Before we were saved, everything we were and everything we did were in death. That was our condition. The result of such a condition was condemnation. God condemns every aspect of our past. Even today, if we continue to live in the old creation, we shall be in a condition of death, a <span class="pg" data-page-id="1266" id="1266">[1266]</span> condition which is under God’s condemnation. The entire old creation is under the condemnation of God. But the new covenant ministry comes to impart the Spirit into us, that is, to regenerate us and make us living. Therefore, the Spirit who imparts life issues in righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoACuDjw6AePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> Suppose a sinner repents and believes in the Lord Jesus. Immediately he is justified. No longer is he condemned, for God’s righteousness is given to him. This is righteousness unto life. Because such a repentant sinner receives God’s righteousness and is justified, he has life. This is one side. Now that he has life, if he lives by this life, the result will be righteousness. This is the other side, the side of life unto righteousness. The new covenant ministry not only brings us to God so that we may be justified; it brings us into a state, a condition, to have a living of righteousness. This means that the ministry of the New Testament ministers the Spirit to us so that we may have a living of righteousness. The Spirit is the life supply, and righteousness is the expression of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyNnv_KGJvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> The Bible speaks often concerning the righteousness of the law. What is the righteousness of the law? In order to answer this question, we need to know what the law is. In this Life-study of Exodus we have strongly emphasized the fact that the law, the Ten Commandments, is a portrait of what God is. The Ten Commandments are of two categories. The first four commandments are of one category, and the last six commandments are of another category. The first four commandments are concerned with God: not to have any god other than God Himself, not to make images or idols, not to take the name of the Lord in vain, and to keep the Sabbath day as a sign of belonging to the Lord. These four commandments are related to God’s holy nature. Thus, the first four commandments are concerned with God’s holiness. </p>

SIGNIFYING THE SPHERE AND BOUNDARY<br/>OF GOD’S BUILDING</h2><p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUXj5-ACrQmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> The outer court signifies the sphere and boundary of God’s building. The tabernacle not only typifies Christ Himself, but also typifies God’s dwelling place on earth. God’s dwelling place is in four stages: Christ, the children of Israel, the church, and the New Jerusalem. Christ is God’s dwelling place, God’s building. In the Old Testament Israel also was God’s dwelling place. Now in the New Testament the church is the building of God, His dwelling place. In the millennium the New Jerusalem will be God’s dwelling place for eternity. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8--6KzMM5Y6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> The book entitled <em>The Vision of God’s Building</em> shows that the entire Bible is a book of building. In the first two chapters of the Bible, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36276" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span>, we have the materials for the building. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36277" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> mentions gold, bdellium (a kind of pearl), and onyx stones. In the last two chapters of the Bible, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36278" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span>, we have a building made of these three categories of material. Between these two ends of the Bible there is the process of God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMHPaIZxO3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> For the fulfillment of His plan to have an eternal building, God first created all things. Creation was a work of preparation. God’s main work is the work of building. When we read the Bible, we may pay attention to God’s creation, but not to God’s work for His building. God’s selection, predestination, calling, redemption, and salvation are all for the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1276" id="1276">[1276]</span> building. Even regeneration is for God’s building. Whatever God is doing today—in preaching the gospel, edifying the saints, or establishing churches—is part of His building work. In other words, these activities are part of God’s main work, the work of building. God has a goal, and this goal is to build a universal dwelling place for Himself. In the tabernacle in Exodus we have a type, a model, of this building. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83GuBavySXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> Although the tabernacle was rather small, ten cubits wide and thirty cubits long, it is unique in every aspect. It would be difficult to change anything related to it. No human being would make such a design. As we have pointed out, the tabernacle was according to the pattern shown to Moses on the mountain. Thus, the pattern of the tabernacle was a heavenly pattern. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCkcDYvSIvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> The tabernacle as God’s building had a sphere and a boundary. This sphere and boundary were the outer court. I prefer a house with a wall to mark the boundary of the property. Such a dwelling has a boundary with a definite sphere. We know from the book of Revelation that the New Jerusalem will have a wall one hundred forty-four cubits high. This indicates that God’s building has a boundary. God likes to have a wall to mark the boundary of His dwelling place. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjMyAqixxs7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E">II. ITS SIZE</h2><p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wJysm3K-vl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> The length of the court of the tabernacle was one hundred cubits. The number one hundred is composed of ten times ten. This signifies completion of completion. This expression can be compared to the expressions King of kings or song of songs, indicating that it is the best, the highest, of completion. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8bp6-JjqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> The width of the court was fifty cubits. Fifty is composed of ten times five and signifies complete responsibility. Ten is the number of completion, and five is the number of responsibility. Without the five fingers on our hand, it would be difficult to bear responsibility. On each hand we have four fingers plus one thumb. The number four signifies human beings as God’s creatures, and one signifies God. Man plus God gives us the ability to bear responsibility. As believers, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1277" id="1277">[1277]</span> we are human beings with God added to us. Our number is now the number five. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5F5nHIG4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> The area of the outer court formed a rectangle one hundred cubits in length and fifty cubits in width. This rectangle was half of a square with sides of a hundred cubits. This half of a square signifies one half of a whole unit. It also indicates that another half is necessary. Thus, it implies a testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fUxV28TNcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> The outer court was a testimony. One half was present and the other half was yet to come. The New Jerusalem will be a complete whole, a square and not a rectangle. We, of course, are not yet in that age of fullness. We are still in the age of testimony, waiting for the coming of the other half. We are like one half of a married couple that needs the other half for completion. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vRuT9rhE6d_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52">III. THE HANGINGS</h2><p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4btYo07WCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> The hangings of the court signify Christ as God’s righteousness to be the expression of God’s building as its boundary (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36279" data-verses="Exodus 27:9">27:9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36280" data-verses="Exodus 27:11-12">11-12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36281" data-verses="Exodus 27:14-15">14-15</span>). Christ as God’s righteousness is both the expression and the boundary of God’s building. Here we have three important words: righteousness, expression, and boundary. Christ is God’s righteousness, Christ is God’s expression, and Christ is the boundary of God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL_2Zf6DP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> The fine linen signifies God’s righteousness, and this righteousness of God is actually Christ Himself. Christ is God’s righteousness becoming righteousness to us. Christ is our righteousness, and this righteousness is the righteousness of God. This Christ, who is both God’s and ours, is the expression of God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cygizklcFAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> Whenever the tabernacle with the outer court was erected in the wilderness, the people could see white linen as the sphere of God’s building. This expression was white, bright, clean, and in order. There was no mixture, and there was nothing dirty. The tabernacle with the outer court portrayed a sphere where everything was righteousness, the righteousness of God lived out through Christ and now also <span class="pg" data-page-id="1278" id="1278">[1278]</span> lived out through His church. The church today must have a proper expression, the expression which is Christ Himself as our righteousness. The boundary of God’s building is such a righteous expression. The boundary of the church is the church’s expression of Christ to be the expression of God’s building. However, often there is a shortage of such a boundary or expression among Christians today because they are short of Christ. They are lacking in the living out of Christ to express God in righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzi3yJ-3kyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36282" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">Ephesians 4:24</span> Paul speaks of the new man. This new man is actually the building of God. When we compare <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36283" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">Ephesians 4:24</span> with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36284" data-verses="Colossians 3:10">Colossians 3:10</span>, we see that the new man will be renewed in the image of God in righteousness and holiness of the truth. The image of God has a twofold expression—righteousness and holiness. The new man is renewed in the image of God, which bears the expression of righteousness and holiness. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc5uBevO3Q9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> In the tabernacle the expression of God’s building was righteousness outwardly and holiness inwardly. In the outer court there were the hangings of linen signifying God’s righteousness. Inside the tabernacle there was gold. The boards and the furniture were overlaid with gold. The gold signifies God’s nature, which is holiness. Holiness is God’s nature, and righteousness refers to God’s deeds. Whatever God says and does is righteous. All God’s acts are righteous. Hence, righteousness is the expression of God in His doings, whereas holiness is the expression of God in His nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC8wWo-E7i81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> The church today as God’s building should have this twofold expression of God. The outward expression of the church should be righteousness, and the inward expression should be holiness. On the outside of the church, others should be able to see an expression of God in righteousness. But from inside the church everything should be golden; that is, there should be the expression of God in His holy nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTfIBgBAW1FgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> The types in the Old Testament give details concerning spiritual things that cannot be described in words. A picture is often better than words. For example, you may use <span class="pg" data-page-id="1279" id="1279">[1279]</span> thousands of words to describe a person’s face and yet still not be able to describe it adequately. It would be much better to have a picture of the face. In the same principle, the books of the New Testament may not describe in detail certain spiritual things. For the details it is helpful to consider the types. In the types we can see many points that we cannot find in the New Testament. In particular, with the tabernacle and its court, we see the expression of God in righteousness outwardly and holiness inwardly. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4FL-1J2Rnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF">A. Of Linen</h2><p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9HKoCPpSQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> The fine linen signifies the human living of Christ. Our expression of righteousness should be the expression of Christ’s human living. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl92fqlPIvIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> The linen used for the hangings was fine. It was even, not coarse or rough. If we read the four Gospels, we shall see that Christ’s human living truly was fine, even. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yL90Yd3c9qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> The linen was also twined. This signifies dealt with through sufferings. As a result, it was not loose. While Christ was living on earth, He was dealt with through sufferings. </p>

<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_ClYV6Y_5KauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> In this message we come to the gate of the court of the tabernacle. We may think that the gate is the most simple aspect of the outer court. However, when we begin to consider this matter, we find that it is not simple at all. Some of the points in this message may be quite new in concept to us all. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQe1Q9s1iwajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg">THE APPEARANCE OF THE GATE</h2><p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755Tw-zLqu9jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> The first thing I wish to do is to give you an impression related to the appearance of the gate. In studying the types in the Old Testament, we need to pay attention both to the contents and to the appearance. The types in the book of Exodus have these two aspects—the aspect of the contents and the aspect of appearance. For example, the altar of burnt offering has a certain appearance. Furthermore, the grating, the rings, and the poles are the contents of the altar. In the previous messages concerning the outer court, we saw the contents and the appearance of the outer court. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoACuDDwyTOPzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> The gate of the court of the tabernacle, like the entrance of any kind of building, has a particular appearance. The front gate or door of a building bears an appearance that attracts people’s attention. This was also true of the tabernacle. When someone approached the tabernacle from a distance, he could see the gate of the outer court. With this gate there was something representing the appearance of God’s building. The first impression one would have of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1288" id="1288">[1288]</span> tabernacle and the court was that of the gate and the hangings on the two sides of the gate. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyNnvfKGLvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> It is not difficult to remember the description of the front of the court. The front side was fifty cubits in width and had ten pillars. On each side of the gate was a hanging of linen fifteen cubits long. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36297" data-verses="Exodus 27:14-15">Exodus 27:14 and 15</span> say, “And the hangings for the one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. And for the second side shall be hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36298" data-verses="Exodus 27:16">Verse 16</span> describes the gate with its curtain: “And for the gate of the court there shall be a curtain of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of an embroiderer; their pillars four, and their sockets four.” As we consider the front of the court of the tabernacle, we should pay attention to the numbers three and four. On each side of the gate, there were three pillars and three sockets. Furthermore, on each side there were three spaces covered by a hanging of linen fifteen cubits long. The number fifteen, composed of three times five, signifies the responsibility borne by Christ matching the requirements of the Triune God. The fact that there were three pillars and three sockets on each side signifies that both the base and the standing matched the Triune God. Moreover, the two sides of the gate signify a testimony, since two is the number of testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqD6hh-hgkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> As we have seen, the gate itself was twenty cubits in length. There were four spaces for the four openings, and there were four pillars and four sockets. The number twenty here, composed of four times five, signifies Christ bearing the responsibility for men, the creatures. The four openings with the four pillars and the four sockets signify the gate being open toward men from the four ends (corners) of the earth (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36299" data-verses="Exodus 27:2">27:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36300" data-verses="Exodus 27:4">4</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDToyGzs4YAr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> The curtain itself signifies the redeeming Christ as our entrance into God’s building. The blue signifies something heavenly; the purple, something royal; the scarlet, something of redemption; the fine twined linen, something even <span class="pg" data-page-id="1289" id="1289">[1289]</span> and of a strong human life; and the work of an embroiderer, the constituting work of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XmJOYWYe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> Here we are emphasizing the numbers three and four. On each side there were three groups of three: three pillars, three sockets, and three spaces. In the gate there were four groups of four: four pillars, four sockets, four spaces, and four openings. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9MnoZlJRHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0">INTERPRETING THE PICTURE</h2><p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCs8ZBwYfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> Now I would ask you to interpret this picture. What is the significance of the front side of the tabernacle with the gate? Actually, it does not require very much skill to interpret this picture, since the spiritual alphabet is right before our eyes. Four signifies the creature, and three signifies the Triune God in resurrection. The two sides, each with the number three, signify a testimony. In the entrance we have the number four, signifying the creatures. Therefore, on each side we have the number three signifying God, and in the middle we have the number four signifying man, the creature. This means that the Triune God is borne by man, or that man bears God as a testimony. The appearance of the front side of the outer court is that of man bearing the Triune God as a testimony. This is very meaningful. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLQ93kquJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> Now we must see that this Triune God whom we bear as a testimony is involved with man. Rather, He is in man. The very Triune God whom we bear as a testimony is no longer just the number three itself, but the number three with the number four, that is, three joined to four. This indicates that we bear the Triune God in man as a testimony. No doubt, the main number here is three. The number four is subordinate. God with man, or God in man, is the One we bear as a testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG4geRr8fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> Now we must go on to see why such a picture is portrayed at the front of the gate of the tabernacle. In this regard, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36301" data-verses="John 16:8-11">John 16:8-11</span> is helpful. Speaking of the Spirit of reality, these verses say, “He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment; concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me; <span class="pg" data-page-id="1290" id="1290">[1290]</span> and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer behold Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36302" data-verses="John 16:1">Chapter sixteen</span> of John is, of course, a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36303" data-verses="John 14:1">chapters fourteen and fifteen</span> and is itself followed by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36304" data-verses="John 17:1">chapter seventeen</span>. These four chapters go together. If we have the proper knowledge of these chapters, we shall see that they depict God as a testimony. Moreover, God in these chapters is the Triune God involved with man. In this portion of the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus speaks of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. These three are one. All those who believe in Christ are to be perfected into one in the Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36305" data-verses="John 17:23">John 17:23</span>). Hence, in these chapters we see the Triune God involved with man and man bearing the Triune God as a testimony. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNF-S00MaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB">BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0txcMx5qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> If we have a deeper experience of Christ’s redemption, we shall not preach the gospel in a superficial way. Instead, we shall preach the gospel in a way that will cause the listeners to know that they need to repent and become those who bear the Triune God as a testimony, bearing the Triune God who is involved with man. In our gospel preaching we need to say, “Do you intend to repent and believe in the Lord Jesus? Will you now receive Him as your Savior? If you intend to repent, believe in the Lord, and receive Him as your Savior, you must become a person bearing the Triune God as a testimony. You must realize this is the purpose of receiving the gospel.” If a person does not repent for this purpose, then he should not try to enter the gate of the court of the tabernacle. This is a basic principle of the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBZ_IHAbqzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> There are terms, conditions, of believing in the Lord Jesus and entering into Him, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36306" data-verses="John 15:1">chapters fifteen through seventeen</span> of the Gospel of John. However, at the time of our repentance, hardly any of us knew of these terms or conditions. I certainly was not told anything about them. Because we have this shortage, we need to go back and make up certain spiritual lessons that we should have learned at <span class="pg" data-page-id="1291" id="1291">[1291]</span> the very beginning of our Christian life. For this reason, in this message I am actually preaching the basic principles of the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf8p-ropRGndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> Some may think that this understanding of the gospel is too deep for most people to understand. Actually, it is not deep at all. If it appears to be too deep, it is because of today’s shallow gospel preaching. This kind of preaching spoils our God-given talent to understand spiritual things. A new believer is able to understand much more than we realize. </p>

Outwardly, God’s expression is righteousness, signified by the linen. Inwardly, God’s expression is holiness, signified by the gold. How can we enter into the realm, the sphere, of God’s righteousness? We enter into this realm only by passing through the gate of God’s judgment, where everything related to us is judged. Then we are qualified to bear God’s righteousness as His expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNF-C09c6oTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> Furthermore, we also have the ground, the way, and the means to enter into the gold, into God’s nature, and to enjoy the divine nature as everything to us. As we have pointed out, in the Holy Place and in the Holy of Holies everything is golden. This signifies that God’s nature is everything to us. By enjoying the divine nature, we have the inward expression of God, that is, holiness as the expression of God’s nature, of God’s being. God’s outward expression is related to what He does, His doings. God’s inward expression is related to what He is, to His being. To be in the Holy of Holies is to be in God’s golden nature. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0txMM5paQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p">THE EXPERIENCE OF JUDGMENT</h2><p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4btYI07UCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> I hope that we all shall realize something vital concerning God’s judgment. Everyone who desires to come into God’s building must be judged. Apart from the gate of judgment, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1302" id="1302">[1302]</span> there is no way for us to enter into God’s building. It is through the judgment of God that we enter into His house. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL_25f6BP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36315" data-verses="John 16:8">John 16:8</span> says that the Spirit of reality “will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment.” This means that He will exercise God’s judgment on the world in a positive way, not that people may perish, but that they may be saved. True repentance is to be under God’s judgment. Whenever a person repents, he places himself under the judgment of God. Only the experience of judgment can keep our spiritual life and our church life stable. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cygiTkmclAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS">A LIFE UNDER GOD’S JUDGMENT</h2><p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzi3SJ93EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> A proper human life is a life constantly under judgment. In order to have a pleasant married life, both the husband and the wife need to live a life that is always being judged. But if a husband tries to justify himself all the time, he will have problems with his marriage. A basic cause of separation and divorce is self-justification. Whenever a husband feels that he is justified, that he is right in every way and in everything, he will automatically condemn his wife. If she is one who has such an attitude, she will condemn her husband. As a result, it will be impossible for them to stay together any longer. The husband justifies himself and condemns the wife, and the wife justifies herself and condemns the husband. This makes a pleasant married life impossible. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc5uB-vN2w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> But suppose the husband condemns himself and feels that there is nothing good in him, that not even his good intentions are acceptable to God. By the Lord’s mercy and grace, he remains under God’s judgment. Then he will say to himself, “Whether or not my wife is wrong is not my business. My concern is to remain under God’s judgment.” If both the husband and wife have this attitude, they will have a good feeling toward each other, and they will enjoy a very pleasant married life. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC8wWI-H6C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> In the church life we also need to be under God’s judgment. If we justify ourselves, we shall not be able to stay in the church life. The more I justify myself, the more I shall <span class="pg" data-page-id="1303" id="1303">[1303]</span> condemn others. Eventually, I shall leave the church. Those who justify themselves and condemn others are not able to stay with others. In the church God’s way is the way of judgment. </p>

This is true both in the church life and in married life. If a brother and his wife are willing to be under God’s judgment, spontaneously God’s righteousness will be upon them. Others who visit their home will be able to see the righteousness of God. But if the husband justifies himself and the wife justifies herself, then visitors in their home will not see anything of God’s righteousness. Instead, they will see two strong expressions of the self. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9HKICMqyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP">BRONZE, SILVER, AND LINEN</h2><p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl92_qmMovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> The elements of the gate of the court of the tabernacle are bronze, silver, and linen. The gate is constituted of these three elements. The bronze used in the sockets and the pillars is the basic material. The sockets are for the base, and the pillars are for standing. We have seen that the capitals on top of the pillars were overlaid with silver. These capitals were a crown and indicate that redemption crowns God’s judgment. God’s judgment brings forth redemption, and redemption crowns God’s judgment with glory. Furthermore, the hooks used for holding the linen to the pillars were of silver, and the connecting rods were also of silver. By means of these hooks and rods, the pillars could stand as one entity to hold the linen. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yL9UYd1c9qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> We have emphasized the fact that the linen signifies the righteousness of God. Therefore, here we have God’s judgment with the redemption of Christ as a crown to hold God’s righteousness. This is the front of God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9KJifLiaRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> When sinners outside this building hear the glad tidings and repent, they experience an inward convicting through the Spirit of reality. The Spirit of reality works on them to <span class="pg" data-page-id="1304" id="1304">[1304]</span> convict them and to cause them to condemn the self. This leads them to repent before God; they realize that, because they are fallen, they must be under God’s judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldUyT89E8JlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> With us fallen creatures, there is nothing that can be justified by God. For this reason, Paul says in Romans that no flesh shall be justified before God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36316" data-verses="Romans 3:20">Rom. 3:20</span>). Rather, the entire old creation must be judged, condemned, by God. If we submit to this divine judgment and condemnation, we shall simultaneously experience the redemption of Christ. Then we shall see that Christ died not only for our sins, but also for us. When we realize this, redemption crowns us and links us to God’s righteousness. In other words, redemption brings in the righteousness of God as our expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6YOAcIwos4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> First we are judged by God and then redeemed by Christ. Christ now hangs upon us as God’s righteousness. We bear the righteousness of God as the expression and testimony of God. Therefore, we are those judged by God and redeemed by Christ. With others, we are the church to become a testimony of God. We remain human beings, but we are human beings who have been judged, redeemed, and linked to God’s righteousness, bearing Christ as God’s expression. Now we bear the Triune God as our testimony. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cBxoOlTbx2edSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa">PREACHING AN UPLIFTED GOSPEL</h2><p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUXj5eAH4gmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> We all need to learn to preach the gospel according to what is revealed in the typology of the gate of the outer court. We must exercise our faith to preach such an uplifted gospel. We should not preach a gospel that has been lowered down to what we think is the level of people’s understanding. Instead of bringing people up to the level of the gospel, many of us have lowered the thought of the gospel when presenting the truth to unbelievers. For years, I did this when I preached the gospel. I realized that many of those in the audience were pagans. Some were Buddhists. They did not know God, they did not know anything about the gospel, and they had never heard the name of Jesus Christ. Because I considered their situation, I did not preach an <span class="pg" data-page-id="1305" id="1305">[1305]</span> uplifted gospel. Missionaries to China also had this practice. Deep within, they had the thought that the Chinese people were not able to understand such matters as redemption, justification, and regeneration. This caused them to lower the level of their gospel preaching. This is a mistake. We need to realize that within man there is a God-created talent, ability, to receive God and to receive and understand His gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8--6qzGf5Y6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> People in the educational sphere have learned that children have the ability to understand more than teachers formerly thought they could understand. Just as children are often able to understand more than their teachers realize, so unbelievers can understand more of the gospel than we realize. Whenever we preach the gospel, we must believe that those listening were created by God with a certain ability, a talent, to receive and understand the message of the gospel. We need to improve our gospel preaching. We should preach an uplifted gospel and never lower the concept. </p>

<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJ0hRVWPtP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> With the foregoing message, we finished the life-study of the tabernacle with its outer court. After completing the section on the tabernacle, we would expect to come next to the priests, especially to the garments of the priests. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36318" data-verses="Exodus 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> concludes with two verses on the lighting of the lamps on the lampstand in the tabernacle: “And you shall command the sons of Israel that they bring you olive oil, pure, beaten, for the light, to light the lamps continually. In the tent of meeting, outside the veil which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall set them in order from evening until morning before Jehovah; it shall be a statute forever for their generations by the sons of Israel.” If these two verses were not included at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36319" data-verses="Exodus 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span>, probably none of us would miss them. Years ago, I was bothered by the fact that after such a long portion concerning the tabernacle with its court, the divine record inserts these two verses related to the lighting of the lamps. Because I do not take anything in the Word for granted, I have brought this matter to the Lord and spent time with Him regarding it, seeking to find the reason for the insertion of these two verses at this very point. Why is this matter, which does not describe any aspect of the tabernacle or its furniture, included here? Why does this chapter end with a word about lighting the lamps? <span class="pg" data-page-id="1308" id="1308">[1308]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9YSplIP0fCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer">A PRIESTLY SERVICE</h2><p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfVGnmbjPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> In reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36320" data-verses="Exodus 27:1">chapters twenty-seven and twenty-eight</span> of Exodus, I have noticed that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36321" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span> also begins with the conjunction “and.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36322" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">Chapter twenty-eight</span> is concerned with the garments for the priesthood. Although these garments do not seem to have anything to do with the lighting of the lamps, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36323" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span> begins with the conjunction. This indicates that the divine record puts these two matters together. After the lengthy record concerning the tabernacle with its furniture and outer court, Moses adds a short section on lighting the lamps, and then follows with a portion on the priestly garments. We need to find the reason for this sequence, especially why Moses links together the lighting of the lamps and the priestly garments. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr8677S7ew6MJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> To understand this matter, we need to realize that there were no windows in the tabernacle. In particular, there was no sky light, no window in the roof. Therefore, it was impossible for light to get in. If there had been no light inside the tabernacle, the tabernacle would have been filled with darkness. When we are in the dark, we are not able to do anything. If we try to do something, we may cause damage or injure ourselves. Because there were no windows in the tabernacle, there was the need for the lighting of the lamps inside the tabernacle. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNF_y00OaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> The activity of lighting the lamps was holy. These lamps were not in a common or ordinary place; they were the lamps in the sanctuary, in the Holy Place. Because it was a holy task to light these lamps, the common people were not qualified to do this. They may have been good people and well-educated, but they were not holy. There was the need for holy persons to light the holy lamps in the Holy Place. Thus, for the lighting of the lamps there was the need of the priesthood. The lighting of the lamps was a priestly service. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0tw8Mx7qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> The priestly service involved three main items. The first was to offer the sacrifices at the altar in the outer court. All the sacrifices had to be offered to God by a priest. A person coming to offer something to God was not able to do this <span class="pg" data-page-id="1309" id="1309">[1309]</span> himself. He had to offer his sacrifice through a priest. Thus, the priestly service first included the offering of the sacrifices. This aspect of the priestly service was rather rough or coarse, for it involved the sacrifice of large animals. The altar was a place of slaughter, and it was the duty of the priests to slaughter the animals and offer them to God as sacrifices. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBZ-oHDbKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> The second and third items of the priestly service were the lighting of the lamps and the burning of the incense. These matters were fine and delicate. As we have seen, the lighting of the lamps could not be done by common people but could be done only by holy ones, by priests. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf8p_LoqRmndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> According to the Bible, spiritually speaking, a priest is one who has been fully possessed by God. In the New Testament sense, a priest is not only possessed by God in full, but is entirely filled and saturated with God. The priests in the Old Testament were types, shadows, of the real priests in the New Testament. Today we who believe in Christ are true priests. As priests, we should be possessed by God, filled with God, and saturated with God. Furthermore, a priest is a person who is absolutely for God. His life and living are wholly for God. He lives and has his being for God. He does not care for anything on earth except God. Hence, a priest is a person possessed by God, saturated with God, and living for God. He has no other interest. In every respect and in every way, his unique interest is God. Because a priest is filled and saturated with God, he is a man of God. The lighting of the lamps in the Holy Place requires the service of this kind of person. For this reason, we emphasize the fact that the lighting of the lamps was a priestly service, a service of the priests. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeTMbWzqNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky">LIGHT FROM THE LAMPSTAND</h2><p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bRMi3NEKXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> The light in the Holy Place was a particular light. It was not a natural light, that is, a light that comes from the sun during the day or from the moon and the stars at night. Neither was the light in the Holy Place a man-made light. Neither a natural light or a man-made light, it was a light <span class="pg" data-page-id="1310" id="1310">[1310]</span> that came from the golden lampstand. In other words, it is a light that comes from the divine nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJpwcO--Uiqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> In the messages on the golden lampstand we pointed out that the lampstand is made purely of beaten gold. No substance or material other than gold is used. The light comes out of the gold. This indicates that the light in the Holy Place comes purely out of the divine nature of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRE-LKgmi2TX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> The lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God. With the gold we have the nature of the Father, the divine nature; with the form, the shape, of the lampstand, we have the Son; and with the lamps of the lampstand, we have the expression of the Spirit. Therefore, the lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God, and the light in the Holy Place issues from the Triune God. With this golden lampstand, there is no mixture. With the exception of the wick, everything is golden. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJ0hRVRfNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> The light of the lampstand comes from the burning of the wick. In ancient times the wick was made of materials from plants. The wick signifies Christ’s humanity. Yes, Christ is divine, golden. But it is His humanity, signified by the wick, that burns with oil. If the wick had not been saturated with oil, it would give off smoke instead of light. This is the reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36324" data-verses="Exodus 27:20">27:20</span> speaks of bringing “olive oil, pure, beaten, for the light, to light the lamps continually.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9YSplOfEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer">OLIVE OIL</h2><p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfVGnmRxvPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> We need to dwell on this matter of the olive oil used in lighting the lamps. Christ, as signified by the lampstand all of gold, is the embodiment of the Triune God. But in the center of the lamps there were the wicks. These wicks were not of gold; on the contrary, they were of the plant life. Because gold does not burn, it cannot give light. It is the wicks that burn to give light. However, in themselves it is very difficult for the wicks to give off light. Instead of giving off light, they give off smoke. This is the reason it is necessary to saturate the wicks with oil in order to have light. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr8677S7e7o8JK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> In typology oil signifies the Spirit of God. Oil comes from <span class="pg" data-page-id="1311" id="1311">[1311]</span> olive trees, and the olive tree signifies Christ. In the sight of God, Christ is the real olive tree. </p>

The various denominations and Christian groups all meet in their particular way. For example, the Presbyterian way of meeting is different from the Baptist way. What is your way to meet? The proper way of meeting is related to the Old Testament type of lighting the lamps in the Holy Place. We should never think that lighting these lamps is an insignificant thing. In typology, the lighting of the lamps at least implies the proper way to meet. </p>

The tabernacle was not only God’s dwelling place; it also was a place of meeting. Hence, it was a place both for God’s dwelling and for the meeting of the children of Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCkcCYvaafwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> The lighting of the lamps is related to the meeting of God’s people. If we are asked in what way we meet in the church life, we should reply that we meet in the way of lighting the lamps. To meet properly as Christians is to light the lamps. Whenever we come together for the church meetings, we need to light the lamps. Furthermore, everything we do in the meetings should cause the lamps to shine. All the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1318" id="1318">[1318]</span> singing of hymns and the giving of testimonies must be the lighting of the lamps. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9HLoCMoyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP">THE NEED FOR SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE</h2><p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl93fqmOovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> Meeting together to light the lamps in the sanctuary comprises every aspect of our spiritual experience in the Christian life. It includes our experience of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, our experience of the divine nature, our experience of the uplifted humanity of Jesus that burns to give light before God and before His testimony, our experience of the Spirit of God as the oil pressed out of the fruit of the olive tree, and our experience of Christ in His process with the steps of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Furthermore, it includes our wearing the priestly garments, that is, our expression of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yL80Ye189qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> As we have pointed out, in order to be qualified to light the lamps in the Holy Place, we must have every aspect of the priestly garments. If we have the priestly robe but not the ephod or the breastplate, we are not qualified, for we are lacking in the expression of Christ. Due to such a lack, certain ones who attend the meetings are not able to light the lamps. </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9KICfIi6RI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> Do you know what it means to light the lamps in the sanctuary? To light the lamps is to give off light. When some dear ones open their mouths to speak in the meeting, we all have the sense that the light is ascending and that the darkness is vanishing. Those who shine forth light in this way are surely those with the priestly garments, the expression of Christ. How much light there will be in the sanctuary depends on the extent to which we are qualified to light the lamps by wearing Christ as the priestly garments. In order to light the lamps, we must express Christ, and we must have the experience of the embodiment of God, the divine nature, the humanity of Jesus, and the Spirit of Christ with the elements of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. All these elements need to be the ingredients of our Christian life. If this is the case, then we are qualified to light the lamps in the sanctuary of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1319" id="1319">[1319]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldUzz8-FcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ">PURE OLIVE OIL</h2><p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6YPgcLxIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> When we come to the meetings to light the lamps, we may be short of the real experience of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. We may also be lacking in the experience of the divine nature and the humanity of Christ. Furthermore, we may not have the oil of the Spirit of Christ. Instead, we may try to light the lamps with something other than olive oil. Sometimes in the pray-reading of certain saints and in their calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, there is no olive oil. They do not have the oil which comes from Christ as the olive tree, but they have oil from some inferior source. Should someone pray-read or call on the Lord in a light way, he certainly is not lighting the lamps with pure olive oil. When some saints hear this word, they may be disappointed and say, “Now I feel condemned for the way I pray-read, call on the Lord’s name, and shout praises to the Lord. From now on I’ll be silent in the meetings. I don’t want to use oil that is not olive oil.” There is no need for us to be discouraged, but there is the need for us to be purified. Young brothers, you must admit that sometimes when you shout, “Praise the Lord!” there is no olive oil in your shouting. We need to praise the Lord in a proper way, with the pure olive oil of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cBxoPFTYxWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> I do not agree with pray-reading, calling, or shouting that brings in some impure, natural element. The pure and holy pray-reading, calling on the Lord’s name, and praising should not be mixed with lightness or joking. Whenever there is such a mixture, there is darkness instead of light. Whatever we utter in the meetings must be with the pure oil of the olive tree. This is the only oil that will burn to give light in the Holy Place. Pray-reading, calling, or shouting in a natural way never causes the holy light to ascend, and it never enlightens the other saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUXj4-AE4AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> We need the cross to work in us. The pure olive oil is oil that has passed through incarnation and crucifixion and has entered into resurrection. In this oil there is no mixture, no natural element. Certainly we need to be released in the meetings and also full of joy. Sometimes we may even laugh. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1320" id="1320">[1320]</span> But our release, enjoyment, and laughter must always be with pure olive oil. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8--7KzFcZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> Whenever we come together to meet as the church, that meeting is in God’s dwelling place. It is very important to remember this. Our gathering is a sanctuary. Therefore, we should not behave as if we were in a stadium. We need to remember that we are in a holy gathering of the saints. As those whose gathering is the sanctuary of God, we need to light the lamps in the sanctuary, that is, in the tent of meeting. Of course, the physical building in which we meet is not the sanctuary, or the Holy Place; it is the gathering which is the sanctuary. No matter where we may meet, in a building or in the open air, our gathering is the Holy Place. For this reason, we should not meet in a natural way or in a secular way. Everything we do in the meeting—our speaking, singing, praising, calling, shouting, pray-reading—must cause the holy light to ascend. This is to light the lamps in God’s sanctuary so that the light may swallow up the darkness. </p>

We need to know what concept is beneath the surface. In particular, we need to know the underlying thought connecting <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36342" data-verses="Exodus 27:1-2">Exodus 27 and 28</span>. Why does the divine record speak of the priesthood immediately after the description of the tabernacle? It is rather difficult to find the reason. I have never read a book which tells us why, after the record concerning the tabernacle ending in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36343" data-verses="Exodus 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span>, we have a long section concerning the priesthood. Therefore, we need to find out why, in the sequence of the record in Exodus, the priesthood follows the tabernacle. </p>

These verses give us the reason that these two sections of Exodus are put together. Here is the reason: we cannot have the tabernacle without the priesthood, and neither can we have the priesthood without the tabernacle. The last two verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36345" data-verses="Exodus 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> indicate that immediately after the tabernacle came into existence, there was the need of the priesthood for the lighting of the lamps. This indicates that, spiritually speaking, the priesthood and the tabernacle are one entity. In the typology of these chapters, God reveals that His redeemed people are both the tabernacle and the priesthood. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1326" id="1326">[1326]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzi2CJ1lUyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> The tabernacle is a dwelling place. But how can such a dwelling place be a living people? With the fulfillment of these types in the New Testament, the tabernacle and the priesthood are put together. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36346" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">First Peter 2:5</span> says that we are built up into a spiritual house, a holy priesthood. In this verse, according to the grammar, the spiritual house and the holy priesthood are in apposition. This means that these terms refer to the same thing. Therefore, the spiritual house is the holy priesthood. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJ0hxVRdNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> In English the word priesthood refers to two things. First, it denotes a body of priests, a group of priests who work and serve together. Second, the word priesthood denotes the priestly service, the work or ministry done by the priests. Many readers of the Bible emphasize the second meaning of this word. Whenever you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36347" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span> in the past, what did you understand by the word priesthood used in this verse? The Greek language has two different words to denote the priesthood as a body of priests and the priesthood as a priestly service. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9YSJlOdEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36348" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span> the priesthood is not the service of the priests; rather, it is a group of priests who live, serve, and work together. The priesthood here is not a service; it is a body of priests built together to live and serve as one entity. This priesthood is the spiritual house. Hence, the body of priests is also a house. In like manner, the saints who are built together are a spiritual house. This spiritual house is a collective people. My point here is that the house and the priesthood are one entity. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfVGHmSxPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> The church today is first the house of God. We the believers are being built together into a spiritual house.

On the contrary, we are a house full of life. Although I appreciate the meeting hall in Anaheim very much, it cannot be compared to God’s spiritual house on one point: it is not living. The meeting hall is <span class="pg" data-page-id="1327" id="1327">[1327]</span> lifeless. The acoustics are excellent, and the stairways are very adequate. But in this building there is no life. As God’s spiritual house, the church certainly is not lifeless. However, for generations Christians have not realized that the church must be something living. Some even speak of a material building such as a chapel or cathedral as a church. The church is not a lifeless entity. Rather, the church is a constitution of Christ with His redeemed people. This means that the church is living. Therefore, we should never refer to a material building as a church. A chapel, a cathedral, or a meeting hall is not a church. We all must be delivered from tradition and never speak of the meeting place as the church. The church is a house built with life, filled with life, and constituted of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH7qzasYW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> If the church as the house of God were not constituted of life and built with life, how could it be the priesthood?

If the materials are simply piled up on the building site, it would be impossible to have a house. We would only have a heap of materials. These materials may be arranged in a very nice way to show forth their excellence. Nevertheless, there would not be a house. A house <span class="pg" data-page-id="1328" id="1328">[1328]</span> comes into existence only when the materials are built together. </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneDLM97IVnXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> Suppose when we were building the meeting hall in Anaheim, we did nothing more than pile up all the materials. We may have appreciated the beauty of certain materials, but we would not have a meeting hall, a building in which to meet.

<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbouyTRxwwBIUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> The principle is the same with the priesthood. Since the priesthood equals the house, and the house depends on the building up of the materials, the priesthood also requires the building up of the saints. When I was with the Brethren, I heard a number of messages on the priesthood. The Brethren strongly oppose the clergy-laity system and declare that all believers are priests, that they are neither the clergy nor the laity. The Brethren put a strong emphasis on what is called the universal priesthood. According to this concept, the priesthood is universal because every believer is a priest. But although Brethren teachers emphasize this matter, I never heard a message saying that all the priests need to be built up together in order to have the priesthood, the body of serving priests. Some of their teachers emphasize <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36349" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36350" data-verses="1Peter 2:9">9</span>. I heard several messages on these verses, and I was helped by these messages. However, there was no emphasis on the fact that the priesthood is a building. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83GvxasyyXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> We know that the priesthood requires the building up of the believers because the priesthood is a spiritual house.

God created man with a spirit to receive Him as life. According to the second chapter of Genesis, the divine life is presented to man in the form of the tree of life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36358" data-verses="Genesis 2:9">Verse 9</span> speaks of “the tree of life also in the midst of the garden.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36359" data-verses="Genesis 2:10">Verse 10</span> goes on to say, “And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.” From the place where the tree of life was, a river flowed to reach the four ends of the earth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36360" data-verses="Genesis 2:11-12">Verses 11 and 12</span> speak of gold, bdellium, and onyx stone. As <em>The Vision of God’s Building</em> makes clear, these matters are related to the crucial points of life and building. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36361" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we have the tree of life and the materials for God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldUzT83W8JlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> It is very interesting to compare this record with that of the last two chapters of Revelation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36362" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span> we also have the tree of life and the river of water of life. But by the time we come to the end of the Bible, the building materials are in the building, the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem will contain the same three materials mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36363" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>: gold, pearl (bdellium), and precious stones. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6YPAcDi4s4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> If the Lord grants us the time to complete the life-study of the first five books of the Bible, the Pentateuch, we shall see that these books are books of building. Furthermore, the historical books, all the books from Joshua through Ezra, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1334" id="1334">[1334]</span> Nehemiah, and Esther, are concerned with the building. In fact, the main subject of these books of history is God’s building. When everything was right with God’s building, the situation of the children of Israel was very good. But when the building was damaged, the condition of the children of Israel was also very poor. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8--7qzFeZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> In the books of the prophets the building is also a major subject. The book of Ezekiel contains many chapters that record a vision of the building. Actually, the book of Ezekiel is a book on God’s building. We have much to say regarding this in the book entitled <em>The Visions of Ezekiel.</em> Because the building is what God desires, the entire Old Testament is on the subject of God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMHO6IRj-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> There is no doubt that the Bible has much to say concerning salvation. Salvation, however, is not the ultimate consummation of the Bible. The ultimate consummation of the Bible is God’s building, the New Jerusalem.

To be sure, there is an abundance of gold in the tabernacle. We have seen that on the breastplate and the shoulder plates of the ephod worn by the high priest there were precious stones. But instead of pearl, with the tabernacle there is silver. Silver signifies redemption. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36365" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> there is pearl, but there is no silver, because at that time sin had not come in. Furthermore, in the New Jerusalem there will likewise be pearl instead of silver, for by then there will be no further need of redemption. But in between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36366" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36367" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span>, there definitely is the need of redemption signified by silver. For this reason, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36368" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:12">1 Corinthians 3:12</span> Paul mentions gold, silver, and precious stones; he does not speak of pearl. The reason Paul includes silver and not pearl is that in this present age we need redemption. Moreover, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1335" id="1335">[1335]</span> with the building of the temple in the Old Testament, the same precious materials were used. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcMBzIJBazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> Paul received a marvelous revelation from the Lord concerning God’s building. His mentioning of gold, silver, and precious stone in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36369" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span> exactly fits in with the thought that in the beginning in Genesis there was no sin and thus no need of silver. But after sin came in, there was the need of redemption. In eternity, however, there will no longer be the need for silver, for there will no longer be any sin. But during the time after the fall and before the New Jerusalem in eternity, we must have silver. Once again we see how consistent the Bible is. What Paul wrote concerning the building is consistent with the full revelation of the Scriptures. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h-DEgAPMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> True spirituality is a matter of the building. Without the building, the spiritual house, there is no sanctification, spirituality, or spiritual power. A certain brother may seem to be kind, holy, and spiritual. But if this brother is not built into God’s building, his apparent spiritual wealth will become spiritual bankruptcy. The reason for such a condition is that without the building there is no protection or covering. </p>

Suppose all the materials used in building the meeting hall were still lying on the ground. Then in case of a storm or heavy rain, the materials would be damaged. They would not have any protection. But since the materials are now part of the building, they are protected from the weather. The principle is the same with God’s spiritual building. If we want to be protected, we need to be built into God’s building. Our protection is not our spirituality; our protection is the building. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_ClZF6fvZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> In my early years as a Christian, I did not see the crucial importance of the building. By the Lord’s mercy, I have loved the Lord from the time I was saved. For more than fifty years, my love for Him has never ceased. Furthermore, I <span class="pg" data-page-id="1336" id="1336">[1336]</span> have spent much time to seek Him. I have also pursued holiness, spirituality, and power. I read a number of books on these subjects. However, my pursuit of holiness, spirituality, and power resulted in failure. Eventually I learned that the only way to be holy, spiritual, or powerful is to be built into God’s building. </p>

But no matter how much you may exercise yourself to solve the problems of opinion and peculiarity, if you are not built up, none of those messages will be of any help to you. Only as we are built up together can the matters of opinion and peculiarity be dealt with. As long as you are willing to be built into God’s building and actually are built in, the problems of opinion and peculiarity will disappear. Do not try to overcome these things by your own effort. Our unique need is to be built in. </p>

In his first Epistle, a short book of only five chapters, he speaks clearly of the building. He tells us that we need to be nourished in order to be built up into a spiritual house. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36370" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">1 Peter 2:2</span> he says, “As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36371" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">verse 5</span> he goes on to say, “You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.” According to these verses, the nourishment is for the building, the spiritual house, and the spiritual house is for the holy priesthood. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36372" data-verses="1Peter 2:9">verse 9</span> Peter speaks of a royal priesthood: “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.” When we are nourished and are built up as a spiritual house, a holy and royal priesthood, we shall show forth the excellencies, the virtues, of the One who has called us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1337" id="1337">[1337]</span> </p>

Today those who serve in the armed forces must wear an appropriate uniform. In the same principle, as a group of serving ones, the priests in the Old Testament had to wear garments that were specially designed for the priests. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36383" data-verses="Exodus 28:4">Exodus 28:4</span> indicates that these garments included six main items: “And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a tunic of woven work, a turban, and a girdle; and they shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, and for his sons, to serve as priests to Me.” </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFhtT77fFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> The breastplate was built with twelve precious stones set in gold. The ephod was underneath the breastplate. The Hebrew word for ephod means to bind. The ephod worn by the priest was similar to a vest. To the ephod were attached the shoulder plates and the breastplate. The robe was a long garment that went from the shoulders down to the feet, covering the body of the priest in full. God required that the priests be fully covered, that no part of their body would be naked. It is rather difficult to say what the tunic was. It was shorter than the robe, probably reaching no farther than the knee. Hence, the tunic may be compared to a short coat. In addition to these four items, there were the turban and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1342" id="1342">[1342]</span> girdle. The turban was a covering for the head, and the girdle was used for the girding of the loins. </p>

My concern in this message is that we have a general understanding of the significance of the priestly garments. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZwIxB29LYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> The priestly garments signify that those who serve God as priests must have a certain kind of expression. The priestly garments can be compared to the uniform worn by a policeman. When we see a man dressed in the uniform of a policeman, we know that this person is a policeman. A policeman’s uniform is his expression. The same is true of the garments worn by a judge in a courtroom. A policeman’s uniform and a judge’s robe illustrate the fact that clothing signifies expression. According to the New Testament, the priestly garments signify the expression of Christ. Every aspect of the priestly garments signifies an attribute or virtue of Christ. Therefore, the priestly garments are the serving ones’ expression of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneDLPd7LVHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM">Qualifying the Priests to Serve</h2><p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbouyTSRwzBoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> The priestly garments as the expression of the priests were their qualification. If the priests had worn some other kind of garments, they would not have been qualified to serve as priests. Once again we may use a policeman’s uniform as an illustration. A policeman is required to wear the proper uniform when he is on duty. It is the uniform which qualifies him to serve. If a policeman wore some other kind of clothing, even very fine, expensive clothing, he would not be qualified. To be qualified he must wear a police uniform. In the same principle, the expression of Christ qualifies us to serve as priests. We may claim to be priests, but do we have the expression of Christ to qualify us to serve as priests? Whether or not we are qualified to be a priest is determined by the expression of Christ. This expression is our qualification. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1343" id="1343">[1343]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83GsRavzSXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS">Sanctifying the Priests</h2><p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCkcBIvSJvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> The priestly garments also sanctify the priests. These garments separated them from all the other people. The same is true of a policeman in uniform. A police officer’s uniform separates him from others. Should a man wearing a policeman’s uniform approach you and speak to you, you would surely respect him. However, if someone without the proper uniform tried to act as if he were a policeman, you would not show him the same respect. That person would not have the qualification signified by the uniform, and he would not be separated by this uniform from others. For this reason, he would be regarded as no different from anyone else. In like manner, the priests were sanctified, separated to God, by their garments. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36384" data-verses="Exodus 28:3">Exodus 28:3</span> says, “They shall make Aaron’s garments to sanctify him to serve as priest to Me.” In this verse sanctify means to separate to God for His unique purpose. The priests were sanctified by the expression of Christ. If we express Christ, this expression will both qualify us and sanctify us. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjMyC6ixws7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36385" data-verses="Exodus 28:2">Verses 2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36386" data-verses="Exodus 28:4">4</span> of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36387" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">Exodus 28</span> speak of “holy garments.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36388" data-verses="Exodus 28:3">Verse 3</span> says that Aaron’s garments sanctified him to serve as a priest to God. The words “holy” and “sanctify” indicate that a priest of God should be separated to Him, set aside for His purpose. To be separated and set aside in this way is to be holy, sanctified. </p>

<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5F73HIF4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36389" data-verses="Exodus 28:2">Exodus 28:2</span> says, “And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for glory and for beauty.” The words “glory” and “beauty” are very inclusive. The phrase “for glory” means to express Christ’s divinity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36390" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36391" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">Heb. 1:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36392" data-verses="John 17:22">John 17:22</span>). The phrase “for beauty” means to express Christ’s humanity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36393" data-verses="Luke 24:19">Luke 24:19</span>). Glory here refers to Christ’s divinity. In our expression of Christ there must be something of the divine nature. This divine nature is typified by the gold which was part of the priestly garments. The fact <span class="pg" data-page-id="1344" id="1344">[1344]</span> that the element of gold was part of the garments typifies that divinity, the divine nature, is part of the expression of Christ. A priest must express Christ’s divinity. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fUzF2_StcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> If we read the four Gospels carefully, we shall see that although Jesus of Nazareth lived a human life, in His humanity there was the expression of the glory of God. This means that in His human living there was divinity, typified by the gold in the priestly garments. The Lord Jesus certainly expressed the glory of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36394" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> says, “We beheld His glory, glory as of an only begotten from a father.” The disciples beheld the glory of Jesus, the glory of God’s only begotten Son. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36395" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span> says that Christ is the effulgence of God’s glory. This means that He expresses God with the divine attributes. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vRuRtriFad_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52">The Beauty of Christ’s Humanity</h2><p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4bta404UiuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> The priestly garments were for beauty as well as glory. Beauty in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36396" data-verses="Exodus 28:2">28:2</span> refers to the expression of Christ’s humanity. Christ’s divinity is for glory, and His humanity is for beauty. The four Gospels reveal that in the life and daily living of the Lord Jesus we can see the divine glory and also the human beauty. With the Lord divinity and humanity are blended in a very positive way. They are woven together like fabric woven to make a particular type of textile. With the Lord Jesus the divine glory has been woven into human beauty. For this reason, with Him we behold both the divine glory and the beauty of His human virtues. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL_0Jf5Bv8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36397" data-verses="1Peter 2:9">First Peter 2:9</span> says, “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.” The Greek word rendered “praises” in the King James Version is better rendered attributes, excellencies, or virtues. This includes Christ’s divine glory and human beauty. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36398" data-verses="1Peter 2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span> the virtues, or excellencies, are the divine glory, the divine attributes, and the human beauty, the human virtues. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cyggjkldFAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> If we live Christ and Christ lives out of us, Christ will be expressed. If we have such an expression, others will realize <span class="pg" data-page-id="1345" id="1345">[1345]</span> that in our living there is something glorious. At the same time, they will sense that in our daily living there is a beautiful expression of human virtues. In the expression of Christ both the divine glory and the human beauty can be seen. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzi1iJ-2kyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> For thirty-three and a half years, the Lord Jesus expressed the divine glory with the human beauty. He bore this expression every hour, in fact every minute, of His life on earth. The divine glory and the human beauty were never absent from Him even for a moment. </p>

At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36402" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">Exodus 28</span>, the high priest was Aaron, and the priests were the sons of Aaron. In typology Aaron as the high priest signifies Christ as our true High Priest before God, and the sons of Aaron, the priests, are types of the believers. Therefore, the garments were for two classes of priests. Certain garments were only for the high priest. The other priests were not allowed to wear them. Most of the priestly garments, however, were both for the priests, the sons of Aaron, and for the high priest, Aaron. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XmL-YQKO1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-">THE BREASTPLATE AND THE EPHOD</h2><p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9MnqplACnJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36403" data-verses="Exodus 28:4">Exodus 28:4</span> says, “And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a tunic of woven work, a turban, and a girdle; and they shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, and for his sons, to serve as priests to Me.” The first two items, the breastplate and the ephod, were worn only by the high priest. Actually the breastplate may be considered part of the ephod. Three pieces were attached to the ephod: the breastplate and the two shoulder plates. These plates were connected, fastened, girded, to the ephod. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCs-pB4LvVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> Instead of translating the Hebrew word for ephod, most versions of the Bible simply give an English transliteration. This means that ephod is a Hebrew word, not an English translation. The reason this Hebrew word is brought into <span class="pg" data-page-id="1348" id="1348">[1348]</span> the English translations of the Bible is that there is no word in our vocabulary to describe this item of the priestly garments. There is nothing in our culture that corresponds to it. If there is not such a thing in our culture, then there cannot be a word to describe it. For example, if automobiles did not exist, we would not have in our vocabulary the word automobile. The word automobile came into use to describe vehicles with which we are familiar. But in our culture there is nothing exactly like the garment denoted by the Hebrew word ephod. For this reason, we are not able to translate this Hebrew word into English. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_Clal6ftZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> If you were to ask me to explain what the ephod is, I would answer that I cannot describe it with a single word or even with a few sentences. Nevertheless, in this message I shall try to impress you with the matter of the ephod, a matter that was not known in man’s culture before the priesthood was set up by God. When the priestly garments were revealed to Moses by God, the ephod was something absolutely new. This matter was completely unknown before Moses received the revelation from God. God spoke to Moses concerning the ephod, and that was the time Moses first learned of it. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQe1SNszwAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> According to the dictionaries, the word ephod means to bind, fasten, gird, or link. Hence, the ephod was a part of the priestly garments used for fastening, girding, linking, or binding. The ephod was not a jacket and not exactly a vest. Rather, it was a part of the priestly garments used for fastening or binding. The ephod, therefore, was used for fastening, girding, binding, or connecting. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755Tw8DLj89jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv">FOR GLORY AND BEAUTY</h2><p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoACuBzw6BePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> There are three main reasons for wearing clothes. In other words, the garments we wear serve three purposes. Before the fall, man did not wear any clothes. But after the fall, Adam and Eve realized they were naked, and they made something to cover their nakedness. Then God provided coats of skins to cover them. Thus, the first reason for wearing clothing is to cover our nakedness. People who are moral <span class="pg" data-page-id="1349" id="1349">[1349]</span> will want to cover themselves properly. They will not want to expose their nakedness. Immorality, on the contrary, encourages nakedness. It is both a sin and a shame to be naked. The priests in the Old Testament were fully covered from head to toe. The first purpose of clothing, therefore, is to cover our nakedness. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyNntvKGKvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> The second reason for wearing clothing is related to our health. By wearing the proper garments we are protected from the cold, the wind, and the rain. We are also protected from excessive heat. Some of us are very sensitive to the temperature and need to wear the right clothing to keep us from being too warm or too cold. If we do not wear suitable clothing in every situation, our health will be affected. Thus, clothing also serves the purpose of preserving our health. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqD6jR-hhkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> Third, people wear clothes to beautify themselves. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36404" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">Exodus 28</span>, the priestly garments were for glory and for beauty. The purpose of these garments was not mainly to cover nakedness or to protect the body from the cold. Rather, these garments were for glory and for beauty. The ephod, in particular, was not used to cover the high priest’s nakedness or to protect him from cold; it was altogether for glory and beauty. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDToyGxc4YBr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> It is significant that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36405" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">Exodus 28</span> mentions glory first and beauty second. This indicates that we should first consider glory and then beauty. When we choose our clothes, we should not consider beauty first. Our first consideration should be glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XmL-YWZe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> We have pointed out that glory here refers to the divine expression, the divine attributes, and that beauty refers to the human virtues. In our dressing we must first take care of God’s glory. For example, a sister should ask if a certain garment can be worn for God’s glory. If the sisters consider their clothing from this point of view, the style of clothes they wear may be somewhat different. However, most people today care only for their beauty; they do not care at all for God’s glory. But the ephod was first for the divine glory and then for human beauty. This piece of clothing used for <span class="pg" data-page-id="1350" id="1350">[1350]</span> fastening was composed of the divine glory and the human beauty. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9MnqplJSHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0">FASTENED TO CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCs-pBwbfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> Only the high priest had the right to wear the ephod. This typifies that we the believers do not have the right to put on what is signified by the ephod. Only Christ wears the ephod. This means that only He has the fastening power and the girding strength. Christ holds us, binds us, and fastens us to Himself. We may say that Christ links us to Himself. The holding power is His divine glory and human beauty. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLQ_HkpvpfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> We need to remember that the ephod was a piece of clothing used for fastening. Three plates were fastened to the ephod—the two shoulder plates and the breastplate. Because these plates were fastened to the ephod, they were also fastened, bound, girded, to the high priest. Having been fastened to him, they could not fall away from him. This is the significance of the ephod. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG4iuRo9_iyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> As the High Priest, Christ has the fastening power, the tying strength, and the binding ability. We do not have this power, strength, or ability. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNF8i03O6oTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> Sometimes Christians speak of the way the Lord holds us, embraces us, and keeps us. When I was young, I thought that the Lord Jesus held us as a shepherd holds a lamb in his arms. I pictured the Lord as One embracing us and carrying us in this way. But if we consider the picture of the ephod, we shall see that the Lord does not merely hold us; He binds us and fastens us to Himself, just as the plates are joined to the ephod. To hold is not as significant as to fasten, and to embrace is not as significant as to gird or bind. We are fastened to Christ; we are bound to Him. Yes, Christ bears us and carries us. However, He does not carry us like a shepherd carrying a lamb in his arms. Instead, He carries us like the high priest wearing the ephod to which the shoulder plates and the breastplate were securely fastened. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0tzsMy7KQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> Christ has fastened all of God’s people to Himself. This fastening is through His divine glory and human beauty. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1351" id="1351">[1351]</span> This means that His divine glory and human beauty are the strength to fasten us to Himself. </p>

<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJpzdO-3Hiqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> Adam was made from the dust of the ground. After God created Adam, He placed him in front of the tree of life, from which flowed a river. By the flow of this river there were onyx stones. As Adam stood by the river, he may have looked at himself and then at the onyx stones. Adam was altogether a composition of dust, not of onyx stone. Onyx stone signifies transformation. In our natural life we all are dust. But through regeneration we have become a stone. Now we are in the process of being transformed into the image of the Lord from glory to glory. This transformation is signified by onyx stone. </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRE9KKguxmTX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36422" data-verses="Exodus 28:12">Exodus 28:12</span> says, “And you shall put the two stones upon the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, as stones of memorial for the sons of Israel; and Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah upon his two shoulders for a memorial.” On his shoulders what the high priest bore was not two piles of dust. On the contrary, there were onyx stones on his shoulders. This indicates that what Christ as our High Priest holds is not dust; He holds the transformed saints, typified <span class="pg" data-page-id="1358" id="1358">[1358]</span> by the onyx stones on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod worn by the high priest. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8Ypq-JiqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> When some saints hear this, they may feel discouraged, thinking that they have not been transformed. They may say, “If Christ holds only onyx stones, and not dust, then I am through with the experience of being held by Him. I feel discouraged because I have not yet been transformed into onyx stone.” Actually you do have the experience of being held by Christ. Furthermore, you do have some amount of onyx stone. Often you may feel as if you are falling away from the Lord. But it is the dust that is falling, not you. Sometimes the Lord raises up an environment which causes us to be shaken. We may be afraid of falling away. However, only the dust is shaken away. We ourselves as regenerated ones will never be removed, for the onyx stone in us will never fall. The onyx stone remains, placed in the beautiful and glorious settings of gold. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5G53HIH4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP">FASTENED AND TRANSFORMED</h2><p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fXxF28SNcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> I admit that I am short of utterance to describe the fastening power of the divine glory and human beauty of Christ. If I had more experience and more utterance, I would try to give more illustrations. But because I am short of adequate experience, it is difficult to describe the holding power of Christ portrayed by the ephod. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vRtTtrhF6d_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> The ephod with the breastplate and the shoulderplates portrays the fastening power of Christ through His divine glory and human beauty. As we have pointed out, when we read the four Gospels, we can see the Lord with His divine glory woven into His human beauty. We can also see His heavenliness, His kingliness, and His redemption. In other words, every aspect of Christ typified by the materials and colors of the ephod is revealed in the Gospels. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4buY407VCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> As we behold the Lord in His glory and beauty, we are spontaneously held, fastened, to Him. To be fastened is to be transformed. The more we are transformed, the more we are fastened. The dust is falling away, and the transformed part of our being remains fastened to Christ and upon Him. As a <span class="pg" data-page-id="1359" id="1359">[1359]</span> result, we enjoy Him and experience Him with His fastening power. We are held not only upon Christ’s shoulders, but we are also held upon His breast. This means that we are fastened by His love and also by His power. The shoulders signify power and the breast signifies love. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL82Jf6AP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8">A MEMORIAL BEFORE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cyjijkmdlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36423" data-verses="Exodus 28:12">28:12</span>, Aaron was to bear the names of the children of Israel before the Lord upon his shoulders for a memorial. A memorial is a matter of joy. When Christ bears us on His shoulders before God, this brings joy to God. When God looks at Christ, He sees His redeemed people, who have been transformed into onyx stones held in settings of gold. Eventually the onyx stones become a beauty added to Christ. This is both a memorial before God and also an additional beauty to Christ. As we look at this picture, we see glory and beauty. This portrait is beyond the ability of human words to explain. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzh3iJ92EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA">THE BREASTPLATE</h2><p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc5tBOvN1w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> The ephod was probably a garment that had one opening for the head and two for the arms. It also served for girding the high priest. The focal point of the ephod was the breastplate. This is the reason that among all the items of the priestly garments, the breastplate is mentioned first (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36424" data-verses="Exodus 28:4">v. 4</span>). This indicates that the priestly garments were for the breastplate. In other words, the high priest wore the various garments in order to bear the breastplate. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC8zW4-H5C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> As we shall see in forthcoming messages, the breastplate signifies the building together of God’s redeemed people upon Christ. Twelve precious stones were upon the breastplate. These stones, signifying all the redeemed people of God, were built together on the breastplate. Therefore, the breastplate is a miniature of the building up of God’s people. This means that the breastplate signifies the building. As we shall see, this breastplate was used to express God’s will for His people. Before the time of the prophets, God made <span class="pg" data-page-id="1360" id="1360">[1360]</span> His will known through the breastplate. It was the instrument and the channel through which God spoke. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTfLBwBAX1FgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O">MUTUAL BEAUTY</h2><p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4GLu1J3Rnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> We have pointed out that the shoulder-pieces are Christ’s additional beauty. The ephod was beautiful in itself, but the onyx stones fastened to the shoulders of the ephod added even more beauty to it. Likewise, the transformed believers added to Christ are His additional beauty. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9EK4CPoSQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> The onyx stones were set in plaited gold, in gold filigree. Such a setting added beauty to the onyx stones. This golden filigree setting signifies Christ’s divine nature. The way the setting was made signifies the fine work of the Holy Spirit with the divine nature. The words plaited and filigree indicate that the setting was the result of skilled workmanship. That mounting added beauty to the precious stones, just as a proper mounting on a ring adds beauty to a diamond. On the one hand, the diamond is the beauty of the ring; on the other hand, the fine plaited setting adds beauty to the diamond. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl-2PqlOIvIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> The onyx stones set in gold filigree portray the fine work of the Holy Spirit to add the beauty of Christ to the believers as the precious stones. But eventually these stones will be a beauty added to Christ. Therefore, Christ is our beauty, and we become His beauty. This mutual beauty is a memorial before God. Christ and His members are fastened together, and this becomes a memorial before God. When God beholds Christ with His members, God is happy, pleased, and satisfied. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yI9kYd0c9qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS">A PICTURE OF MINGLING</h2><p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9JJSfLjaRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> As we consider the picture of the ephod with the breastplate and the onyx stones in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36425" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">Exodus 28</span>, we see how Christ and His members are fastened together by His divine glory and human beauty. Furthermore, with the ephod we also have a picture of mingling. The gold, the blue, the purple, and the scarlet are woven into the fine linen. This means that they are mingled with the linen. This mingling, however, does not change the nature of the materials involved. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1361" id="1361">[1361]</span> The gold is still gold, and the linen remains linen. But by the mingling of the gold and the linen, we have a piece of clothing composed of these two materials. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldXyj89F8JlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> I believe that the blue, the purple, and the scarlet were all threads of different colors. We have seen that the blue symbolizes heavenliness, the purple signifies royalty or kingliness, and the scarlet signifies redemption. I believe that these three colors of thread were all of linen fiber. Thus, although they were different in color, they were all made of linen. This indicates that the basic materials of the ephod were gold and linen. The gold here signifies Christ’s divinity, and the linen signifies His humanity. The weaving together of the gold and the linen into one piece of cloth signifies the mingling of divinity and humanity. This mingling then becomes the fastening strength and the binding power to hold us to Christ. </p>

This is a book filled with the experiential riches of Christ. Some of the points concerning Christ portrayed in Exodus are beyond our ability to utter. Neither in English nor in my mother tongue do I have the adequate utterance to express what I have seen concerning Christ in this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAub_x6COT0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> In the New Testament we have plain words concerning Christ, our experience of Christ, and the church. There is even a clear word concerning the preciousness of Christ and concerning our value in the sight of God. However, in the New Testament we do not have the full details regarding these matters. Many of the details are found in the types in the Old Testament. By the Lord’s grace, in this message I shall try to point out some of the wonderful details of the preciousness of Christ and of the preciousness of the saints in the sight of God. These details cannot be seen in the New Testament; however, they are found in the picture in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36431" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">Exodus 28</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw3-SBlLCfhsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw">THE MATERIALS OF THE EPHOD AND ITS COLORS</h2><p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZwLzR21ZoJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> The main part of the priestly garments was the robe, a long robe reaching almost to the ground. Over this robe the high priest wore a tunic and over the tunic, an ephod. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36432" data-verses="Exodus 28:6">Exodus 28:6</span> says, “And they shall make the ephod of gold, blue and purple, scarlet, and fine-twined linen, the work of a skillful workman.” By reading this verse we learn with what <span class="pg" data-page-id="1364" id="1364">[1364]</span> materials the ephod was made and what colors it had. The materials used in making the ephod were gold and linen. Gold is a mineral, and linen is a substance that comes from the plant life. The blue, the purple, and the scarlet indicate colors, not materials. However, we may say that the gold and the linen also have color. Gold, of course, is golden, and linen is white. Therefore, the ephod was a garment made of two materials and it contained five colors. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9MkoplJQHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> I do not believe that in the thousands of years of human history there has ever been another fabric composed of golden and linen thread woven together. Have you ever heard of a garment made of golden and linen textiles woven together? As far as the material is concerned, the ephod certainly was an unusual garment. Today some garments are made of dacron and cotton, and others, of wool and polyester. But where is there a garment made of linen and gold? We certainly would think it strange if someone today wore a jacket made of gold and linen containing the colors gold, white, blue, purple, and scarlet. I am certain none of us has ever seen a garment like this. Nevertheless, this is a description of the ephod worn by the high priest. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCv8pBwZfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> The ephod was made of linen thread and golden thread and with five colors: golden yellow, pure white, blue, purple, and scarlet. However, there was no black or gray in the ephod. Because it was made in such a fashion, the ephod was extraordinary in appearance. If you could have seen it, what color would you have said it was? Gold? Blue? Purple or scarlet? Since it was a mixture of several colors, it is very difficult to describe its color in a single word. Anyone who looked at the ephod carefully would have seen five different colors. However, he would not have a word to describe the overall color of this garment. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLT9HkqvJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ">A MINGLING OF DIVINITY AND HUMANITY</h2><p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG7guRr9fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> We know from the New Testament that the Lord Jesus is a Person with two natures: divinity and humanity. Christ’s divinity is typified by the gold in the ephod, and His humanity is typified by the linen. The gold and the linen in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1365" id="1365">[1365]</span> ephod were not linked together or joined together. On the contrary, they were woven together. This weaving together of the gold and the linen in the ephod typifies the mingling of divinity and humanity in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNG-i00PaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> Because we use the word mingling in relation to the divine nature and human nature of Christ, we have been condemned as heretical. Some are still falsely claiming that we teach that in Christ the two natures of divinity and humanity were mingled together to produce a third nature, a nature which is neither fully divine nor fully human. I have never said that the mingling of divinity and humanity in Christ produces such a third nature. The gold fibers and the linen thread used to make the ephod were not woven together to produce a third nature, something which was neither gold nor linen. No, neither the gold nor the linen lost its own particular nature when it was used to make the ephod. The gold remained gold, a mineral, and the linen remained linen, a substance derived from plants. The natures of these two materials remained, even though they were woven together, mingled together. The same is true of Christ’s divinity and humanity. The divinity and humanity of Christ have not been mingled to produce a third nature. Furthermore, in Christ neither divinity nor humanity has lost its own nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0uxsMx6qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36433" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36434" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, “The Word became flesh.” We may say that the Word, which is God, is golden, and that the flesh in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36435" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> is linen. Thus, when God became incarnate, the gold and the linen, divinity and humanity, were woven together, mingled. </p>

In theology there is a special term signifying the study of Christ’s Person. This term is Christology. Just as theology is the study of God, so Christology is the study of <span class="pg" data-page-id="1366" id="1366">[1366]</span> Christ. Throughout the centuries, there has been debate concerning Christ’s Person. Most teachers have recognized that Christ has two natures, the divine nature and the human nature. However, there have been a number of erroneous teachings concerning the two natures of Christ. Much of the debate has arisen out of this point. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeQNLWzpNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> Our book entitled <em>Concerning the Person of Christ</em> gives seven different schools of thought regarding the Person of Christ. Of these seven schools, six are heretical and one is scriptural. I would encourage you to read that book. The six heretical schools are the erroneous teaching of the Docetists, those who claimed that Christ has only divinity, but not humanity; the heresy of the Ebionites, who teach that Christ has only humanity, but not divinity; the erroneous teaching of the Arians, who say that Christ’s divinity is not complete and that He was merely the highest among the creatures; the absurd teaching of the Apollinarians, who said that Christ’s humanity was not complete; the false doctrine of the Nestorians, who maintained that Christ’s divinity and humanity were separated; and the wrong teaching of the Eutychians, who denied the distinctness and coexistence of Christ’s divinity and humanity and asserted that these two natures were merged into one. The proper, scriptural teaching is that Christ has both divinity and humanity and that His divinity and humanity are complete and united in the body of one Person. We repudiate the six heretical schools and follow the scriptural school. </p>

This would be quite likely, since they were put on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod. I believe that these two onyx stones were flat and either oblong or rectangular in shape. Each of them had to be large enough for six of the names of the children of Israel to be engraved on it. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5G5XHOVIFazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> The shoulder-pieces were located at the place where the front and the back parts of the ephod came together, where they were joined at the shoulder. This part of the ephod must have been thicker and stronger than any other part. Furthermore, because the shoulder-pieces were of one piece with the ephod, they should not be regarded as separate from the ephod itself. These pieces were one with the ephod as a whole and, joining the two parts together, they were strong enough to bear the onyx stones. In order for the ephod to bear such heavy stones, it was necessary for the shoulder-pieces to be thick and strong. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1374" id="1374">[1374]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fXxl21ANcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> We have seen that the ephod typifies Christ with His two natures, divinity and humanity. The two natures of Christ are mingled to bear the expression of God, signified by the gold, and the expression of man, signified by the linen. Christ also bears the expression of His heavenliness, kingship, and redemption typified respectively by the blue, the purple, and the scarlet. It is such an expression that becomes the material that bears the onyx stone. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vRtTNrpXqd_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52">ONYX STONES SIGNIFYING THE BELIEVERS</h2><p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc5tBuvN3w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> What is signified by the two onyx stones borne upon the shoulders of the high priest? These onyx stones signify the believers, including us. When some hear this, they may say, “Perhaps you as an older brother in the Lord are signified by the onyx stone. But I certainly am not. I have been saved for only a short time. I do not have the appearance of an onyx stone. On the contrary, I have the appearance of clay or dust.” Perhaps this is your situation. Nevertheless, as long as you have been regenerated, there is at least a small amount of onyx stone within you. If you did not have the element of onyx stone in your being, you would have no interest in hearing this kind of message. The very fact that you love the Lord and are seeking Him and that you want to hear this kind of word is a strong indication that there is at least some onyx stone in you. Eventually, all the clay will be transformed into onyx stone. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC8zWY-H7C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> With our natural being there are two aspects: the aspect of God’s creation and the aspect of the fall. Part of our natural being is the creation of God. Another part is of man’s fall. That which has its source in the fall of man will be shaken away, and that which comes from God’s creation will remain with us and be transformed. Therefore, God’s work on us accomplishes two things. On the one hand, it is shaking away, removing, the fallen aspect; on the other hand, it is uplifting and transforming the aspect of our being that is related to God’s creation to become precious stone. Of course, it takes time for the fallen element to be removed and the created element to be transformed and uplifted. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1375" id="1375">[1375]</span> Nevertheless, many of those who have been in the church life for a number of years have experienced the shaking off of the fallen element and the transformation of the created element. The result is that these saints are much weightier in Christ today than they were several years ago. Some of the fallen element has been removed, and quite an amount of God’s created element has been uplifted and transformed into precious stones. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTfLBQBDXVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> We should not doubt the fact that we are signified by the onyx stones on the shoulders of the ephod. One day, we shall be fully transformed into onyx stone. I have the full expectation both for myself and for all the saints that eventually we shall be onyx stones in a pure and complete way. In the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth, all the believers in Christ will be precious stones. </p>

It is related to how the onyx stones were placed on the shoulder-pieces. How were the onyx stones attached to the shoulder-pieces? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36455" data-verses="Exodus 28:11">Exodus 28:11</span> says, “With the work of a stone engraver, like the engravings of a signet, you shall engrave the two stones according to the names of the sons of Israel; you shall make them enclosed in settings of gold.” We have seen that the Hebrew words rendered “settings of gold” also mean plaited work of gold, plaited settings of gold, filigree settings of gold. The gold into which the onyx stones were put was not simple in shape. Rather, it was plaited into a very beautiful design. We should not think of these settings merely as sockets of gold formed to hold the precious stones. No, the gold was plaited into a filigree setting. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl-2vqmPovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> These filigree settings of gold signify how we are attached, fastened, held, to the Lord Jesus. These settings portray the Lord’s divinity after it has been processed and has passed through many sufferings. The sufferings experienced by the Lord Jesus caused Him to be formed into a beautiful setting to hold us as the precious stones. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1376" id="1376">[1376]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yI9EYe089qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> If we did not have the picture afforded by the type of the ephod with the filigree settings, we would not know simply by the plain words in the New Testament how we are held to the Lord Jesus. The New Testament indicates that we are held by the power of the Lord. The Bible says this, and we believe it. But have you ever imagined that the Lord Jesus is holding us in beautiful settings of gold filigree? We are being held to Him in a very beautiful way. </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9JJyfIj6RI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> We need to take time to pray-read these verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36456" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">Exodus 28</span> and fellowship with others concerning them. This will help us to appreciate the Lord more. The more we behold the Lord’s beauty and appreciate it, the more steadily shall we be fastened to Him and by Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldXyD8-GcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ">CHAINS OF GOLD</h2><p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6bOQcLyIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> We have seen that the onyx stones were placed into beautiful settings of gold filigree. Now we must go on to see how these lovely settings were connected to the shoulder-pieces of the ephod. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36457" data-verses="Exodus 28:13-14">Exodus 28:13 and 14</span> say, “And you shall make settings of gold, and two chains of pure gold, twined you shall make them, a work of cords; and you shall put the chains of cords upon the settings.” These verses indicate that the settings are joined to the shoulder-pieces by chains of gold. The chains of golden cords were formed of golden threads twined together. These cords of gold fastened the onyx stones in the golden settings to the shoulder-pieces. Here we have three items: the shoulder-pieces, the onyx stones in the golden setting, and the golden cords used to fasten together the settings and the shoulder-pieces. This portrays the Lord’s divinity becoming a golden fastening cord. Once again, it was necessary for Christ in His divinity to pass through a process in order to become such a golden cord. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cBxrO1Tbw2edSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> From reading the New Testament we cannot see the beauty, the filigree, of the Lord’s fastening strength and power. But we can see it by considering the picture of the ephod with the shoulder-pieces, settings, and golden cords in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36458" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">Exodus 28</span>. When the onyx stones were fastened to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1377" id="1377">[1377]</span> shoulder-pieces, they formed what we may call the shoulder plates. We have pointed out that the shoulder-pieces were part of the ephod and therefore were made of the same materials. </p>

It shall be squared and doubled; a span its length, and a span its width.” Have you ever thought that the breastplate here is a very fine, even the finest, revelation concerning the church? The ephod refers to Christ, and the breastplate refers to the church. This means that the ephod with the breastplate gives us a picture of Christ with the church, a picture that is very fine. Here I do not speak of Christ and the church, but of Christ with the church, for we do not have the ephod and the breastplate, but the ephod with the breastplate. If we speak in a general way, we may speak of the ephod and the breastplate. Actually what we have here is not two equal items. Rather, one item, the ephod, is basic, and the other item, the breastplate, is subordinate. As the subordinate item, the breastplate belongs to the ephod. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4GLe1Mlhnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> We have pointed out that the ephod depicts, portrays, Christ. Upon Christ, as depicted by the ephod, there is a breastplate, the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9EKICF6SQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP">THE CENTRAL ITEM OF THE PRIESTLY GARMENTS</h2><p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl-2_qucYvIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36465" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">Exodus 28</span>, the central item of the priestly garments is the breastplate, not the ephod. Of course, this central item belongs to the ephod. In the description of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1382" id="1382">[1382]</span> priestly garments, the first thing mentioned is the breastplate. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeQNrWzrNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> We have seen that the priestly garments were for glory and for beauty and not merely for the purpose of covering one’s nakedness or for preserving one’s health. Now we need to see that these priestly garments are basically for the breastplate. Why did God want the priests to wear certain garments? In particular, why was it necessary for the high priest to wear certain garments? The purpose of the various priestly garments was to have the breastplate. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bRPjHNELXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2">THE LORD’S LEADING</h2><p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJpzd---Viqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> What was the function of the breastplate? According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36466" data-verses="Exodus 28:15">verse 15</span>, the breastplate was called the breastplate of judgment. We know that the word judgment is related to judging. Furthermore, judgment is often concerned with the difference between right and wrong. However, the judgment here is not mainly to determine what is right or wrong, what is just or unjust. Instead, this judgment is so that God’s people could know His leading. Hence, the breastplate of judgment is actually the breastplate of leading. Why, then, does <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36467" data-verses="Exodus 28:15">verse 15</span> use the word judgment with respect to the breastplate? The answer is that if we would know God’s leading, we must have a great deal of judgment. We must judge whatever is of the flesh, the self, the old man, and the world. We must judge the things of the flesh and the mind set on the flesh. This judgment clears the way for us to know God’s leading. </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRE9K6gmj2TX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> In a forthcoming message we shall see that the breastplate of judgment actually functioned as a heavenly typewriter. If you use a typewriter when you compose a letter, you will press the typewriter keys in order to impress certain letters on the paper. With the different letters of the typewriter you are able to compose any word you need. The breastplate functions as a heavenly, divine, and spiritual typewriter. Of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, eighteen were contained in the names of the twelve tribes inscribed in the stones set on the breastplate. The remaining four letters were contained in the Thummim attached to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1383" id="1383">[1383]</span> breastplate. Therefore, with the breastplate there were all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. This made it possible for the breastplate to function as a divine typewriter. As we shall see, the Lord’s leading could be obtained through the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim much like a word, or a sentence, is composed one letter at a time by using a typewriter. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJ3ghVRcNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> We shall see that the function of the breastplate depended on the transparency of the stones shining with light. However, if some of the twelve stones on the breastplate were opaque or the letters inscribed on them were not clear, the breastplate could not function properly. Whenever that happened, there was a need to cleanse away whatever caused the opaqueness. Thus, first there was a need for judgment and cleansing. Then it could be possible to obtain a decision concerning God’s leading in a positive way. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9bTZlOcEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> Strictly speaking, the priestly garments were not merely for covering nakedness, for health, or for glory and beauty. The main purpose of these garments was for the Lord’s leading. After the tabernacle was built up and after the priestly garments were made, the children of Israel journeyed in the wilderness according to God’s leading. After the death of Moses, the high priest obtained this leading through the breastplate. He would put on the priestly garments with the breastplate and go into the tabernacle. In this way, the children of Israel could act according to God’s leading made known through the breastplate. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfWHXmSwPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> Much of the talk among Christians today concerning the Lord’s leading is very inaccurate, even nonsensical. Many speak about the leading without having any idea what they are talking about. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36468" data-verses="Romans 8:14">Romans 8:14</span> Paul says that as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36469" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> we find the reality of the breastplate. Have you ever thought that the breastplate can be seen in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36470" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>? </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr8674TLe4pcJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> In typology the breastplate was related to the Lord’s leading. Immediately some may say: “You are not being consistent. First you said that the breastplate typifies the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1384" id="1384">[1384]</span> church. Now you are saying that the breastplate is a matter of God’s leading. What does the church have to do with the leading?” I would reply that if we do not know the church, we do not know what the Lord’s leading is. Actually God’s leading and the church are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnhasNXNmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> I doubt that during the past fifty years any other Christians have spoken as much concerning the church as we have. I have even received a bad name for talking about the church. But even though we have given so many messages on the church and have published a number of books regarding the church, in this message we have something new to say about the church. We shall cover an aspect of the church typified by the breastplate. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH4rjasbW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> Not only is the breastplate the first item of the priestly garments; it is also the central item of all these garments. First the high priest wore a long robe to cover his entire body. Then over the robe he wore a tunic. This tunic was perhaps the length of a coat that reached to the knee. Upon the tunic the high priest wore the ephod. As we have indicated, we can easily understand what the robe and the tunic are, but the ephod is unique. There is nothing like it in our culture, and thus we have no word to describe it. For this reason, translators of the Bible have found it difficult to translate the Hebrew word for ephod. Therefore, they actually transliterate it. This means that ephod is an anglicized form of a Hebrew word. The ephod was over the tunic, and the tunic was over the robe. In foregoing messages we pointed out that with the ephod there were two shoulder plates, onyx stones, on which were engraved the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel. Finally, the high priest wore the breastplate comprising twelve precious stones, each of which was engraved with one of the names of the twelve tribes. We have seen that the breastplate of judgment functioned as a heavenly, divine, and spiritual typewriter to make known God’s leading. This heavenly typewriter is the very center of the priestly garments. </p>

These twelve stones do not signify God’s redeemed people in a separate or individualistic way, but in a corporate way. The stones are separate pieces, but they are not divided. On the contrary, they are incorporated, put together. Using a New Testament term, the stones have been built together. The twelve stones have been built together to become one entity, and the name of that entity is the breastplate. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0WSzcJmx8Wf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> The Lord bears us in a corporate way, even in an incorporated way. The Lord Jesus has built us together; He has incorporated us into one entity. The breastplate was one entity composed of twelve separate, individual stones. This indicates that the believers are distinct individuals, but they are not divided. We are separate pieces, but we are not <span class="pg" data-page-id="1390" id="1390">[1390]</span> separated, individualistic pieces. However, today’s Christians have been separated and divided. According to their understanding, the Lord bears each one individualistically. If this is the situation, then the Lord’s bearing of one believer does not have anything to do with His bearing of another believer. But the Lord does not bear us individualistically. On the contrary, He bears one entity, the church, which is His Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldXzj8-EcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> If we have received light from the Lord, we shall mourn over the situation among Christians today. We shall grieve over the divisions among God’s people. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6bPwcLwIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> To be sure, there were twelve tribes of the children of Israel. Each tribe was represented by a stone on the breastplate. But all these stones were built together into one entity. Therefore, the breastplate was actually a building of precious stones set in gold. The gold was the element which enabled the twelve stones to become one building. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cBxrPVTYwWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa">SIGNIFYING TRANSFORMATION</h2><p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUXg4uAE5AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> The twelve stones on the breastplate were precious stones. These precious stones signify transformation of the human nature by and with the divine nature. How do we know that they signify transformation? We know it by the fact that they were precious stones. Precious stones are not something originally created by God. On the contrary, they are formed into precious stones by a process of transformation. Through this process clay or some other material is transformed into precious stones. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-97azFfZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> An illustration of the process of transformation can be found in the way wood is changed into petrified wood. Over a period of time, water saturates the wood, carrying away its natural element and replacing it with another kind of element. Eventually, the wood is transformed into stone. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMEOKIRi-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> Christian living involves a daily process of transformation. The Bible says that man was created from the dust of the ground: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and <span class="pg" data-page-id="1391" id="1391">[1391]</span> man became a living soul” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36480" data-verses="Genesis 2:7">Gen. 2:7</span>). One day the heavenly flow with the divine mineral entered into our being. This divine mineral is the divine nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36481" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Pet. 1:4</span>), and the water is the divine life, the divine Spirit. Once this living water came into us, it began to wash away our natural life and to add more of the divine element into our being. This is transformation. Day by day we are living a life of transformation. We are all undergoing God’s transforming work. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbEIOtgI6HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> In the Lord’s recovery we have paid a great deal of attention to the matter of transformation. However, not much has been written by others on the importance of transformation. Nevertheless, it is a fact that all believers eventually will be transformed. If the process of transformation cannot be completed in this age, God will have a way to complete it in the next age. In the New Jerusalem all the believers will be transformed precious stones. Babel was built with bricks, but there will be no bricks in the New Jerusalem. This city will be built with transformed material; that is, it will be constituted of God’s redeemed, transformed people. What Christians, then, will share in the millennium? It will be those who have been transformed during their lifetime. But in eternity in the New Jerusalem all the people of God will be there as transformed ones. The Christian life is a life of transformation. Daily God is seeking to transform us. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0WSzcJuisWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> This transformation is a transformation of the human nature by and with the divine nature. This means that a better material is being wrought into us. As a result, although we were made of dust, we are being transformed into something precious and transparent. This comes from being saturated with better materials, with heavenly materials. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcPBDIJCazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> I can testify that I still need more transformation. I know that I am certainly not perfect and that the process of transformation has not yet been completed. However, I can testify that I am very different from what I was many years ago. When I was a young Christian, I was a man of clay. But over the years I have experienced much of the Spirit’s transformation. Therefore, I can testify truly that I <span class="pg" data-page-id="1392" id="1392">[1392]</span> am more transformed today than I was years ago. Many believers can give such a testimony, for we all are living a life of transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h9D0gAMMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> The twelve stones were set in golden mountings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36482" data-verses="Exodus 28:17">vv. 17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36483" data-verses="Exodus 28:20">20</span>). This signifies that the believers are kept in Christ’s divine nature. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFiuT7xNlB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s">FOUR ROWS OF STONES</h2><p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Fmtzj-q8k5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> The twelve stones were arranged in four rows. Once again, the number four used here signifies the creatures. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_CmZ16ct5KauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36484" data-verses="Exodus 28:17-20">Exodus 28:17-20</span> says, “And you shall mount it in mountings of stone, four rows of stone: a row of sardius, topaz, and emerald, the first row; and the second row, a carbuncle, sapphire, and diamond; and the third row, a jacinth, agate, and amethyst; and the fourth row, a chrysolite, and onyx, and jasper.” From this we see that there were three stones in each of the four rows. We may ask why the twelve stones were arranged in this way, since there were many other ways in which they could have been arranged, many other patterns and shapes. God’s way, however, is the most simple way, a way seemingly without artistic beauty, but a way full of spiritual significance. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQe2RdswwgajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> The four rows of stones with three stones in each row signify the Triune God in resurrection. The number four signifies creatures, and three signifies not only the Triune God, but the Triune God in resurrection. In order to be in resurrection, the Triune God had to be processed. Today the God we enjoy is the Triune God processed to be in resurrection. Now this Triune God is the all-inclusive Spirit dwelling in our spirit as the superior mineral, working in us to saturate our whole being so that we may be transformed. In this way our human, natural being is transformed with divine minerals. This is the significance of twelve precious stones arranged in four groups with three stones in each row. This is not my interpretation. This is the way God planned it, and it fits in with the full revelation of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755Tz_TLg9djlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> On the breastplate there were a total of twelve stones. Here the number twelve is composed of three times four. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="1393" id="1393">[1393]</span> twelve stones signify the mingling of God with man for the completion of God’s eternal purpose and the administration of God’s government. In the book of Revelation the number seven is often used, especially in the early chapters. We read of seven lampstands, seven stars, seven churches, seven Spirits, seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls. But at the end of Revelation, in the description of the New Jerusalem, the number twelve is used: twelve gates, twelve angels, twelve foundations, twelve Apostles of the Lamb, twelve pearls, twelve fruits. The number seven signifies the Triune God (three) added to His creature, man (four). This is merely a matter of joining, of addition; it is not a matter of mingling, of multiplication. Twelve, however, composed of three times four, signifies mingling, multiplication. </p>

<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755Tz_DLku9jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> We have seen that on the ephod worn upon the robe of the high priest there were two shoulder-pieces. On the shoulder-pieces were two plates with six of the names of the children of Israel engraved on each plate. On the front of the ephod the high priest wore a breastplate composed of twelve precious stones set in gold. On each of the stones was engraved the name of one of the sons of Jacob. Thus, we have the robe, the ephod, the shoulder-pieces, and the breastplate. </p>

It portrays Christ expressed in His divinity and humanity with His attributes and virtues. Hence, the ephod is a composition of the expression of Christ in His divinity, humanity, attributes, and virtues. Then upon the ephod, upon the expression of Christ, there is the church. Both the shoulder plates and the breastplate symbolize the church. First, the church is symbolized as a testimony of the Lord Jesus. This is the function of the two shoulder-pieces, for two signifies a testimony. Thus, the two plates on the shoulders of the ephod signify the church as the testimony of Christ. The breastplate composed of twelve stones set in gold symbolizes the saints as transformed precious stones built together in the divine nature of Christ to become one entity. This is the built-up church. Therefore, the ephod with all that it bears, the three plates, is actually a picture of Christ and the church. This is a matter of great importance. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1398" id="1398">[1398]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqD5gR-pyUXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> What is the ephod with all that it bears? It is Christ with the church. Just as the three plates are the belongings of the ephod, so the church is the belonging of Christ. Without the three plates, the ephod would still be the ephod, but it would not have as much beauty. What beauty there is in the ephod with all it bears! The three plates are simply the additional beauty of the ephod. If these plates were removed, the ephod would still be beautiful. But when the plates are added to the ephod, the ephod has much more beauty. The entire ephod with the shoulder plates and the breastplate is a portrait of Christ with His church. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnhbMNXPmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> As we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36489" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">Exodus 28</span>, we need to lay hold of this picture in an all-inclusive way. This means that in these messages on the ephod we are speaking concerning Christ with what He is bearing, that is, Christ with the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH4qDasZW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> It is not an easy matter to study the types in the Old Testament. It is an especially difficult task to study the typology of the tabernacle, the priestly garments, and the offerings. The Brethren are experts in the areas of typology and prophecy. If you have ever studied the writings of the Brethren, you will see that they pay much attention to the two areas of typology and prophecy. I am thankful to the Lord for the years I was with them and for what I learned from them. However, I was never told that, in typology, the ephod with all it bears signifies Christ with the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzIJINzQ8DdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> The ephod is not merely a type of the glory of Christ or of certain of His virtues. Yes, the ephod itself does signify Christ. But what is borne upon the ephod, the shoulder plates and the breastplate, signifies God’s redeemed people, for on these plates were engraved the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. These names signify the redeemed people of God. For this reason, the ephod with what it bears portrays Christ with the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAub-x6EcD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK">CHAINS OF GOLD</h2><p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw3-SAlLLMBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36490" data-verses="Exodus 28:22">Exodus 28:22</span> says, “And you shall make upon the breastplate twined chains, a work of cords, of pure gold.” These two <span class="pg" data-page-id="1399" id="1399">[1399]</span> chains of gold signify Christ’s divine nature as the connecting element. In typology gold signifies the divine nature. The chains, no doubt, served the purpose of connecting, joining. Thus, these two chains of gold typify the divine nature of Christ as the connecting element. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZwLyR29KYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36491" data-verses="Exodus 28:22-27">Verses 22 through 27</span> are not easy to understand. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36492" data-verses="Exodus 28:23">verse 23</span>, two rings of gold were put upon the two ends of the breastplate. These two ends were at the top and were connected to the shoulder-pieces. Then two ribbons, made of linen, not of gold, were attached to the two bottom ends of the breastplate and bound the breastplate to the ephod. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36493" data-verses="Exodus 28:28">verse 28</span> says, “And they shall bind the breastplate by its rings unto the rings of the ephod with a ribbon of blue, that it may be upon the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate may not come loose from the ephod.” </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneDIMN7LUHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36494" data-verses="Exodus 28:22">Verse 22</span> mentions the two chains of gold that connected the top ends of the breastplate to the bottom ends of the two shoulder plates. These chains were made with twined cords of gold. The word twined signifies having passed through sufferings. This indicates that Christ’s divinity, having passed through sufferings, has become the connecting element. If there were no twined, golden cords made into chains, there would not be any connecting element. There would be nothing to join the breastplate to the shoulder plates. This necessary connecting element is Christ’s divinity. Christ’s divine nature is what joins us all together. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbouyQRBwzAoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> We have pointed out that the word “twined” signifies having passed through sufferings. Christ in His divine nature certainly has been twined; that is, He has gone through sufferings. When He lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, the divine nature within Him was twined. It passed through a great deal of suffering, a great deal of twining work. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83FvBavwSXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS">RINGS OF GOLD</h2><p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCkfCYvSKvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36495" data-verses="Exodus 28:23">Verse 23</span> says, “And you shall make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and put the two rings upon the two ends of <span class="pg" data-page-id="1400" id="1400">[1400]</span> the breastplate.” The two rings of gold on the two ends of the breastplate signify the Spirit of Christ as the holding element. In typology rings signify the Spirit. Now we have the chains signifying Christ’s divinity, and the rings signifying Christ’s Spirit. Perhaps you are wondering what is the difference between Christ’s divinity and Christ’s Spirit. Although they are very close, there is nevertheless some difference between them. Christ has divinity, the divine nature. He also has His Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, which is Christ Himself. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36496" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> speaks of Christ and also of the Spirit of Christ. Although it is correct to say that the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself, there is still a difference between Christ and the Spirit of Christ. However, it is difficult for us to explain what this difference is. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjMxBqiyxM7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> In the picture of the ephod we have the chains and the rings. If we had the chains without the rings, we could not have a complete connection. The chains were the connecting element, but the rings were the holding element. When we have both the connecting and holding elements, we have the proper joining. If you consider your experience carefully in a fine, detailed way, you will realize that, on the one hand, the divine nature of Christ within you is a connecting element and that, on the other hand, the Spirit of Christ within you is a holding element. Because we have both Christ’s divinity and Christ’s Spirit, we have a complete joining. </p>

God’s redeemed people are held on Christ’s heart in His love. They are also held on His shoulders, upheld by His bearing strength.

We would be held in love, but we would not be upheld with Christ’s bearing strength. By this picture we can see that we, God’s redeemed people, are both held in love and are upheld by Christ’s bearing strength. His heart holds us, and His shoulders uphold us. </p>

According to this article, the twelve names on the breastplate included eighteen of the twenty-two letters in the Hebrew alphabet. The remaining four letters were put on a piece called the Thummim. The Hebrew word Thummim means perfecters or completers. Thus, on the breastplate with the additional piece called the Thummim all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet could be found. Just as the twenty-six letters of the English alphabet on the keys of a typewriter can be used to compose a word, phrase, sentence, or paragraph, so the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet on the breastplate and the Thummim could be used to spell out words and sentences. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBa-IHKJKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> Furthermore, according to this article, the Urim was an illuminator inserted into the breastplate underneath the twelve stones. In Hebrew the word Urim means lights. This article in David Baron’s book says that the Urim had the capacity to contain oil for burning and that the fire used to burn this oil came from the altar. The Hebrew scholar <span class="pg" data-page-id="1406" id="1406">[1406]</span> responsible for this article also said that this Urim had twelve illuminators, one to illuminate each piece of stone on the breastplate. Then the transparent stones could shine with light. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf8q_roiD2ndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> When the Urim and the Thummim were added to the breastplate, they caused it to become the breastplate of judgment. Before they were added, the breastplate was simply for a memorial. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcPBjIJAazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> When God brought His people into the wilderness, He spoke to them through Moses. God spoke to Moses face to face. But after the death of Moses, Joshua received guidance from God not by His direct speaking in the way He spoke to Moses, but by the Urim and the Thummim on the breastplate worn by the high priest. Hence, whenever Joshua needed guidance concerning the move of the people, he had to go to the high priest who then received guidance from God by means of the Urim and the Thummim. Thus, God spoke through the Urim and the Thummim. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h9DUgAOMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> The writer of this article illustrates the function of the Urim and Thummim by referring to the case of Joshua and Achan. The children of Israel were defeated at Ai due to the sin of Achan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36513" data-verses="Joshua 7:1">Josh. 7</span>). How was Achan’s sin discovered? According to this article, a representative of each of the twelve tribes came to the tabernacle and stood before the high priest, who was wearing the breastplate. Suddenly one of the twelve pieces on the breastplate became dark. That was the stone for the tribe of Judah. In this way Judah was singled out. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36514" data-verses="Joshua 7:16-18">Joshua 7:16-18</span> says, “And the tribe of Judah was taken: And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken: And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.” It was also by the darkening of certain stones on the breastplate that the family and eventually the person were found out. In this situation the breastplate functioned like a spiritual and heavenly typewriter to spell out the name of Achan. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1407" id="1407">[1407]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFiuz7yNFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> This article cites other instances of the use of the Urim and the Thummim. It says that Joshua allotted the land to the tribes through the Urim and the Thummim (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36515" data-verses="Joshua 18:6-10">Josh. 18:6-10</span>), and also fought against the enemies according to the guidance of God made known by the Urim and the Thummim (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36516" data-verses="Judges 1:1-12">Judg. 1:1-12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36517" data-verses="Judges 20:18">20:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36518" data-verses="Judges 20:27">27</span>; see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36519" data-verses="Numbers 27:21">Num. 27:21</span>). Furthermore, when Saul the king became unfaithful to God, God would no longer answer him through the Urim and the Thummim (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36520" data-verses="1Samuel 28:6">1 Sam. 28:6</span>). When the priests were slain by Saul, one of the sons escaped to David, and David then followed the Lord by the Urim and the Thummim. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_FmtTj9qck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> We have pointed out that the breastplate was called the breastplate of judgment. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36521" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:8">Deuteronomy 33:8</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36522" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:10">10</span> say, “And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one....They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law.” Because the Urim and the Thummim were with the Levites, the priests, they could teach the people not only the law of God, but also His judgments. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_CmZV6fsZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> What we have covered thus far regarding the Urim and the Thummim are some of the historical facts according to scholarship. We have not yet seen anything concerning the spiritual application of the Urim and the Thummim. It is not my burden in this message to speak about historical facts; rather, it is to show the spiritual application. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQe2R9szxAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg">READING THE SAINTS</h2><p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755Tz_zLj99jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> The breastplate signifies the church with all the believers built up together as one entity. All the transformed believers who are built up to become the one entity known as the Body of Christ, the church, are letters for God’s speaking to us. This means that today, in the New Testament age, God speaks to the church through all the saints. We can see this in the way many of Paul’s Epistles were written. In writing to a particular church, Paul considered the saints in that local church. In other words, he considered the condition and situation of the saints in that locality. Then he used the condition and situation of the saints as letters in the spiritual alphabet to compose an epistle. Paul did not write any of <span class="pg" data-page-id="1408" id="1408">[1408]</span> his Epistles in an abstract way with vain thoughts. No, his Epistles were always based upon the condition and situation of the saints in a particular locality. Thus, those saints became the letters used by Paul in the spiritual typesetting of an epistle. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoACtCDw6AePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> What does this mean for us today? It simply means that in a local church the leading ones need to seek the Lord’s guidance by reading the actual situation and condition of the saints. For example, suppose the leading ones are considering whether or not the church should have a meeting for the preaching of the gospel. Before making a decision, they should consider the saints in their locality, asking what the condition of the saints is. Then based upon their reading of the condition and situation of the saints, the leading ones will have the guidance of the Lord. This will enable them to know whether or not at that time they should have a meeting for the preaching of the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyNkufKGJvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> The children of Israel went on by the guidance they received from the high priest’s reading of the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim in the presence of God. Today it is important for all the leading ones to read the condition and situation of the saints in their locality. In this way they will receive the leading of the Lord for the going on of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqD5gh-hikXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> For us today, the breastplate is the church, and the stones on the breastplate are the saints. Every saint bears some letters. Therefore, with the saints we have the letters of a heavenly and spiritual alphabet. Furthermore, by reading the condition and situation of the saints, we can have certain “words.” When these words are put together we have a complete sentence, a complete thought. This is the speaking of God through His redeemed saints as the letters. It is in this way that the congregation of the Lord knows how to go on. </p>

If we would understand the Urim and the Thummim, we should study the Old Testament and also consider our spiritual experience. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr8674SLe-6MJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s">TYPES OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnhbsNedGh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> In studying the Urim and the Thummim, we need to follow the principle that the types in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy are types of Christ. In these books there are types of the individual Christ and also of the corporate Christ, the church. This means that in the Pentateuch there are types of Christ Himself and types of Christ with the church. For example, we have the ark typifying Christ, and the tabernacle, made of forty-eight boards, typifying the church. Furthermore, with the priestly garments we have types of Christ and the church. The ephod typifies the expression of Christ, and the breastplate worn by the high priest typifies the church. Therefore, the breastplate on the ephod is a type of the church borne by Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1416" id="1416">[1416]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH4qjakLm2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> I would encourage the saints to take the time necessary to study the types of Christ with the church in the Pentateuch. I am very grateful to the Lord that during the years I was with the Brethren I learned biblical typology. Many of the types are not new to me. However, understanding the application of these types to our experience requires further study. In this message let us study the Urim and the Thummim according to the Old Testament and also try to apply this type to our experience according to today’s need. </p>

<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjMxBKixxs7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> Concerning the Urim and the Thummim, we have been helped by an appendix in David Baron’s book <em>The Ancient Scriptures and the Modern Jew.</em> The Urim and the Thummim were two items placed into the breastplate in addition to the twelve precious stones. In Hebrew the word Urim means lights, illuminators, and Thummim means completers, perfecters. The placing of the Urim and the Thummim into the breastplate caused the breastplate to become the breastplate of judgment. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1417" id="1417">[1417]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wJxtG3K-vl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e">Aaron</h2><p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8Yoa-JjqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> According to the history in the Old Testament, the Urim and the Thummim were placed upon a number of different persons. The first application was to Aaron (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36561" data-verses="Leviticus 8:8">Lev. 8:8</span>). Although Aaron bore the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim, it is doubtful that he ever made use of the Urim and Thummim. During the time Aaron was high priest, Moses was still alive. Moses was an extraordinary person, and the Bible tells us that God spoke to him directly, without any means, instrument, or intermediary. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36562" data-verses="Exodus 33:11">Exodus 33:11</span> says, “And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36563" data-verses="Numbers 12:8">Numbers 12:8</span> indicates that the Lord spoke with Moses “mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches.” Because the Lord spoke to Moses in such a direct and intimate way, there was no need during his lifetime for the Lord to make His will known to Aaron by means of the Urim and the Thummim. Aaron died before Moses did. Hence, even though Aaron wore the ephod with the breastplate and the Urim and the Thummim, he did not use them. In other words, during the time of Aaron’s priesthood, God did not speak to His people through the Urim and the Thummim, for He had a person, Moses, with whom He spoke face to face. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5G4HHIG4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP">Eleazar for Joshua</h2><p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fXw128TNcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> The Urim and Thummim were later applied to Eleazar, the son of Aaron. After Aaron and Moses died, Joshua came into the position to lead the children of Israel. God, however, did not speak to him as He spoke to Moses. Instead, God asked Moses to tell Joshua that if he wanted to know God’s will or leading, he had to go to the priest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36564" data-verses="Numbers 27:21">Num. 27:21</span>). At that time, the high priest was Eleazar. Therefore, Joshua had to go to Eleazar to receive the revelation of God’s will by means of the Urim and the Thummim. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vRtSdrhE6d_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> According to the appendix in David Baron’s book, it was through the Urim and Thummim that it was made known that Achan was the one whose sin had caused the defeat of the children of Israel at Ai. This is recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36565" data-verses="Joshua 7:16-21">Joshua 7:16-21</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="1418" id="1418">[1418]</span>. Through the Urim and the Thummim the tribe, the family, and the individual were singled out. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4buZI07WCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS">The Priests of Levi for Israel</h2><p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL835f6DP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> After Eleazar, the Urim and the Thummim were applied to each of the high priests of Levi for Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36566" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:8-10">Deut. 33:8-10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36567" data-verses="Ezra 2:63">Ezra 2:63</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36568" data-verses="Nehemiah 7:65">Neh. 7:65</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36569" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:8-10">Deuteronomy 33:8-10</span> we see what kind of person is qualified to obtain revelation through the Urim and the Thummim. This person must be not only holy but also godly. To be godly is to exhibit godliness, that is, to be one with God. A godly person is not only for God; he is also one with God. Someone who is merely holy may be for God, but someone who is godly is also one with God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36570" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:8-9">Deuteronomy 33:8 and 9</span> say, “And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy godly one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant” (lit.). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36571" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:9">Verse 9</span> indicates that between these godly ones and God there was no separation. Not even the members of their families separated them from God. This is very similar to what the Lord Jesus says in the Gospels: “He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36572" data-verses="Matthew 10:37">Matt. 10:37</span>). The Lord Jesus also said, “If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36573" data-verses="Luke 14:26">Luke 14:26</span>). Even in the Old Testament times Moses taught something the same in principle as what was taught by the Lord Jesus: not even our relationship with our family can be allowed to separate us from the Lord. </p>

We also considered the qualifications of those who used the breastplate and how it was applied to various people in the Old Testament. Furthermore, we saw that the Urim typifies Christ as the illuminator. Now we shall go on to consider the significance of the Thummim and how the Urim and the Thummim may be applied to our experience today. </p>

The Hebrew word for Thummim means completers, perfecters, and it typifies Christ as the completer and perfecter. We do not know how the Urim and the Thummim were added to the breastplate. However, we do know that both the Urim and the Thummim typify Christ and that the breastplate typifies the church. Therefore, the Urim and the Thummim added to the breastplate typify Christ added to the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wJxu23Cs_l3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> The twelve precious stones in the breastplate typify the believers, the components of the church, inscribed with <span class="pg" data-page-id="1424" id="1424">[1424]</span> Christ as the letters of the spiritual alphabet. According to the book of Revelation, Christ is the Alpha and the Omega. Since He is the first letter and the last, He is no doubt all the letters in between. This means that Christ is the alphabet used to compose words, sentences, paragraphs, chapters, and books. The letters inscribed on the twelve stones in the breastplate typify Christ as the letters in the heavenly alphabet. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyNkt_KGLvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> According to the appendix in David Baron’s book, four letters of the Hebrew alphabet were not inscribed on the stones set in the breastplate. Therefore, in order to have a complete Hebrew alphabet, it was necessary for the remaining letters to be supplied. That appendix also says that these four Hebrew letters were found on the Thummim. The Thummim, then, was a completer, a perfecter, of the letters on the breastplate. This indicates that no matter how much of Christ has been inscribed into us, we still are not complete. Some letters, something of Christ, are still missing. We need the completing Christ, the One who bears these missing letters. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqD5jB-hgkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR">THE NEED FOR CHRIST TO BE ADDED TO US</h2><p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDToyFxM4YAr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> The Urim added to the breastplate caused the twelve precious stones to shine. If some stones had been missing, there would have been a dark spot on the breastplate, indicating that something of Christ is missing. But the important point here is that even with all the stones inscribed with letters signifying the believers inscribed with Christ, there was still something missing. This signifies that even if the church is complete, perfect, and without defects or shortcomings, something of Christ is still missing. Hence, there is the need for the Christ typified by the Thummim to be added to the church, the breastplate. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XlLuYWYe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> Often the leading ones in the church realize that no matter how much the saints in their locality have been experiencing Christ or how much of Christ has been inscribed into them, something of Christ is still missing. All the believers need something additional of Christ. Although the saints <span class="pg" data-page-id="1425" id="1425">[1425]</span> may experience Christ and have Christ inscribed into their being, they are still short of Christ. Only Christ Himself can supply what is missing. Therefore, we need Christ as the completion. Furthermore, no matter how much we have experienced Christ and have had Him inscribed upon us, we shall still be in darkness if we depend on ourselves. We need Christ as the light, as the Urim, to be added to the church. Even though the precious stones on the breastplate had been inscribed with the names of all twelve of the tribes, there were still some Hebrew letters missing. Likewise, even though we may be rich in the experience of Christ, something of Christ is still lacking and can be made up by Him alone. We should never think that we have exhausted Christ. No, He is inexhaustible. Even after experiencing Him over a long period of time, we must admit that something of Christ is still missing. Therefore, we need Christ to be added to us. When this missing portion of Christ is added, we have the completion and the shining. </p>

The Christ whom we experience is the One who is inscribed into us. But even though we may have a great deal of Christ inscribed into us, we are still missing something of Christ. When we realize this, we may say, “I cannot have this completion in myself, but I can have it through the church.” However, if you try to find this completion in the church, you will not be successful. The church itself also needs this completion. Therefore, even if you have the church, you still need Christ as your completion. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLT_XkquJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> The fact that Christ is the alphabet for inscription and completion indicates that He is inexhaustible. We may have Him as the letters for inscription, but we still need Him as the letters for completion. We can never exhaust Christ, for although we may enjoy His inscription, there is still something more of Him that we need for completion. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1426" id="1426">[1426]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG7i-Rr8fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> By the Lord’s mercy and grace, I have been experiencing Christ for many years. When I went to Shanghai the first time, I was helped to experience Christ in a way I had not experienced Him in the past. After that visit to Shanghai, I returned to the north, where I held a conference and gave messages on Christ. I learned that no matter what my experience of Christ had been, while I was giving those messages, I realized that I had actually experienced very little of Christ. Regarding the experience of Christ, I then tried to receive help from the saints and from the church. However, I discovered that others were even more poor than I in experiencing Christ. In Shanghai I thought that I had experienced Christ to a great degree. But when I returned to the north and gave messages on Christ, I learned that I had not experienced Him very much at all. That was when I discovered what a great shortage there was among us with respect to the experience of Christ. Some saints had very little experience, and other saints had virtually no experience at all. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNG8y00MaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB">THE SHORTAGE OF THE INSCRIPTION OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0uz8Mx5qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> If you carefully examine the situation of Christians today, you will find out what poverty there is concerning the inscription of Christ. A certain believer may be very good, but he may still be opaque, lacking both in transformation and in the inscribing of Christ. Although such a believer has truly been saved, he has not yet been inscribed with Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBa9oHAbqzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> One day Brother Nee, referring to certain persons, asked me if I thought they had been regenerated. I knew those persons rather well and answered that it seemed to me that they had been saved. Brother Nee, somewhat in a joking way, replied, “Perhaps they have been saved, but not regenerated.” When I asked him how it was possible for someone to be saved without being regenerated, he answered, “Doctrinally, there is no such thing as a person who is saved but not regenerated. But according to actual experience, it seems that certain ones have been saved without being regenerated. No doubt, they have been redeemed by the blood, but although we have known them for years, we have never met <span class="pg" data-page-id="1427" id="1427">[1427]</span> their regenerated spirit. There is no question that they have been redeemed by the blood of Christ, but there is no indication of the Spirit that they have a regenerated spirit. They just don’t know to exercise their spirit.” It was surely the case that with these ones there was no inscription of Christ. </p>

We have also seen that the Thummim typifies Christ as the perfecter. As the Thummim, Christ is the alphabet for inscription and completion. Many Christians today do not have Christ inscribed into them in a clear, definite way. But even if we have the definite experience of Christ and the clear inscription of Christ, we still are not complete. Therefore, we need Christ to be added to us to be our completion. In this message we shall go further to see today’s application of the Urim and the Thummim. </p>

Suppose the twelve stones on the breastplate had been opaque instead of transparent. Furthermore, suppose nothing had been inscribed on any of the stones and no light was shining. Then the stones would have been opaque, without inscription, and without the shining of light. In such a case it would be impossible to use the breastplate to find out God’s will, God’s leading. This is the situation in most Christian groups today. There is no transparency, inscription, or light. It is <span class="pg" data-page-id="1430" id="1430">[1430]</span> very possible that this may be the situation of some local churches. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC8zUo-Ppy81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> Many years ago in mainland China I visited some so-called churches. It seemed to me that everyone in these groups was opaque, altogether lacking in transformation and transparency. Furthermore, little of Christ had been inscribed into the saints. It seemed they had Christ in name, but they were very short of the experience of Christ. Moreover, there was no light among them. What they needed was a very basic, elementary kind of help. God’s will could not be made known through them. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4buao07UCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> If you consider the condition of the majority of Christians today according to what we have covered in these messages, you will realize that in most cases with the believers there is opaqueness instead of transparency. There is virtually nothing of the inscription of Christ. Instead of the shining of light, there is darkness. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL80Zf6BP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> If as a local church we would be used by God as a breastplate, we all must be transparent, and we must have Christ inscribed into us. This means that we must have some definite experiences of Christ as the letters in God’s spiritual alphabet. Our experience of Christ must not be vague. Rather, it should be clear and definite. However, the situation among most Christians, including us, is very different from this. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cyjgzkmclAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> If we have been enlightened by the Lord and if we are bearing the burden of the Lord’s interests, we shall be troubled by the situation among God’s people. The more we consider the situation and condition of both the saints and the churches, the more burdened we shall be. We shall be deeply concerned about the lack of transparency, the lack of inscribing, and the shortage of light. </p>

In every local church there should be a group of leading ones who bear the saints and Christ on their heart. These leading ones need to see the Lord’s shining and read the saints. Then they will be able to receive God’s leading concerning the church in their locality. </p>

God speaks not through the stones that are shining, but through stones that become dark. This means that God speaks through negative situations. Normally the twelve stones in the breastplate were under the shining of the Urim. Suddenly a piece inscribed with a certain name would become dark. This darkening of a particular stone was God’s instant speaking. Our natural concept would be that God’s speaking through the breastplate came from the stones that were shining. Actually, He spoke through the stones that suddenly became dark. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4GJ-1K2xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> Paul’s Epistles and also the seven epistles of the Lord Jesus to the seven churches in Asia were all written according to this principle. They were written according to the negative situation of the churches, not according to the positive things found in the churches. Take, for example, Paul’s First Epistle to the Corinthians. If there were no negative things found in the church in Corinth, I doubt that 1 Corinthians would have been written. Paul wrote this Epistle according to his reading of the negative situation at Corinth. By considering that situation, he knew what to write. But although his writing was based on the negative things, in this Epistle he ministered positive things—the riches of Christ—to the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9EIoCMqyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> The problem among Christians today is that because there is so much darkness, there is no way for God to expose darkness. When everything is in darkness, it is difficult to point out a particular matter that is in darkness. Suppose in a room there are many rows of lights on the ceiling. If <span class="pg" data-page-id="1432" id="1432">[1432]</span> all the lights are shining, it will be easy to find one that becomes dark. This illustrates how God spoke through the breastplate. The darkening of a particular stone was God’s instant speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl-0fqmMovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> The situation of Christians today is abnormal. Instead of light, there is darkness. As a result, God has hardly any way to speak. In order for the darkness to be made known, there must first be the shining of light. If there is no light in a room, there is no way for darkness to be shown. But when all the lights are shining, it immediately becomes apparent when a certain light becomes dark. That darkness is an indicator that something is wrong. If in a certain church things that are wrong are easily found out, that church is normal. But if in a particular church it is not possible to find out what is wrong, this is an indication that the church there is in darkness. When darkness prevails, it is not possible for negative matters to be exposed. For this, light is necessary. What is exposed under the shining of the light is God’s speaking. God speaks through things becoming negative. This kind of negative situation is an indicator of the shortage of Christ. By reading the negative situations in this way, we come to know God’s leading. Then in our locality we shall know what God wants us to do, and we should then follow His leading. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yI_0Yd1c9qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS">JUDGMENT AND SUPPLY</h2><p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9JLCfLiaRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> The leading obtained through the breastplate always involves a judgment. This means that the Lord’s speaking through the breastplate is through negative situations. If this speaking were only through positive situations, there would be no need of judgment, for everything would be positive and justified. But because the Lord’s speaking is through negative situations, that speaking is a judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldXwz89E8JlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> The Apostle Paul was one who was truly shining. Under the shining of Paul, the darkness was exposed. Paul wrote certain of his Epistles according to the darkness, according to the negative condition, of the saints in the churches. Because Paul saw certain dark areas in the church in <span class="pg" data-page-id="1433" id="1433">[1433]</span> Corinth, areas that were letters of God’s judgment, Paul could write Corinthians as a book of judgment. But along with all the judgment contained in this Epistle, there are many positive things: the riches of Christ ministered to the believers at Corinth. This is God’s way of speaking. Both in the Old Testament and the New Testament, God’s speaking is according to the negative situation, yet with the riches of Christ as the supply for His people. </p>

First, we need to be transformed and transparent. Then Christ as the letters of the spiritual alphabet must be inscribed into us clearly and definitely. This is to have the adequate experience of Christ. </p>

This is especially true of the priestly garments, garments that were for glory and beauty. Beauty and glory are both for expression. In a foregoing message we pointed out that, humanly speaking, garments are for covering, for warmth, and for beauty. But in the record concerning the priestly garments, the emphasis is on beauty and glory. Beauty is human, and glory is divine. Hence, the priestly garments are the expression of Christ’s human beauty and divine glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6aOwcNi4s4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> The garments worn by the high priest were unusual. First, there was a tunic, which may have reached the ankles. Over the tunic there was a robe, which reached to the feet, and upon the robe there was the ephod. Upon the ephod there were the breastplate and the two shoulder-pieces. All these garments contain significant aspects of typology regarding Christ with the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cBxqOVTRiWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa">THE EXPRESSION OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUXh5uAMrQmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> Christ is the expression of God. The incarnated Christ is the embodiment of God, and this embodiment is an expression. No one has ever seen God, but the Son of God, the only begotten, has manifested Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36608" data-verses="John 1:18">John 1:18</span>). This manifestation of God in Christ is God’s expression. This means that Christ is the expression of the invisible and mysterious God. As the expression of God, Christ makes God visible and practical. When we contact Christ, we contact the visible, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1436" id="1436">[1436]</span> practical God. Now God is no longer only mysterious and invisible; in Christ, He is practical and visible. Christ as God’s expression has made God visible and practical to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNH-y00OaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> The expression of God is both individual and corporate. As God’s expression, Christ is not only individual, but also corporate. When Christ was on earth, He was the individual expression of God. But after His death and resurrection, this expression became corporate. In the four Gospels we see the individual Christ. But in Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation, Christ is no longer merely individual, for He has become corporate. In the Epistles and Revelation we see the corporate Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0vx8Mx7qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p">THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBb_oHDbKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> In this message we shall consider the robe worn by the high priest. What does this long robe signify in typology? To find the answer, let us turn to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36609" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">Isaiah 6:1</span>: “In the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.” According to this verse, Isaiah had a vision of the Lord sitting in the temple. The word “train” here refers to the skirt of the Lord’s long robe. Isaiah does not tell us how long this skirt was, but he does say that it filled the temple. No one has ever seen a bride whose wedding garment was so long that it filled the place where the wedding was held. No bride has such a fullness. But because the Lord is so full, His skirt fills the temple, His dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf8r-LoqRmndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> What does this long train signify? It signifies the expression of Christ’s virtues (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36610" data-verses="John 12:41">John 12:41</span>). The Lord’s fullness is shown in all His virtues. Suppose the Lord was very much lacking in virtue. In that case He would not be expressed by a long garment with the train filling the temple, for He would not have any fullness. If someone were to wear a garment that did not properly cover his body, this would indicate that this person was short of virtue. But if he is properly covered, this shows that he is full of virtue. The Lord is full of virtue. Therefore, when He sits in His dwelling <span class="pg" data-page-id="1437" id="1437">[1437]</span> place, His long train fills the temple. This means that the Lord’s dwelling place is full of His virtue. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeRNbWzqNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36611" data-verses="Psalms 133:1">Psalm 133</span> also refers to the long robe of the high priest. When the divine anointing oil was poured upon Aaron, the high priest, that ointment ran down from the head to the beard and then to the skirts of his garment. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36612" data-verses="Revelation 1:13">Revelation 1:13</span>, the Lord Jesus has a garment reaching to the feet. This is a sign that the Lord’s virtues are so extensive that they become His fullness. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bROj3NEKXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> We should never think that the Lord’s long robe is devoid of significance. Based upon biblical usage, such a long robe surely signifies the virtues of Christ, and these virtues are His expression. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He expressed God in the divine virtues. If His human living had been short of these virtues, it would not have been possible for Him to express God. God was expressed in Jesus through the divine virtues. As He walked on earth, He walked in a way that was full of virtue. His expression certainly had a long train. For example, when He was in that little cottage in Bethany, His train filled the room. Likewise, when He walked on the streets of Jerusalem, His virtues filled the city. That was the expression of God. Therefore, in the Bible a long garment with a long skirt signifies the fullness of the virtues of the one clothed with that garment. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJpydO--Uiqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> In this universe what is the fullness of Christ? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36613" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span> says that the church is the fullness of the One who fills all in all. How great Christ is! He is all-inclusive and all-extensive, filling all in all. Because He is so great, inclusive, and extensive, He surely needs a fullness to express what He is. This fullness is the church. </p>

First this train was in the heavens. Then it descended to Jerusalem and spread to Antioch, Philippi, Corinth, and Rome. Eventually, it spread to Asia and then to the western hemisphere. Now the long train of Christ is wrapping the globe. Compared to <span class="pg" data-page-id="1438" id="1438">[1438]</span> this train, the earth is very small. It is covered by the church. Even though the church has become degraded, it cannot be denied that nothing is more prosperous and far-reaching in human history than the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9aTplOfEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> When I left the mainland of China thirty-three years ago, there were not more than four million Christians in China. Recently I read a newspaper article which says that now in China there are forty million believers. Furthermore, we have learned that in just one county in a certain province there are one hundred forty thousand believers pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. This proves that God is living and that Christ is mighty. Communist countries are known for being atheistic and for restricting the activities of Christians. But after thirty-three years, there are ten times more believers in China today than there were in 1949. This is the stretching, the lengthening, of the long robe of Christ. His train cannot be broken. The more there is persecution of the Christians, the farther His long robe extends. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfXHnmRxvPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> I have also read that today in Russia the number of those who attend church services is five times the number of those who attend in England. This reminds me of an article I read in 1944. Stalin had asked the United States for aid. President Roosevelt told him that because so many American taxpayers were Christians, Russia would have to open the churches once again before aid could be given. Roosevelt pointed out that his people could not help one who persecutes Christians. Stalin thought that since the churches had been closed for years, there probably were not many Christians left. Therefore, he promised Roosevelt to open the churches. To his great surprise, at Easter, 1944, crowds of Christians gathered into the church buildings for Easter worship. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr8675T7e7o8JK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> Christ the Lord is full of divine attributes and human virtues. In history there has never been a person with so many attributes and virtues. Now the expression of His virtues and attributes makes up a long train, a train that covers the whole earth. This train is the church, the fullness <span class="pg" data-page-id="1439" id="1439">[1439]</span> of Christ. Praise Him that we all are parts of Christ’s long robe! </p>

The breastplate and shoulder-pieces were attached to the ephod, and the ephod was upon the robe. Underneath the long robe was the tunic, which was the same as that worn by the other priests. </p>

This plate is a blossom, and the blossom is a holy crown. This plate, this crown, was placed upon the turban (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36630" data-verses="Exodus 28:37">28:37</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQe3QNs7iwajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> The turban worn by the high priest was a kind of headgear or headtire. On his head the high priest wore this particular head covering made of linen. The plate of pure gold was upon the turban, the linen head covering. Therefore, the plate and the turban go together. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9FKoCMoyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36631" data-verses="Exodus 28:40">28:40</span>, tunics were made for Aaron and his sons. This indicates that the tunics were worn by the high priest and also by the other priests. The tunic was a long coat or robe, probably a little shorter than the robe worn by the high priest. For the high priest, this tunic was an inner <span class="pg" data-page-id="1446" id="1446">[1446]</span> robe. But for the other priests, it was an outer robe, since they did not wear the long robe over the tunic. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl_2fqmOovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36632" data-verses="Exodus 28:39-40">Verses 39 and 40</span> also indicate that the high priest and the other priests wore girdles. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36633" data-verses="Exodus 28:39">Verse 39</span> speaks of “a girdle, the work of an embroiderer.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36634" data-verses="Exodus 28:40">Verse 40</span> says that girdles were to be made for Aaron’s sons. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36635" data-verses="Exodus 28:42-43">Verses 42 and 43</span> speak of the linen breeches worn by Aaron and his sons: “And you shall make for them linen breeches to cover the naked flesh; from the loins even to the thighs they shall be. And they shall be upon Aaron and upon his sons when they go into the tent of meeting, or when they come near to the altar to minister in the holy place, that they may not bear iniquity and die. It shall be a statute forever for him and for his seed after him.” These linen breeches were trousers, short pants, reaching down to the knee, so that they covered the naked flesh from the loins to the thighs. Therefore, they signify Christ covering the nakedness of the fallen flesh. The fact that these linen breeches were to be upon the priests whenever they functioned indicates that we need Christ to cover us whenever we function as priests. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yJ90Ye189qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36636" data-verses="Exodus 28:36-43">28:36-43</span> we have five items: the plate, the turban, the tunic, the girdle, and the breeches. Only the high priest wore the plate of gold, but all the priests wore turbans, tunics, girdles, and breeches. The high priest wore a tunic, the long robe with pomegranates and bells, the ephod, the shoulder-pieces, the breastplate, and the crown. All the other priests wore a tunic, a turban, a girdle, and breeches. In foregoing messages, we have considered the significance of the ephod, the shoulder-pieces, the breastplate, and the long robe with the pomegranates and golden bells. We have yet to see the significance of the golden plate on the linen turban. Furthermore, we need to know the significance of the clothing worn by all the priests—the linen turban, the tunic, the girdle, and the breeches. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9IJCfIi6RI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9">HOLINESS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldWyz8-FcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> If we would understand the significance of the various aspects of the priestly garments, we need to see the principle <span class="pg" data-page-id="1447" id="1447">[1447]</span> that all these garments are for expression. They are signs, symbols, expressions. As we carefully read the account of the priestly garments and study this account, we see that these garments are signs. Not only are they for beauty and glory, but they signify, express, symbolize, something. Furthermore, it is important to realize that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36637" data-verses="Exodus 28:36-43">28:36-43</span> is the final word concerning the priestly garments. Usually a concluding word gives us the exact meaning of a certain thing. When we first begin to talk about something, our word may be somewhat unclear. But our concluding word makes the matter very clear. This principle also applies to the description of the priestly garments in Exodus. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6aOgcLxIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> The conclusion of the record of the priestly garments involves holiness and righteousness. Holiness is clearly signified in the golden plate with the inscription “Holy unto Jehovah.” Suppose a high priest clothed in all his garments were standing in front of you. You would see the long robe, the ephod, the shoulder-pieces, the breastplate, and the turban. Upon the turban would be a golden plate engraved with “Holy unto Jehovah.” Surely you would be impressed with the matter of holiness. Holiness was the mark of the high priest’s garments, and was even branded on the golden plate. Thus, the full view of the high priestly garments signifies the holiness of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cBxqOFTYxWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> Second, the turban, the tunic, the girdle, and the breeches were all made of linen. According to the typology in the Bible, linen signifies righteousness. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36638" data-verses="Revelation 19:8">Revelation 19:8</span> says that the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints. Therefore, the golden plate is a sign of holiness, and the turban, the tunic, the girdle, and the breeches, all made of linen, are a sign of righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUXh5-AE4AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> As we consider the garments worn by the high priest, we see gold in the shoulder-pieces, in the breastplate, and on the head plate. Gold is the main element of both the shoulder-pieces and the breastplate. But even more significant, the head plate was made entirely of gold. Another primary element of the priestly garments was linen. As we have pointed out, gold signifies divinity, and linen signifies humanity. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1448" id="1448">[1448]</span> With divinity we receive an impression of holiness, and with humanity, an impression of righteousness. Holiness is not a matter of sinless perfection. Rather, holiness is the divine nature. Divinity in nature is holy. Therefore, holiness is always related to divinity. Righteousness, however, is a virtue of humanity. The most important human virtue, the virtue that includes all others, is righteousness. If you are not a righteous person, you do not have any other virtues. But if you are righteous, your righteousness will include other virtues. Both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament, holiness and righteousness are emphasized. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-86KzFcZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> The Lord Jesus Christ has two natures, divinity and humanity. We who believe in Him also have two natures, the human nature and the divine nature. Both we and the Lord Jesus possess the divine nature for holiness and the human nature for righteousness. Therefore, we are both holy and righteous, both divine and human. Holiness is the main divine attribute, and righteousness is the main human virtue. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36639" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">Ephesians 4:24</span> Paul says that the new man, the church, is created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. On the one hand, we are holy in the divine nature; on the other hand, we must be righteous in our humanity. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMFPaIRh-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC">NORMAL AND PROPER PERSONS</h2><p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbEJP9gL7nhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> Having covered the matters of holiness and righteousness, we must go on to speak concerning the priests themselves. Priests are the most normal and proper persons. If as a human being you are not a priest serving God, you are not normal. A proper human being is one who is a priest, one who serves God. If a lawyer or a professor does not serve God, he is not a proper person. If we are not priests serving God, we are abnormal. You may think that you are very good, even excellent. But no matter how good we may be, we are improper and abnormal if we are not priests. Praise the Lord that we can declare that we are priests serving God! This means that we are normal, proper persons. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0WTyMJtjMWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> In order to be priests, we must be holy and righteous. This means that we should have the virtues of holiness <span class="pg" data-page-id="1449" id="1449">[1449]</span> toward God and righteousness toward men. This holiness and righteousness are signified by the priestly garments. We need to ask ourselves what kind of garments we are wearing. If we are priests, those who are normal and proper, we are wearing holiness and righteousness as our garments. Our priestly garments are holiness and righteousness. </p>

<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCu8ZB2LvVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> Christ is guarding, protecting, caring for, the holiness that God has gained among us. As we have pointed out, this involves a fourfold holiness, a series of four steps in which we become more and more holy. We may be in the holy land producing a holy harvest. However, our experience of holiness may not be very definite. Thus, we may not understand much about setting aside the tithe, the top portion, of the holy produce. It is not easy to understand fully what is this top tenth that is set aside for God. It is even more difficult to explain what is that portion of the tithe that is separated to be absolutely for God and His priests. We can speak concerning these matters, but it is not easy to describe them from the standpoint of our experience, because our experience is limited. We know that, according to typology, Christ, our High Priest today, is safeguarding the holiness God has among us. But it is difficult to go further to explain how we may have in our experience a higher and higher degree of holiness. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1458" id="1458">[1458]</span> </p>

Even in the classical Chinese writings a word is used for holiness, and Confucius is called a saint. According to the traditional Chinese understanding, to be holy is simply to be upright; it is to be right with others in every way. Certain learned Chinese used to say that it is possible even for a saint like Confucius to be wrong. This indicates that their understanding of holiness is related to uprightness. When those with this understanding of holiness read the words holy or holiness in the Bible, they spontaneously have the thought of being upright. Eventually, I began to question whether this is what the Bible means by holiness. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9aTJlOdEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> Certain denominations emphasize a particular concept of holiness. These groups include the Church of the Nazarene, the Church of God, and some Pentecostal groups. They are the so-called holiness churches and follow regulations concerning such things as clothing, hair style, and behavior. According to their understanding, believers are holy if they follow these regulations. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfXHHmSxPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> Another concept of holiness is related to what is called sinless perfection. John Wesley and those with him developed certain methods to control their behavior, and they taught that holiness was a matter of sinless perfection. But the Brethren, who were raised up about one hundred sixty years ago, pointed out that in the Bible holiness does not mean sinless perfection. They pointed out that the Greek word for holiness denotes something separated to God. They referred to the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36655" data-verses="Matthew 23:17">Matthew 23:17</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36656" data-verses="Matthew 23:19">19</span> concerning the temple sanctifying the gold and the altar sanctifying the gift. They showed that this was to make the gold holy in position by changing its position from a <span class="pg" data-page-id="1459" id="1459">[1459]</span> common place to a holy one. Likewise, the gift was made holy in position because its location was changed from a common place to a holy one. They went on to argue that sanctification has nothing to do with sin. How can gold commit sin? Likewise, a sheep, an ox, or a bird presented on the altar and sanctified cannot sin. Therefore, these Brethren teachers concluded, holiness is not a matter of sinlessness, but is a matter of separation. The gold in the market is common, secular. But the gold in the temple is separated, holy. Likewise, cattle in the flock are common, but those offered on the altar are holy. Realizing that this teaching concerning holiness is scriptural, I accepted it. However, in my reading of the New Testament I came to see that holiness involves more than separation. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36657" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span> speaks of sanctification of the Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36658" data-verses="Hebrews 12:10">Hebrews 12:10</span> says that God disciplines us so that we may partake of His holiness. Verses such as these certainly indicate something deeper than mere positional separation. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36659" data-verses="Romans 6:22">Romans 6:22</span> speaks of “fruit unto sanctification.” This is another indication that holiness, or sanctification, involves something deeper than positional separation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr8675Tbe4ocJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s">TWO ASPECTS OF SANCTIFICATION</h2><p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnga8NXOmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> Concerning the proper understanding of holiness, I have been helped by the writings of Brother Nee. More than fifty years ago, I read a booklet of his in which he says that righteousness is God’s way of doing things, holiness is God’s nature, and love is God’s heart. That word concerning holiness being God’s nature led me into a new field of exploration in the Word. During the past fifty years, I have been exploring the biblical field of holiness. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH5rzasYW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> Now I see that holiness, sanctification, has both a positional and a dispositional aspect. The Brethren emphasized positional sanctification as illustrated by the gold in the temple and the gift on the altar. In this kind of sanctification, neither the gold nor the gift is changed in nature; it is changed only in position. The Brethren, however, did not <span class="pg" data-page-id="1460" id="1460">[1460]</span> see the dispositional aspect of sanctification, the sanctification that takes place in our disposition, in our being. According to the Bible, sanctification is a matter both of position and of disposition. Hence, we need positional sanctification and dispositional sanctification as well. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzIJJMDQ8CdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> The books of 1 and 2 Thessalonians are concerned with a holy life for the church life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36660" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:13">1 Thessalonians 3:13</span> Paul says, “That He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.” What does it mean for our hearts to be established blameless in holiness? When we read these words in 1 Thessalonians, we may take them for granted and assume that we understand them. We should not take for granted that we understand this matter. Surely for our hearts to be established blameless in holiness involves dispositional sanctification. It is not merely positional separation or sinless perfection. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAua_B6EdD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36661" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:3">1 Thessalonians 4:3</span> Paul says that the will of God is our sanctification, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36662" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:7">verse 7</span>, that God has called us in sanctification. This is the continuation of his word regarding sanctification in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36663" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">1 Thessalonians 3</span>. At the end of 1 Thessalonians, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36664" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:1">chapter five</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36665" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">verse 23</span>, Paul says, “And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Certainly this is a further development of holiness or sanctification. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw3-TBVLLPBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw">THE OPERATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br/>AND ITS RESULTS</h2><p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZwKzh29JYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36666" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">First Peter 1:2</span> says, “According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.” Here we have the foreknowledge of the Father, the sanctification of the Spirit, and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. This verse raises a significant doctrinal question: How can the sanctification by the Spirit come before the sprinkling of the blood of Christ? Theologically speaking, the sprinkling <span class="pg" data-page-id="1461" id="1461">[1461]</span> of the blood must precede the sanctification of the Spirit. But in this verse the order is reversed. According to the first chapter of 1 Peter, the blood of Christ redeems us not from sin, but from our vain manner of life received by tradition (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36667" data-verses="1Peter 1:18">v. 18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneDJN97IVnXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> Recently, as I have been considering <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36668" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">1 Peter 1</span>, I have seen that this chapter is concerned with the operation of the Triune God on His elect for their participation in His full salvation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36669" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span> we see the Triune God, for this verse speaks of the election of the Father, according to His foreknowledge, the sanctification of the Spirit, and the sprinkling by the blood of Jesus Christ. This is the operation of the Triune God. </p>

<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJpyd--5Hiqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> In this message we come to another section of the book of Exodus. We have covered the tabernacle with its furnishings and also the priestly garments. When God’s people were gathered at Mount Sinai, Moses received the revelation of the pattern of the tabernacle and the design of the furniture of the tabernacle. The children of Israel were to build a house, a sanctuary, for the Lord to dwell among them and for His people to serve Him. Following this, the book of Exodus records a description of the priestly garments. </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRE8K6ggxmTX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> In the Bible garments signify our living, behavior, conduct, and character. This indicates that, concerning the priests, God’s serving ones, Exodus first takes care of their outward conduct signified by the priestly garments. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36682" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span> we have a section dealing with the sanctification of Aaron and his sons to be priests. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJ2ghVYPtP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO">FILLING OUR EMPTY HANDS</h2><p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9aTZlGP0fCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> Those who read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36683" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> can easily be impressed with what is often called the consecration of the priests. Apparently this chapter is concerned with consecration, for here we see that the priests and their garments have been made ready and need to be consecrated. Some versions use the word ordination instead of consecration. This translation of the Bible is based on the traditional, religious practice of ordination. Actually, there is no ground for this translation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36684" data-verses="Exodus 29:9">Verse 9</span> says, “And you shall gird them with a girdle, Aaron <span class="pg" data-page-id="1466" id="1466">[1466]</span> and his sons, and bind caps on them; and the priesthood shall be theirs for an eternal statute; and you shall consecrate Aaron and his sons.” The Hebrew word rendered consecrate literally means “fill their hand.” Neither the word consecrate nor the word ordain is accurate. Therefore, I prefer not to use the word consecrate in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36685" data-verses="Exodus 29:9">verse 9</span>. What this verse talks about is the filling of the priests’ hands. Because their hands were empty, they needed their hands to be filled. This indicates that we cannot serve God empty-handed. If we would serve Him, our hands must be filled with Christ. Thus, to consecrate the priests, to ordain them (if we want to use that word), means the filling of their hands. The hands of those who serve the Lord need to be filled with Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-86qzFeZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36686" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">29:1</span> the word sanctify is used: “And this is the thing which you shall do to them to sanctify them to serve as priests to Me: Take one young bull and two rams without blemish.” To sanctify something is absolutely different from ordaining it or consecrating it. To sanctify means to set something apart. For example, there may be many cattle in a herd, but one of these cattle is set apart from the herd. As a result, that animal is sanctified. Furthermore, when an animal is set apart from the herd or flock, a mark may be put on it to indicate that it has been set apart. Hence, to sanctify means to set something apart with a certain mark. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMFP6IRj-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> Formerly we were among all the sinners in the world. But one day the Lord set us apart. Salvation is an all-inclusive matter, and it includes being set apart. One day the Lord Jesus came to set us apart, that is, to save us. He separated us from sinners. To be saved and set apart in this way is to be sanctified. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbEJPdgI7HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> The Lord’s sanctifying always labels us, puts a mark upon us. We bear a mark to indicate that we have been saved, sanctified, and set apart unto God. Do you know what is the mark that separates us and sets us apart? This mark is Christ Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0WTysJujsWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> When we were among sinners, we were empty. Not only were we empty-handed, but our whole being was empty. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1467" id="1467">[1467]</span> When we were saved, Christ came into us and became the mark that sets us apart from empty sinners. From that time on, we have had something within us, something in our hand, with which to serve God. Many Christians, however, do not realize this. No one has told them they have Christ to fill their hand. Nevertheless, from the time we were saved, we have had Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcOAzIJBazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> Since we have Christ, we should not come to God empty-handed. Rather, we should always come to Him with Christ. This is the reason we pray and meet in the name of the Lord Jesus. To meet in the Lord’s name is to meet with Him. Those, such as the Jews, who pray to God without praying in the name of the Lord Jesus, pray to Him in a way that is empty-handed. But our praying in the name of the Lord Jesus is different because we are praying to God with our hands filled. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h8CEgAPMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> Now we can understand that consecration in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36687" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> means to fill our hands. Genuine consecration is the filling up of our emptiness with Christ. This also is sanctification. Whenever we come to the meetings, we should have something of Christ to offer to God. We should not come to the meetings empty-handed. To be empty-handed in the meetings is to be condemned. We all should be priests whose hands are filled with Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFjvj7yMFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s">THE SIN OFFERING</h2><p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_FnsDj9rck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> Aaron, the high priest, experienced the Passover in Egypt. In relation to the filling up of Aaron’s empty hands, the sin offering was the first offering presented to God. Was this not a repetition of the Passover? Did not the Passover include the sin offering? These questions are not easy to answer. We all experienced the Passover when we were saved. Why, then, do we still need the sin offering? Why in the filling up of the priests’ empty hands was there still the need for the sin offering? When we were saved and experienced the Passover, our sins were forgiven. Nevertheless, when we come to the Lord, we still need the sin offering. No matter how long we have been saved, whenever we come to <span class="pg" data-page-id="1468" id="1468">[1468]</span> serve God, we need the sin offering because we are still living in the flesh, in the old creation. To serve God as priests requires the sin offering. Even to contact the Lord during morning watch requires the sin offering. Serving the Lord as a priest is a great matter, and contacting Him in the morning watch is a comparatively small matter, but in both cases we need the sin offering and the trespass offering. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_CnYF6fvZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M">THE MARK OF SEPARATION</h2><p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQe3QtszyAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> To consecrate someone to be God’s priest is to sanctify him, and to sanctify him is to set him apart. In order for someone to be set apart to serve God as a priest, his hands need to be filled. This filling up of the hands becomes a mark that sets him apart from everything that is common. If I have something of Christ filling my hands, this indicates that I have been set apart. Whoever has Christ in his hands to fill his emptiness is set apart, sanctified. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755Ty-jLg8djlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> Not only is it inaccurate to use the word consecrate in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36688" data-verses="Exodus 29:9">verse 9</span>, but it is also inappropriate, because it somewhat hinders the proper understanding of what is recorded in this chapter. When we read the word consecrate, we may automatically think about dedicating ourselves to the Lord. But as we have pointed out, the meaning of consecrate here is to have Christ filling up our emptiness. In ourselves we are empty-handed. Now we need our empty hands to be filled with Christ. Having our hands filled is not a matter of consecration; it is to sanctify us, to set us apart, to make us different from others. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoACsDTw5B-PzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> If our hands are filled with Christ, those in our family, neighborhood, or place of employment will realize that we are different. But if we are common, if there is no difference between us and unbelievers, then we are not priests. What makes us different from others is that we have Christ filling our hands. Wherever we may be, at school, at work, or at home, we need to have hands full of Christ. Being filled up with Christ will then be a mark that sets us apart from those who are common. Others will recognize that we are different. They are still empty-handed, but our hands are <span class="pg" data-page-id="1469" id="1469">[1469]</span> full of Christ. To have hands filled with Christ is to be sanctified to be a priest. </p>

This offering was burned completely. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36714" data-verses="Exodus 29:13-14">Exodus 29:13 and 14</span> say, “And you shall take all the fat that covers the inwards, and the appendage on the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat which is upon them, and burn them on the altar. And the flesh of the bull, and its skin, and its dung, you shall burn with fire outside the camp; it is a sin offering.” These verses speak of two different kinds of burning. The first burning, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1476" id="1476">[1476]</span> described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36715" data-verses="Exodus 29:13">verse 13</span>, is the burning on the altar of the fat, the appendage on the liver, and the kidneys. This burning produced a sweet savor that ascended to God for His satisfaction. It was like the burning of incense, a burning that was not for judgment or purification, but for God’s enjoyment. The Hebrew word rendered “burn” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36716" data-verses="Exodus 29:13">verse 13</span> is a term used for burning incense (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36717" data-verses="Exodus 29:18">verses 18</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36718" data-verses="Exodus 29:25">25</span>). When the priests burned the incense as a sweet savor, that was for God’s satisfaction. God enjoyed the aroma of the incense. Regarding the sin offering, the inward fat and certain inward parts were burned for God’s enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw3-TA1LLNBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> This burning satisfied God’s requirements, which are mainly of three categories: the requirements of His righteousness, holiness, and glory. God is righteous, God is holy, and God is full of glory. Thus, His righteousness, holiness, and glory all make demands of us. If we are short of God’s glory and do not match His righteousness and holiness, we fail to fulfill His requirements and therefore come under His condemnation. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZwKyB29LYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> It is the fat of the sin offering that satisfies God’s requirements. The fat of cattle comes out of the richness of the cattle. This typifies the sweetness and the richness of Christ’s perfection and satisfies the requirements of God’s righteousness, holiness, and glory. The burning of the fat and the inward parts produces a sweet savor for God’s satisfaction; He is fully satisfied with it. Therefore, the first kind of burning related to the sin offering was for God’s satisfaction. </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneDJMd7LVHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> The second kind of burning, described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36719" data-verses="Exodus 29:14">verse 14</span>, was the burning of the flesh, the skin, and the dung outside the camp. These parts of the sin offering were burned with the fire of judgment. Hence, the second burning was a burning of judgment. It did not take place on the altar, but took place outside the camp, signifying abandonment and judgment. On the one hand, Christ was accepted as a sweet savor to God to satisfy all of God’s requirements; on the other hand, Christ was abandoned, condemned, judged, and burned <span class="pg" data-page-id="1477" id="1477">[1477]</span> outside the camp, outside God’s dwelling place and away from God’s people. </p>

If we would be priests serving God, we need to realize that even though we have been saved, we still have a sinful nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCkeCIvSJvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> We shall continue to have this sinful nature until our body is transfigured. I can testify that no matter how long we have been saved, our sinful nature does not change. I have been saved for more than fifty-five years. Nevertheless, I must testify that my sinful nature is still with me. We should never believe the doctrine of eradication, the teaching that the sinful nature is eradicated when a person becomes a believer in Christ. No, our sinful nature still exists. Therefore, whenever we come to serve God as priests, we must remember that we have a sinful nature and that we need Christ as our sin offering to deal with this nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjMwB6ixws7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> Christ has fulfilled God’s requirements to satisfy Him, and He has borne God’s judgment on our behalf. In Him our sinful nature has been judged. Whenever we take Christ as our sin offering, we judge ourselves as sinners, even as sin. Again and again, we need Christ as our sin offering and we need to be judged. Paul refers to Christ as the sin offering in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36720" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Romans 8:3</span>, when he says that God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, and condemned sin in the flesh. </p>

In ourselves <span class="pg" data-page-id="1478" id="1478">[1478]</span> we are sinful. We are sinners, even sin itself. How we need Christ as our sin offering! This is the reason Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36722" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>, “Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God’s righteousness in Him.” </p>

As the sin offering, Christ was also abandoned by God and judged by Him for us. The washing of the word mainly deals with outward defilement. The sin offering deals with the sinful nature within. To be a priest, it is not adequate simply to confess that we have been defiled by the earthly touch and need to be washed. We must also realize and admit that even we who would be priests serving God still have a sinful nature. We are still sinners. Therefore, we need Christ to be our sin offering. We need Him with all His perfections to be burned for God’s satisfaction. We also need Christ to be burned to bear God’s judgment on our behalf. </p>

If we would be priests serving God, we need the outward washing of the word, and we also need to put on Christ as our garment. However, we also need the inward nourishing and filling. This nourishing requires a deeper cleansing, a cleansing by Christ as our sin offering. This cleansing deals with our sinful nature. Whenever you come to serve God as a priest, you must realize and confess that your nature is still sinful. If you do not have this realization, you will not be able to enjoy the Christ typified by the rams, the unleavened bread, the unleavened, perforated cakes, and the unleavened wafers. We cannot enjoy Christ adequately without realizing that we have a sinful nature and need Christ to be our sin offering. </p>

<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fWwV27ANcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> I believe that the Lord wants to speak to us a very sweet word from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36735" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span> of Exodus. This portion of the Bible, however, is not easy to understand. As we read this chapter, we need the proper exercise of our mind. Otherwise, we may be led into the woods and not find the right direction. As we approach this chapter, we need to be calm and very sober. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vRsS9rnXqd_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> More than fifty years ago, I was taught by certain Bible teachers that, according to the New Testament, all believers, whether old or young, whether experienced or beginners, are priests. I was glad to hear a word concerning this universal priesthood. Although I tried my best to practice the priesthood, I did not have the way to do it. When I was studying the Pentateuch with the saints in Taiwan in 1953, I began to see how we can serve God as priests. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4bvZo0yGiuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> It is possible to read through the New Testament dozens of times without finding the way to serve as a priest. But we can find the way by studying the types in the Old Testament. We should never disregard the value of the Old Testament types. Certain types are just as valuable as the plain words uttered in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL93ZfyT_8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36736" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">First Peter 2:5</span> says that we are a holy priesthood offering up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36737" data-verses="1Peter 2:9">verse 9</span> of that chapter we are described as a royal priesthood. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36738" data-verses="Revelation 1:6">Revelation 1:6</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36739" data-verses="Revelation 5:10">5:10</span> both say that we are priests. We are a royal priesthood and a holy <span class="pg" data-page-id="1486" id="1486">[1486]</span> priesthood. We are priests, and we can serve God as priests. Thus, we are neither the clergy nor the laity, but a priesthood. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_CnZl6ftZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> The clergy-laity system has its source in the Devil; it certainly is not according to the Bible. The Bible reveals that all believers are priests. But the clergy-laity system kills and nullifies the priesthood. It is our birthright to be priests serving God. But the traditional system of clergy and laity has taken away our birthright. For this reason, I say strongly that this system has its source in the Devil, not in the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQe3RNszwAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> Although the New Testament tells us that we are priests, it does not tell us how to be priests. From the New Testament we learn that we have been saved, washed with the blood of Christ, regenerated by the Spirit, and endowed with certain gifts. Thus, we know that we are saved, washed, regenerated, and gifted. But we still need further help to know how to serve God as priests. It was when I studied Old Testament typology again with the saints in 1953 that the light came from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36740" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> to reveal the way to serve as a priest. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755Ty_DLj89jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv">NOT ORDAINED OR CONSECRATED<br/>BUT SANCTIFIED</h2><p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoACsCzw6BePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36741" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> speaks of sanctifying Aaron and his sons to be priests. Hence, it does not speak of sanctifying sinners, unbelievers, or the unsaved. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36742" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Verse 1</span> says, “And this is the thing which you shall do to them to sanctify them to serve as priests to Me.” Please notice that this verse does not speak of consecrating Aaron and his sons or of ordaining them. As far as this chapter is concerned, we need to avoid the use of the word consecration and instead speak of sanctification. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyNluvKGKvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> The word “consecrate” is somewhat traditional. Under the influence of this word, we may have a mistaken concept concerning the sanctification of God’s saved ones to be His priests. Therefore, I would emphasize the fact that here we have the charge not to consecrate Aaron and his sons, but to sanctify them. The proper word to use to describe what is <span class="pg" data-page-id="1487" id="1487">[1487]</span> recorded in this chapter is “sanctify.” Aaron and his sons were sanctified to be priests serving God. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqD4gR-hhkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> There is a great difference between consecration and sanctification, and an even greater difference between sanctification and ordination. When a person is ordained, some of the clergy lay their hands upon him and pray for him. Consecration, according to common, ordinary usage, means the presenting of ourselves to God. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36743" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> describes neither ordination nor consecration; it is a record of sanctification. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDToyEyc4YBr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> Suppose instead of being sanctified according to what is described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36744" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span>, Aaron were ordained in a traditional, religious way. In such a case, others would lay their hands on him and pray for him. Aaron, however, would still be empty-handed. Both before and after his ordination, he would be the same in that he would be empty-handed. In order for him to be God’s priest and to serve Him as a priest, he must have something with which to serve God. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XkI-YWZe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> Suppose instead of being ordained Aaron were merely consecrated to the Lord, offered to Him and presented to Him. But even after being consecrated in this way, Aaron would still be empty and have nothing with which to serve God. The sanctification of Aaron and his sons to serve as priests is very different from both ordination and consecration. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9MlpplJSHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0">SANCTIFIED BY HAVING OUR HANDS FILLED</h2><p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCu9pBwbfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> According to what is revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36745" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span> of Exodus, the priests need to have their hands filled in order to serve God. Their hands should be filled with the fat of the ram of the peace offering, bread, cakes, and wafers. When a priest has his hands filled with the sweetness and riches of Christ, he is different from others. They are empty-handed, but he has his hands filled. As a result, he is sanctified, set apart, from the common people. Furthermore, he has the riches of Christ with which to serve God as a priest. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLS8HkpvpfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> The way to sanctify a saint to serve as a priest is to fill his hands with the riches of Christ. Before a believer is <span class="pg" data-page-id="1488" id="1488">[1488]</span> sanctified in this way, he is already a saint. Consider the situation with Aaron. He had experienced the Passover, he had been saved from the judgment of God, and he had been delivered from Pharaoh’s tyranny and from the usurpation of the world. Furthermore, he had crossed the Red Sea, enjoyed the heavenly food and the living water and received a divine education at Mount Sinai. He had also experienced many things in the wilderness. Truly he was a saint, one who was saved and brought out of Egypt and one who had experienced the things of God in the wilderness. This was true, of course, not only of Aaron, but of all the children of Israel as well. They had been brought out of Egypt and had come to the mountain of God to be trained by Him. Then the Lord told Moses that certain of God’s people were to be sanctified to be priests. This indicates that it is not sufficient merely to be a saint. After becoming a saint, we need to be sanctified so that we may serve as a priest to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG6huRo9_iyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> Being sanctified to serve as priests is different from enjoying Christ as the Passover or as the manna. Also it is not the same as enjoying the Spirit of Christ as the living water. This sanctification involves something in addition to all these precious experiences. This means that it is something in addition to the Passover, the manna, and the living water. As we have pointed out, it is not ordination or consecration, but the filling up of our hands with the riches of Christ. It is very important for us to see that in order to serve as priests, we need something in addition to the enjoyment of Christ as the Passover, the manna, and the living water. Oh, may we all see this! </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNH_i03O6oTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> When I saw this matter in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36746" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> years ago, I was very happy. Truly it was a great light. I have no way to express how happy I was to see the way to serve God as a priest. During the first twenty-five years of my Christian experience, I knew that we believers were priests, but I did not know how to serve God as a priest in a practical way. But from studying this chapter under the Lord’s enlightenment, I began to see the way. How happy I was! How I rejoiced in the Lord’s mercy in showing us the way to serve as priests! <span class="pg" data-page-id="1489" id="1489">[1489]</span> The way is to have additional experiences of Christ, experiences in addition to the Passover, the daily manna, and the flowing of the living water. </p>

The offering of the sin offering was a basic aspect of the sanctification of Aaron and his sons to be priests. Let us now go on to consider some other aspects. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl_3vqgcYvIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3">ONE WITH THE BURNT OFFERING</h2><p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yJ8EYXn89qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> The sanctification of Aaron and his sons to serve God as priests required two rams, in addition to the young bull for the sin offering. Concerning the first ram, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36761" data-verses="Exodus 29:15-18">29:15-18</span> says, “And you shall take one ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram. And you shall slaughter the ram, and take its blood and sprinkle it upon the altar round about. And you shall cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its inwards and its legs, and put them upon its pieces and upon its head. And you shall burn the whole ram on the altar; it is a burnt offering to Jehovah, a sweet savor; it is an offering by fire to Jehovah.” According to these verses, the first ram was slaughtered and then cut into pieces. This, no doubt, refers to Christ, who was slaughtered and cut into pieces. However, we also are involved, for we are identified with Christ. This identification with Christ is indicated by Aaron and his sons laying their hands upon the head of the ram (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36762" data-verses="Exodus 29:15">v. 15</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9IIyfAwqRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> We all treasure the matter of identification with Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1494" id="1494">[1494]</span> But have you ever realized that in Christ, with Christ, and through Christ you need to be slaughtered and also cut into pieces? Who among those who believe in Christ is willing to be slaughtered and cut into pieces? It is doubtful that anyone truly wants this. But in order to be a priest, we need to be slaughtered and cut into pieces in Christ and through Christ. We, of course, are not to slaughter ourselves or others, but God will slaughter us in Christ. The Bible indicates that whoever wants to serve God as a priest will be slaughtered and cut into pieces by Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8ZoK-JiqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> When some hear about the priests being slaughtered and cut into pieces in Christ, they may protest and say, “No, we don’t agree with this. Are not the bulls and the rams types of Christ? Christ is the One who was slaughtered. God has slaughtered Christ and cut Him into pieces. This is not something that happens to us. Regarding this, Christ is our substitute; He has replaced us in being slaughtered and cut into pieces.” If this is your concept you are qualified only to be saved; you are not qualified to be a priest. Yes, Christ was crucified as our substitute. He was our replacement in bearing our sins when He died on the cross. Nevertheless, in order to serve God as priests, we must be identified with the slaughtered and cut Christ, the Christ who was cut into pieces by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5H4XHIH4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> After the ram of the burnt offering was slaughtered and cut into pieces, its inwards and legs were washed, and then the whole ram was burned on the altar as a sweet savor to the Lord. This indicates that after the slaughtering and the cutting, we need the washing and the burning. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36763" data-verses="Exodus 29:4-5">29:4-5</span>, Aaron and his sons were washed with water and then clothed with the priestly garments. That was the initial washing. After that, the priests had to be one with the ram that was slaughtered, cut into pieces, washed, and burned. </p>

This is the reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36765" data-verses="Numbers 28:2-3">Numbers 28:2 and 3</span> speak of the burnt offering as God’s food. God’s food, the burnt offering, satisfies Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4bvZY07VCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> Certainly, Christ is the One who is burned to feed God and satisfy Him. However, we still need to lay our hands on Christ; that is, we need to be one with Him, identified with Him. This means that whatever we are and whatever we do must be slaughtered, cut in pieces, washed, and burned on the altar, the cross, entirely for God’s enjoyment and satisfaction. This will then become food for God. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL93pf6AP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> In my early years as a Christian, I did not know that God needed food, that He needed something to eat. From the Bible I had learned only that it was necessary for us sinners to eat something. I did not know that God also wanted to eat. But when I restudied typology with the saints in Taiwan in 1953, I began to see that God needs food. The first aspect of God’s food is the burnt offering. This is the reason that, of all the offerings described in the book of Leviticus, the burnt offering is mentioned first. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cyijDkmdlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> Although in Leviticus the burnt offering comes first, regarding the sanctification of the priests described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36766" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span>, the bull for the sin offering is first, and the ram for the burnt offering is second. We must first offer Christ as our sin offering; we must realize constantly that we are sinful in nature and even sin itself. By our natural birth and life, we are sin. Those who would serve God as priests must have this consciousness and understanding. Since we are sinful in nature, how can we serve God? In ourselves and in our natural life, it is impossible. We need to be redeemed, and our sinful nature must be dealt with. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzg2CJ92EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> After the first ram was slaughtered, its blood was sprinkled upon the altar round about. This blood speaks of redemption. How is it possible for us to be God’s priests? It is possible only through redemption. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1496" id="1496">[1496]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc5sAuvN1w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm">THE BLOOD AND THE FRAGRANCE</h2><p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC8yXY-H5C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> Concerning the burnt offering in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36767" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span>, we see two important matters. The first is the blood sprinkled about the altar. This is for our peace and satisfaction. The second matter is the sweet savor ascending to heaven for God’s satisfaction. The redeeming blood is sprinkled on the altar on earth, and the savor ascends to the heavens to satisfy God. As our burnt offering for our sanctification as priests, Christ shed His blood for our peace, and He Himself was burned for God’s satisfaction. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTfKAQBAX1FgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> The first ram was for a burnt offering, but the second ram was for a peace offering. The peace offering is rather complicated. The burnt offering is actually simple: it was slaughtered, cut into pieces, washed, and burned. From this offering there was a twofold issue—the blood sprinkled upon the altar and the sweet fragrance ascending to God. The blood is for us to look at, and the sweet fragrance is for God to enjoy. To be sure, the blood satisfies God, but mainly the blood is for our conscience and for our peace. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4HKO1J3Rnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> Why do we offer Christ as the first ram, the ram of the burnt offering? We offer Him in this way because we realize that we have not been for God and that we are not for God. Instead we are always for ourselves. Furthermore, instead of being God’s food, we have always been our own food. Therefore, because we are sinful, we need Christ to redeem us. He has been slaughtered for us, He has been cut into pieces for us, and His blood was shed for our redemption. Now whenever we look at the blood, we are at peace, knowing we have been redeemed. Also the sweet fragrance ascends to God for His enjoyment and satisfaction. As a result, our problem is solved, and God’s hunger is satisfied. Hence, there is a peaceful situation, and we can go on further to enjoy Christ and experience more of Him. In particular, we may now experience Him as the second ram, as the peace offering. </p>

<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbEJOdgPpHhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> According to the New Testament, the goal of God’s salvation is to make all those who believe in Christ priests of God. Therefore, if a person is saved but fails to become a priest to serve God, he cannot fulfill God’s purpose or satisfy His desire. In the last book of the New Testament, Revelation, we see that the redeemed ones are all priests of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36783" data-verses="Revelation 1:5-6">Revelation 1:5 and 6</span> we are told that Jesus Christ has loosed us from our sins by His blood and “made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father.” Likewise, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36784" data-verses="Revelation 5:10">Revelation 5:10</span> says that we have been made “to our God a kingdom and priests.” </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0WTzsJox8Wf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> From the typology in the Old Testament, we see that God first redeemed His people, then saved them, and then educated them. These three matters are revealed in the book of Exodus. First God redeemed the children of Israel, then He rescued and delivered them, and after that He educated them. While they were in Egypt, they were redeemed, and then they were rescued from Egypt. In the wilderness they enjoyed God’s provision. Eventually, they arrived at Mount Sinai, where they received a divine education. At Mount Sinai God came in to sanctify certain ones among the children of Israel to be His priests. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcOBzIAS6zJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej">A UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD</h2><p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h8DEgIc8l6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> If we consider the entire revelation of the Scripture, we shall see that it was not God’s intention to sanctify merely some of His redeemed ones to be priests. No, God’s intention <span class="pg" data-page-id="1502" id="1502">[1502]</span> was to sanctify all of His redeemed people for this purpose. This means that God intended for the whole people of Israel to be a kingdom of priests. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36785" data-verses="Exodus 19:6">Exodus 19:6</span> says, “Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.” However, due to the degradation of the people, eleven tribes fell away. Therefore, God chose one of the twelve tribes, the tribe of Levi, to be His priests. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9MlpJlJQHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> We should not think that God wants only some of His people to be sanctified as priests. On the contrary, God is sanctifying all believers in Christ to be His priests. For this reason, some Christian teachers speak of the New Testament priesthood as the universal priesthood. Because the priesthood is universal, there should not be some believers who are priests and others who are laymen. There should not be any clergy-laity system among New Testament believers. All those who believe in Christ, all the redeemed and saved ones, should be educated and sanctified to be priests of God. As revealed in the New Testament, God’s desire is that all who have been redeemed in Christ should be His priests. This is spoken of not only in Revelation, but also in 1 Peter. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36786" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">First Peter 2:5</span> says, “Ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ” (lit.). Moreover, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36787" data-verses="1Peter 2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span> says that the believers are a royal priesthood. This reveals that God’s New Testament economy is to have all His redeemed people to be His priests. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCu9JBwZfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR">A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SANCTIFICATION</h2><p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLS8nkqvJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> Although the New Testament reveals clearly that all the redeemed ones should be God’s priests, the New Testament does not provide a detailed description of how we may be priests serving God in a practical way. There is no detailed account in the New Testament of how we may actually be sanctified to serve God as priests. The New Testament tells us that God wants us to be priests, but it does not show us how to become priests. But in the Old Testament, specifically, in the book of Exodus, there is a chapter that gives such a detailed description of the sanctification of God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="1503" id="1503">[1503]</span> priests. This chapter is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36788" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span>. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36789" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span> of Exodus is precious. I can testify that I love this chapter very much. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG6hORr9fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> In order to love anything it is necessary to have a proper appreciation of that thing. For example, in my home province in China there is a mountain known for yielding crystal used in making eye glasses. Outwardly, the stones containing this crystal are rough and uncomely. But if these stones are cut open, the high quality crystal within them can be seen. Only by having the proper appreciation of these stones can we value them. In the same principle, if we would have a love for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36790" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span> of Exodus, we must first come to appreciate this chapter. I believe that if you spend adequate time in this portion of the Word, you also will come to love it. It may be that after all these messages on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36791" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span>, you will love this chapter as much as I do. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNH_C00PaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> Why is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36792" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> so precious? The preciousness of this chapter consists in its detailed description of how God’s redeemed people can be sanctified to serve Him as priests. As we have pointed out, what this chapter describes is not ordination or even just consecration, but sanctification. The first verse of this chapter says, “And this is the thing which you shall do to them to sanctify them to serve as priests to Me.” God commanded Moses to sanctify Aaron and his sons to serve as His priests. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0vwMMx6qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> Christians today are familiar with the words sanctify and sanctification. If we have a heart to seek a full sanctification in our experience, we must come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36793" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span> of Exodus. This chapter is not only on the priesthood; in particular, it is a chapter on sanctification. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBb-YHDaKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> Sanctification is an important subject in theology. It may be as great in importance as justification. Among believers there are different schools of teaching concerning sanctification. What we need is an understanding of sanctification as described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36794" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span>. In these messages I shall try to give a brief sketch of the sanctification of the priests as portrayed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36795" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span>. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1504" id="1504">[1504]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf8r_7oqQmndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr">A THOROUGH CLEANSING</h2><p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeRMrWzpNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> When Aaron and his sons were being sanctified to serve God as priests, they first had to realize that they were unclean, they were dirty, and they needed to be cleansed. It is not pleasant to realize that we are dirty and need a thorough cleansing. Physically speaking, uncleanness may come from two sources, one source from within us and the other from outside of us. On the one hand, we may come in contact with many things that cause us to become dirty. On the other hand, perspiration from within us also makes it necessary for us to bathe daily. Therefore, we become dirty, unclean, both from perspiration and from the outward touch with earthly things. In fact, it is not necessary to touch anything to get dirty, for we can be made dirty simply by what is in the atmosphere. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bROiHNEJXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> I use the matter of physical cleansing to illustrate the washing, the cleansing, that is part of the process of sanctification to serve as God’s priests. Do you intend to be a priest serving God? If this is your intention, you must realize that you are dirty and that you need to wash. This is the reason in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36796" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span> the sanctification of Aaron and his sons to be priests of God begins with washing, with cleansing. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36797" data-verses="Exodus 29:4">Exodus 29:4</span> says, “And you shall bring Aaron and his sons near unto the door of the tent of meeting, and wash them with water.” We need to wash away the uncleanness caused by perspiration and also the uncleanness which comes from the contact with the things on earth. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJpyc--9VCqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h">CLOTHED WITH PRIESTLY GARMENTS</h2><p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRE8L6gljWTX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> After Aaron and his sons had been washed with water, they needed to be clothed with priestly garments. In order to serve God as priests, they had to be properly clothed. Their priestly garments can be compared to a uniform, official clothing worn for a specific purpose. The priestly garments not only covered the nakedness of Aaron and his sons; these garments also qualified them to fill the office of priest. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36798" data-verses="Exodus 29:5-6">Exodus 29:5 and 6</span> say, “And you shall take the garments, and clothe Aaron with the tunic, and the robe of the ephod, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1505" id="1505">[1505]</span> and the ephod, and the breastplate; and you shall gird him with the band of the ephod. And you shall put the turban upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the turban.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36799" data-verses="Exodus 29:8-9">Verses 8 and 9</span> go on to say, “And you shall bring his sons near, and clothe them with tunics. And you shall gird them with a girdle, Aaron and his sons, and bind caps on them.” These verses clearly indicate that in order to serve as priests, Aaron and his sons had to be clothed with the priestly garments. </p>

And you shall slaughter the ram, and take of its blood, and put it upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the big toe of their right foot; and you shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.” Here we see that the blood of the ram was put upon the priests’ ear, thumb, and big toe. This indicates that the organs used for hearing, working, and walking all need to be cleansed. Those who would be priests of God must learn to listen to Him. Then they will be able to work and walk according to what they hear from Him. As priests, we must have ears, hands, and feet that have been cleansed by the redeeming blood. We must learn how to listen to our Master, to our God, how to do what is required to serve Him, and how to walk according to His way in serving Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDToyExM4RSr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> The greater part of the blood, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36812" data-verses="Exodus 29:20">verse 20</span>, was sprinkled upon the altar. This sprinkling of the blood no doubt implies redemption. The shedding of blood requires the death of a certain living being. Here the sprinkling of the blood indicates that a living creature, a ram, has been <span class="pg" data-page-id="1512" id="1512">[1512]</span> slain. Regarding the sprinkling of the blood and the anointing oil, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36813" data-verses="Exodus 29:21">verse 21</span> says, “And you shall take of the blood which is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with him; and he shall be holy, he and his garments, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him.” Both the blood and the anointing oil were sprinkled upon the priests’ garments. The blood implies termination and redemption, and the anointing oil implies germination, a new beginning. Whatever is terminated by the blood and redeemed by it is then germinated by the anointing oil. The priests as terminated, redeemed, and germinated ones could have a new beginning. As a result of this new beginning, they could be priests serving God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XkLuYeKO1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-">GOD’S PORTION OF THE PEACE OFFERING</h2><p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc5sDOvN3w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> Even after Aaron and his sons had been terminated, redeemed, and germinated, their hands were still empty. They had been given a new beginning, and they could now serve God. However, they had nothing with which to serve Him. We all need to be impressed with this very important matter. It was at this point that the Lord gave Moses detailed instructions concerning the second ram. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36814" data-verses="Exodus 29:22-23">Verses 22 and 23</span> say, “And you shall take from the ram the fat, and the fat tail, and the fat that covers the inwards, and the appendage of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat which is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of the filling of hand; and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer from the basket of unleavened bread which is before Jehovah.” Here we read of the inward parts, the right shoulder, and the bread, the cake, and the wafer. If we read carefully <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36815" data-verses="Exodus 29:22-28">verses 22 through 28</span>, we shall see that there were two shoulders, or thighs, the right and the left, and two breasts, the right and the left. The thighs and the breasts were four major parts of the second ram, in addition to the inward parts, used for the peace offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC8yU4-H7C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36816" data-verses="Exodus 29:24-25">Verses 24 and 25</span> say, “And you shall put the whole upon <span class="pg" data-page-id="1513" id="1513">[1513]</span> the palms of Aaron, and upon the palms of his sons; and wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah. And you shall take them from their hand, and burn them on the altar upon the burnt offering for a sweet savor before Jehovah; it is an offering by fire to Jehovah.” Now the priests had something to fill their hands, something to offer to God. These parts of the peace offering were burned on the altar as a sweet savor to the Lord. This was a further satisfaction to God. We have seen that the entire ram of the burnt offering was burned for God’s satisfaction. Now part of the peace offering is also burned for this purpose. As we shall see, this indicates that God is eating Christ, feasting on Christ, with His priests. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTfKDwBDXVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O">THE WAVE OFFERING AND THE HEAVE OFFERING</h2><p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4HJu1K3xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> Even though the priests had something to offer to God, they did not yet have anything to eat themselves. They were still hungry, still empty within. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36817" data-verses="Exodus 29:26">verse 26</span> the Lord said to Moses, “And you shall take the breast from the ram of the filling of hand which is for Aaron, and wave it as a wave offering before Jehovah; and it shall be your portion.” The word “wave” here indicates movement. This typifies Christ moving in His resurrection. In other words, the wave offering is a type of Christ in resurrection. Since the breast signifies love, the waving of the breast as a wave offering signifies the resurrected Christ in love. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9FI4CMpyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> According to the Gospels and the first part of Acts, the Christ who is now in resurrection came back to His disciples in love. His appearing to them after His resurrection was in an atmosphere of love. When the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36818" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span>, He said to them, “Peace be to you.” This word was spoken in an atmosphere of love. The resurrected Christ comes to us in love. This wave offering, the offering that typifies the resurrected Christ in love, was given to Moses as his portion. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl_0PqmPovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> Two parts of the ram of the peace offering still remain: the left breast and the left shoulder, or thigh. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36819" data-verses="Exodus 29:27-28">Verses 27 and 28</span> say, “And you shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which was <span class="pg" data-page-id="1514" id="1514">[1514]</span> waved and which was heaved up from the ram of the filling of hand, from that which is for Aaron and from that which is for his sons. And it shall be for Aaron and for his sons for an eternal statute from the sons of Israel, because it is a heave offering; and it shall be a heave offering from the sons of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, as their heave offering to Jehovah.” The heave offering signifies the exalted Christ, Christ in ascension. Thus, the wave offering signifies Christ in resurrection, and the heave offering signifies Christ in exaltation, in ascension. Furthermore, whereas the breast is a symbol of love, the shoulder is a symbol of strength, power. Christ in resurrection is with love, and Christ in ascension is with power. After He ascended to the heavens, Christ poured power upon His disciples. As their portion, the priests have the wave breast and the heave shoulder. This means that they enjoy Christ in resurrection with love and Christ in ascension with power. This is their portion for them to eat. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yJ_kYe089qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> God had something to eat, Moses had something to eat, and all the priests had something to eat. God’s portion was the right shoulder, the inward parts, the fat, the bread, the cake, and the wafer. The portion for Moses, the ministering one, was the right breast. The priests’ portion was the left breast as a wave offering and the left shoulder as a heave offering. This indicates that all these parties—God, Moses, and the priests—were involved in feasting. When there is such a feasting, there is peace, and everyone is satisfied. God is satisfied, Moses is satisfied, and all the priests are satisfied, for they all enjoy Christ, the all-inclusive One. Praise the Lord for this picture! </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9ILSfIj6RI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> If our hands are filled with Christ according to the picture in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36820" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span>, we shall be able to say, “Our hands are full of Christ, and our inward being is also full of Him.” This is the filling of hands, and this is true sanctification. </p>

The priests are qualified by having the proper clothing and food. Not only does <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36835" data-verses="Exodus 29:29-46">29:29-46</span> give us a conclusion of these chapters; it also presents a brief sketch concerning the priests’ garments and their food and also God’s food. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36836" data-verses="Exodus 29:29-42">Verses 29 through 42a</span> contain statutes concerning the holy garments of the high priest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36837" data-verses="Exodus 29:29-30">vv. 29-30</span>), the holy food for the priests (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36838" data-verses="Exodus 29:31-34">vv. 31-34</span>), and the daily offerings of the filling of hands of the priests (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36839" data-verses="Exodus 29:35-42">vv. 35-42a</span>). Thus, after the revelation regarding the garments of the priests, the food of the priests, and God’s food, Moses gives us a brief sketch of the statutes concerning the priestly garments and the food for the priests and God. We need to be impressed that these statutes are related to three matters—to the priests’ garments, to the priests’ food, and to God’s food. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeRPLW65tP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36840" data-verses="Exodus 29:42-46">verses 42b through 46</span> we have the result, the issue, of all these things. The result is that God comes to meet with the priests, to speak with them, and even to dwell among them and among all the sons of Israel. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36841" data-verses="Exodus 29:42">Verse 42</span> speaks of the door of the tent of meeting where the Lord will meet with us to speak with us. The following verses say, “And I will meet there with the sons of Israel, and it shall be <span class="pg" data-page-id="1522" id="1522">[1522]</span> sanctified by My glory. And I will sanctify the tent of meeting and the altar, and Aaron and his sons I will sanctify to serve as priests to Me. And I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel, and I will be their God. And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, Who brought them out from the land of Egypt that I might dwell in their midst; I am Jehovah their God.” According to these verses, the result of having the priestly garments, the priestly food, and the food offered to God by the priests is that God comes to meet with us, speak with us, and dwell among us. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bROhnNMZne1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> If we do not pay adequate attention to this brief sketch, we shall not be able to understand these verses. In fact, the more we read this portion of the Word, the less we shall understand it. This was my experience in reading these verses years ago. If we try to read and study this portion without a brief sketch and a knowledge of its conclusion, we shall have difficulty with these verses. It is not easy to see the real significance of these verses. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeRPLWzrNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> Suppose you receive a lengthy letter from your parents, a letter several pages long. You may find it difficult to grasp the emphasis or the central point of this letter. You may read it through carefully a number of times and still not see the main point. This is an illustration of our difficulty in understanding <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36842" data-verses="Exodus 28:1-2">Exodus 28 and 29</span>. We may read these chapters even twenty times and still may not be able to point out in a brief way what is revealed in these chapters. Of course, many can talk about these chapters according to letters in black and white. They may say, correctly, that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36843" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span> speaks of the clothing of the priests and that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36844" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span> tells us that Aaron and his sons need to be sanctified in order to serve as priests. However, how were Aaron and his sons sanctified to serve God as priests? Can you explain clearly and definitely the way they were sanctified? </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bROhnNELXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> The sanctification of Aaron and his sons to be priests involves a number of steps: the washing away of uncleanness, the covering of nakedness by the priestly garments, the dealing with the sinful nature through the sin offering, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1523" id="1523">[1523]</span> and the filling of their emptiness. First Aaron and his sons had to be washed and clothed. Then they needed to realize that they were born in sin, that they had a sinful nature, and that they needed a sin offering to solve this problem. But even after they had been cleansed and clothed and had offered the sin offering, they were still empty. They had nothing to satisfy God or themselves. Therefore, they needed not only the outward filling of their hands, but also the inward filling of their stomachs. To be sanctified they needed the four steps of washing, clothing, dealing with the sinful nature, and filling without and within. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJpyfe--Viqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> Before these messages on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36845" data-verses="Exodus 28:1-2">Exodus 28 and 29</span> were given, did you see these four steps of the sanctification of the priests? I doubt that any of us were clear about these matters. Furthermore, even after reading these messages, some still may not be able to recall these four points. Therefore, I urge you to remember the four steps necessary to sanctify Aaron and his sons to be priests of God: the washing away of uncleanness, the covering of their nakedness, the dealing with their sinful nature, and the filling of their emptiness. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRE8Iagmj2TX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO">GOD’S DESIRE TO DWELL AMONG US</h2><p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJ2iBVRcNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36846" data-verses="Exodus 29:29-46">29:29-46</span>, the conclusion of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36847" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">chapters twenty-eight</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36848" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">twenty-nine</span>. Even though we may now understand the steps in sanctifying Aaron and his sons to be priests, we may not understand how to apply these steps to the conclusion. In other words, we may not realize that these chapters have a goal. What is the goal of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36849" data-verses="Exodus 28:1-2">Exodus 28 and 29</span>? Some may think that the goal is to sanctify God’s redeemed ones to be His priests. However, this sanctification is a procedure; it is not the goal. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9aR5lOcEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> I realize that it is not easy to understand the goal of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36850" data-verses="Exodus 28:1-2">Exodus 28 and 29</span>. Not only do we find it difficult to grasp the significance of certain parts of the Bible; we have the same difficulty in reading spiritual books or even in reading a letter. Recently, I received a letter from a believer who told me how much he had been helped by <em>The Economy of God.</em> <span class="pg" data-page-id="1524" id="1524">[1524]</span> He further told me that he had devoured a number of other books put out by the Living Stream Ministry and had been nourished and helped by them. However, his letter indicated that actually he did not have the proper understanding of much of what he had read. This is an illustration of our difficulty in understanding spiritual matters. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfXF3mSwPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> For this reason, my speaking is often repetitious. We need to have certain things repeated again and again. The Bible itself is often repetitious. For instance, in the New Testament we are told repeatedly to believe in Jesus Christ. How many times does the New Testament charge us to believe in Christ? There can be no doubt that this is repeated again and again. The reason for such repetition is that we have dull, stubborn ears. We hear, yet we often do not understand. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr8675Rre4pcJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> Let me ask once again, what is the goal of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36851" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">chapters twenty-eight and twenty-nine</span> of Exodus? As we have pointed out, the goal is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36852" data-verses="Exodus 29:42-46">29:42b-46</span>. This goal is God’s coming to speak with us, to meet with us, and to dwell among us. God does not want merely to pay us a visit; He desires to dwell among us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36853" data-verses="Exodus 29:42">Verse 42</span> says that the Lord will meet with us and speak with us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36854" data-verses="Exodus 29:45-46">verses 45 and 46</span> the Lord says that He will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel. God first says that He will meet with us, then that He will speak with us, and eventually that He will dwell in our midst. This indicates that God’s dwelling among us depends on His speaking to us and on our speaking to Him. In other words, it depends on the conversation between us and God. Our speaking may keep Him away, or it may encourage Him to dwell with us. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQngYMNXNmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> In these verses God seems to be saying, “I want to dwell with you and not just visit with you for a short time. My intention is to dwell among you. Thus, I want to come to you and talk with you to see how you are and where you are. My desire is to have among you a tent of meeting. The tents in which you dwell are not the tent of meeting, but My tent, the tabernacle, is the tent of meeting. The goal of having the priestly garments, the priestly food, and even the food <span class="pg" data-page-id="1525" id="1525">[1525]</span> offered to Me is that I may meet with you and dwell among you.” </p>

<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnnacNQdGh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> We have pointed out that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36865" data-verses="Exodus 29:29-46">29:29-46</span> is a brief sketch of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36866" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">chapters twenty-eight and twenty-nine</span> of Exodus. The first aspect of this sketch consists of statutes concerning the holy garments of the high priests. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36867" data-verses="Exodus 29:29-30">Verses 29 and 30</span> say, “And the holy garments which are for Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them and to fill their hands in them. Seven days shall the son that is priest in his stead put them on, when he comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.” These verses speak only of the garments worn by the high priest, first by Aaron and then by his sons, his descendants, after him. This word was to apply to all the coming generations. It applied to Aaron, then to his son, and after that to his grandson. There could, of course, be only one high priest at a time. When Aaron died, Eleazar his son succeeded him as high priest. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH-rTaqLm2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg">ANOINTED IN THE PRIESTLY GARMENTS</h2><p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzIJOMjQ1RdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> Concerning the holy garments, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36868" data-verses="Exodus 29:29">verse 29</span> says that Aaron and his sons were to be anointed in them and to have their hands filled in them. The phrase “in them” means in the priestly garments. In order to have the anointing and the filling of hands, the high priest had to be clothed with the holy garments. In other words, if he were not properly clothed, he would not be qualified to be anointed. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAud_h6MOT0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> God cannot anoint anyone who is naked. Neither can He <span class="pg" data-page-id="1530" id="1530">[1530]</span> fill the hands of such a one. This is the reason, as we have already seen, that in the sanctification of the priests we first have the washing and then the covering of their nakedness. If we are spiritually naked in the sight of God, He will stay away from us. Anyone who was not properly clothed could never enter into the Holy of Holies to appear before God. Anyone who came into God’s dwelling place had to be fully covered. Now we see that in order for the high priest to be anointed and to have his hands filled, he had to first be clothed with the holy garments. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldRyj8-EcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> This principle also applies to us as priests in the church life today. Do you intend to serve in the church as a priest? If this is your intention, you need to be anointed and filled. However, you must be anointed and filled in the priestly garments. At this point, we need to recall that these garments typify different aspects of Christ. Hence, to be clothed with the priestly garments is to be fully covered by Christ and with Christ. Once we are covered by Christ, we are qualified to be anointed. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6dOwcLwIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> Today many Christians either neglect the Holy Spirit, or they speak of the Spirit in a strange way. This is the reason I cannot agree with today’s Pentecostalism. Many in Pentecostalism do not experience a genuine anointing, because they are not properly covered with Christ. Actually there is no need for us to pray for the baptism of the Holy Spirit. If we are covered with Christ in a proper way, the anointing is ours. It comes automatically. I can testify of this from my experience. For a period of time many years ago, I adopted the practice of speaking in tongues. But after more than a year, I fully abandoned that practice. I can testify that I have more spiritual power today than I did when I spoke in tongues. But many who claim to have the power of the Spirit actually have nothing more than a phantom. Their experience and their work are not lasting. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cBxtOVTYwWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> Not only were the high priests anointed in the holy garments, but they had to be clothed with these garments in order to have their hands filled. This indicates that we need <span class="pg" data-page-id="1531" id="1531">[1531]</span> to be covered with Christ, and then we can have our hands filled with Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUXm5uAE5AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ">WEARING THE PRIESTLY GARMENTS SEVEN DAYS</h2><p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-76azFfZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36869" data-verses="Exodus 29:30">Verse 30</span> says that the high priest who serves in Aaron’s stead must wear the holy garments seven days when he comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place. I have spent much time to understand the meaning of this verse. This verse means that whenever we touch the service of God, even if only for a day, we need to wear the priestly garments for seven days. Seven days signifies a full course of time. Therefore, when we touch the service of God, we need to wear Christ in various aspects for a full course of time. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMCPKIRi-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> Let us apply this matter of wearing Christ a full course of time in a very practical way. In particular, let us apply it to the church meetings. When we come to a meeting, perhaps on the Lord’s Day, we may have the desire to serve God as priests. However, if we would be proper priests serving God, we cannot do this simply by putting on Christ in an instant way. On the contrary, we must wear Christ as the priestly garments a full course of time. This is to live Christ day by day for seven days, that is, for a full course of time. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbEOPtgI6HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> God’s service is not merely for a day; it is for our entire Christian life. Our whole Christian life, from the time we are saved until the Lord’s coming back, is the full course of time signified by the seven days in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36870" data-verses="Exodus 29:30">verse 30</span>. Therefore, we need to wear Christ for the full course of our life on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0WUycJuisWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> Some of those reading this word may remember that on another occasion I said that, by applying the Lord’s blood to our situation, we can function in the church meetings, even if during the day we have failed the Lord, for example, by losing our temper. Yes, I did say that through the cleansing of the blood of Christ we can have a peaceful conscience to praise the Lord in the meetings. But such a service is of another category from the priestly service. If we live Christ day by day, wearing Him in His different aspects throughout the course of our Christian life, and then come to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1532" id="1532">[1532]</span> meeting to function as a priest, that is one kind of service. But if we merely apply the Lord’s blood just prior to coming to the meetings to cleanse us of our failures and weaknesses, we can serve Him, but in a category different from priestly service. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcJADIJCazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> The Lord knows what is the basis of our service in the church life. He can discern our situation. Furthermore, the experienced saints also know the basis of our service. Is the basis a life of constantly wearing Christ, a life of wearing Him a full course of time, or is it the instant wearing of Christ? Of course, it is better to wear Christ instantly than not to wear Him at all. But it is far better to wear Christ constantly. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h7C0gAMMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> Wearing Christ instantly to the Lord’s table meeting may be compared to a person quickly putting on his suit coat and necktie for a special occasion. But wearing Christ constantly can be compared to a person who wears a coat and tie all day long. In the latter case, the wearing of these clothes is part of his living. Those who wear Christ constantly and then come to the meetings of the church to serve have depth, weight, and riches. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFkvT7xNlB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36871" data-verses="Exodus 29:31-42">Exodus 29:31-42a</span> is concerned with the holy food for the priests (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36872" data-verses="Exodus 29:31-34">vv. 31-34</span>) and for the daily offerings of the filling of hands of the priests (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36873" data-verses="Exodus 29:35-42">vv. 35-42a</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36874" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span> God’s food is described first. We are first told of the burnt offering, of the right shoulder of the ram of the peace offering, and of the bread, the cake, and the wafer, all of which were burned to be God’s food. Then this chapter goes on to speak about the food of the priests. In the conclusion, however, the priest’s food is mentioned first. The reason is that the conclusion is practical. In actual practice, we need to be clothed, and then we need to be satisfied. We cannot serve God with an empty stomach. First we need to be fed. Then we shall serve God, not out of our emptiness, but out of that with which we are filled. Therefore, this part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36875" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> first takes care of the priests’ food and then takes care of God’s food. </p>

<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjM3Aqi2js7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> We have seen a clear picture of the steps by which Aaron and his sons were sanctified to serve God as priests. First they were washed, then they were clothed, and after that they were satisfied by having their emptiness filled. They were washed with water, they were clothed with the priestly garments, and they were satisfied with holy food. These three categories of things—the water, the garments, and the food, the offerings—are all types of Christ. After Aaron and his sons had been washed, clothed, and satisfied, they were ready to serve God. In other words, they were ready to minister food to Him. We may say that the priests were waiters bringing food to God and serving it to Him. They did not serve God anything other than the proper food for Him. </p>

The first three steps, being washed, being clothed, and being satisfied, took care of the need of the priests. The fourth step, ministering Christ to God as food for God’s satisfaction, was related to God’s need. To be a priest is to serve God, to minister Christ to Him for His satisfaction. Therefore, being a priest involves three steps related to the priests themselves and another step related to God’s satisfaction. This means that even after Aaron and his sons had been washed, clothed, and satisfied, they were not yet qualified to serve as priests. They still needed the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1538" id="1538">[1538]</span> offerings with which to serve God, offerings to be ministered to God as food. Only when this step had been accomplished was their sanctification completed. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5A5nHAVIFazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> As God’s people, we all have been redeemed. However, being redeemed is not sufficient to qualify us to serve God as priests. At most, redemption gives us the right and the position to be sanctified to serve God as priests. Therefore, after redemption, we need sanctification. This sanctification comprises four steps: being washed, being clothed, being satisfied, and serving God with food. In this message we shall consider the fourth and last step. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnnaMNXPmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36887" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span> of Exodus the most difficult matter to grasp is that of the priests serving God with food for His satisfaction. In contrast, it is rather easy to understand the priests being washed, clothed, and satisfied. As we have pointed out, the left breast and the left shoulder of the second ram were given to the priests as their portion for their enjoyment. Along with these parts of the second ram, the priests were also given bread from the basket which also contained bread for God’s food. Therefore, the priests could enjoy both meat and bread. This can be compared to the Lord Jesus using five loaves and two fishes to feed the multitude. In both cases the people were fed with meat and bread. The priests’ diet, therefore, was quite simple. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH-rDasZW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> When we come to ministering food to God, it is much more complicated. Because God is not simple, serving food to Him is likewise not simple. For example, it is rather easy for a mother to prepare a meal for her child. However, the preparation would be much more complicated if the governor of the state were coming to her home for dinner. She certainly could not feed him in the same way that she would feed a small child. In the same principle, feeding God is much more complicated than feeding the priests. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzIJOMzQ8DdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU">GOD’S FOOD</h2><p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAud_x6EcD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> We need to be impressed with the courses, the “dishes” served to God as His food. The first course was a bull for a sin offering. This was followed by two lambs a year old, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1539" id="1539">[1539]</span> fresh, young, vigorous, and full of strength. Then there was a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil. The quantity of oil was a fourth of a hin, that is, approximately a quart. The flour and oil were mingled to become the meal offering. Furthermore, there was “a fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36888" data-verses="Exodus 29:40">v. 40</span>). The quantity of wine was the same as that of the oil, a fourth of a hin. Here we have three items of the animal life—a bull and two lambs—and three items of the plant life—fine flour, oil, and wine. These six items may be divided into two groups: the first group consisting of the bull and the two lambs, and the second group, of the flour, the oil, and the wine. All these items were the “groceries” used in “cooking” a meal for God. In order to feed Him, we need a bull, two lambs, and flour, oil, and wine. </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw3-UBlLLMBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> Years ago, I had difficulty remembering all these items, all these groceries. I could not understand why Moses composed this section of the Word in such a puzzling way. You may need to read this chapter a number of times before all this becomes clear to you. According to this chapter, God’s food included a bull, two lambs, flour, oil, and wine. The amount of fine flour was a tenth of an ephah. An ephah equals ten omers. Therefore, a tenth of an ephah was one omer. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36889" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">Exodus 16</span>, the amount of daily manna for each person was an omer. Therefore, in quantity God’s food was one bull, two lambs, a tenth of an ephah of fine flour, and the fourth of a hin each of oil and wine. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZwNzR29KYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> The bull was for a sin offering, and the two lambs offered with the flour, the oil, and the wine were for a burnt offering. In typology, the burnt offering is God’s food. This offering is for God’s satisfaction. However, in order for God to eat the burnt offering we present to Him, we must first offer the sin offering. The sin offering is not God’s food, even though the inward parts and the fat were burned for His satisfaction. Therefore, we cannot say definitely that this offering was counted in the sight of God as food, but we do know that parts of the sin offering were for God’s satisfaction. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1540" id="1540">[1540]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneDONN7LUHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM">THE NEED FOR THE SIN OFFERING</h2><p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbouyWQBwzAoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> In a foregoing message we pointed out that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36890" data-verses="Exodus 28:1-2">Exodus 28 and 29</span>, God wants us to invite Him for dinner. However, we, the hosts, the ones who invite the Lord to dinner, are sinners. Therefore, before God can come to have dinner with us, our sinful nature must be dealt with. This is the reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36891" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> speaks not of the trespass offering, but of the sin offering. Are you clear concerning the difference between the sin offering and the trespass offering? It is important to know the difference between them. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83DuBavwSXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS">SIN AND SINS</h2><p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCkZDYvSKvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> In the New Testament the word sin is used in two ways, in the singular (sin) and in the plural (sins). The New Testament tells us that Christ died on the cross both for our sin and for our sins. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36892" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span> says, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36893" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:3">1 Corinthians 15:3</span> Paul says, “For I delivered to you, among the first things, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.” Peter also tells us that Christ died for our sins: “Who Himself carried up our sins in His body onto the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36894" data-verses="1Peter 2:24">1 Pet. 2:24</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36895" data-verses="1Peter 3:18">1 Peter 3:18</span> he goes on to say, “Because Christ also has once died concerning sins, the righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring us to God.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36896" data-verses="Hebrews 9:1">Chapter nine</span> of Hebrews speaks of both sin and sins. Referring to Christ, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36897" data-verses="Hebrews 9:26">verse 26</span> says, “He has been manifested for the putting away of sin by His sacrifice.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36898" data-verses="Hebrews 9:28">Verse 28</span> says, “So Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear to those who wait for Him a second time, apart from sin, unto salvation.” Therefore, in the New Testament, there is a distinction between sin and sins. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjM3AqiyxM7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> What is sin? Sin denotes our fallen nature. As fallen ones, our nature is sinful. In the sight of God, our nature is actually sin itself. A table made out of wood is not only wooden; it is also wood. In like manner, we are not only sinful—we are sin. We all need to realize that we are a <span class="pg" data-page-id="1541" id="1541">[1541]</span> constitution of sin. According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36899" data-verses="Romans 5:19">Romans 5:19</span>, we have been constituted sinners. Thus, sin is related to our sinful nature, to our natural being. </p>

And every day you shall offer a bull as a sin offering for propitiation; and you shall purify the altar when you make propitiation upon it; and you shall anoint it to sanctify it.” The seven days mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36904" data-verses="Exodus 29:35">verse 35</span> signify a full course of time, that is, our entire life. Every day we need to offer Christ as our sin offering. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36905" data-verses="Exodus 29:36">verse 36</span>, the bull as a sin offering was offered for propitiation. Here the emphasis is propitiation on the altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4ALO1Clhnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> The altar is purified by having propitiation made upon it. The altar, we should remember, is a dining table. Whenever we are about to serve a meal, we first clean the table. We want to remove all dirt that is there and purify the table. The sin offering purifies our dining table, the altar, and makes it clean as a place for eating. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcJAjIJAazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36906" data-verses="Exodus 29:36">Verse 36</span> says that the altar was to be anointed in order to be sanctified. In this verse nothing is said concerning the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1546" id="1546">[1546]</span> blood. But in principle the matter of sanctification through the sprinkling of the blood is revealed elsewhere in the writings of Moses. There is no question that the altar is purified by the blood. Here, however, the altar is sanctified by the anointing oil. Blood signifies the death of Christ, and oil, the anointing of the Spirit. We have the blood to purify us and the Spirit to anoint us. Again, we may use the illustration of a dining table. When we clean a dining table, we like it to be bright and shining. The blood purifies us, and the oil causes us to shine. Therefore we need both the blood to make us pure and the Spirit to cause us to shine. This is to be sanctified. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h7CUgAOMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> We need to remember that to be sanctified is to be separated and marked out. All other tables may be unclean and dull. They are dirty, and they do not shine. But there is one table—the altar—that is purified and anointed. Thus, it is clean, and it is shining. As a result, this table is different from all other tables and separate from them. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFkvz7yNFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36907" data-verses="Exodus 29:37">Verse 37</span> says, “Seven days you shall make propitiation on the altar and sanctify it, and the altar shall become most holy; all that touches the altar shall be holy.” Here we see that propitiation was to be made on the altar every day. After the altar had been sanctified, it became most holy. Anyone who touched the altar became holy. This means that the altar on which propitiation has been accomplished and which has been anointed with oil has become most holy. As such, the altar itself is able to sanctify the one who touches it. Whoever touches the altar is sanctified, and whatever is put on the altar is likewise sanctified. Therefore, anything offered on the altar is spontaneously sanctified. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_FgsTj9qck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> Every day we need to offer the sin offering. When we do this, we have a dining table that has been fully cleansed and anointed. Whatever is placed on this table will then be sanctified. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_CgYV6fsZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> Every morning we need to offer Christ as the sin offering. This will cause us to have a good morning. People often greet one another with the words “good morning.” When we speak of a good morning, we should refer not to a greeting, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1547" id="1547">[1547]</span> but to having a good morning through offering the sin offering to God. If we present Christ as the sin offering to God in the morning, we shall have a good morning, a morning of propitiation. The result will be that we shall have a good day, for that good morning will sanctify the entire day. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQewQ9szxAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> In the foregoing message we used the illustration of man inviting God to dinner. When we offer Christ as the sin offering, there will be no problem between us, those who invite God to dinner, and God, the One who is invited. Instead of problems, we shall have the redeeming blood and the anointing oil signifying propitiation and sanctification. Now there is peace between the inviting one and the invited One, and we can proceed to serve God food for His satisfaction. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755T1-zLj99jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> The matter of propitiation needs to be understood according to the background of the practice in ancient times. Especially among Jews, when two parties had a problem, there was the need of propitiation. After propitiation had been accomplished, the parties involved could eat together. Because propitiation had been made, they could be at peace. Then in peace they could enjoy a meal together. This is a picture, a type, of the relationship between us and God. Because of our sin, we have a problem with God. The source of this problem, this trouble, is Satan. He injected sin into us, and that sin has become a problem. But Christ came as the Lamb of God to take away sin. In this way He solved the problem and made propitiation. Therefore, whenever we offer Him to God as the sin offering, we may enjoy what He has done for us. In this way, because He has made propitiation with God on our behalf, we no longer have a problem with God. Instead, we have peace, and in peace we can feast with God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoACrDDw6AePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB">THE FOOD OFFERED TO GOD</h2><p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyNivfKGJvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36908" data-verses="Exodus 29:38-41">Verses 38 through 41</span> speak of offering two lambs every day as food directly for God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36909" data-verses="Exodus 29:38">Verse 38</span> says, “And this is what you shall offer upon the altar: two lambs a year old, every day continually.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36910" data-verses="Exodus 29:39">verse 39</span>, one lamb was to be offered in the morning, and the other lamb, in the evening. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1548" id="1548">[1548]</span> With each lamb there was an offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mingled with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36911" data-verses="Exodus 29:40">v. 40</span>). The lambs with the flour, the oil, and the wine were offered to God by priests who had been washed, clothed, and satisfied. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqD_hh-hikXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> At this point, let us consider the “groceries” used in preparing the food offered to God. These groceries include two lambs, an amount of flour, and a quantity of oil and wine. The lambs, of course, are of the animal kingdom; the flour, the oil, and the wine are of the vegetable kingdom. All these groceries typify aspects of Christ. Christ is our lamb, our wheat, our grapevine producing wine, and the olive tree producing oil. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDToyDzs4bAL6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> How can Christ in these four aspects become groceries to us? If we would answer this question, we need to realize that these matters were not merely objective to the Israelites. Rather, they were quite subjective to them, because they were things grown, raised, and reaped by the children of Israel. A tenth of the harvest was set aside and, during the feasts, was offered to God. Because these items were produced in such a way, they were subjective to the children of Israel. In other words, these items were the produce of their labor, a produce that belonged to the children of Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XjJOYVY-1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> God’s people in the Old Testament offered what they had produced. This indicates that the Christ we offer to God as His food should be very subjective to us. He should be our produce, what we have produced by our labor and daily experience. </p>

To live Christ is actually to grow Christ. This means that as we live Christ, He grows in us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36912" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> the Lord Jesus likens Himself to seed and us to soil. He came to sow Himself as the seed into us as the soil so that we may grow Him. This thought is richly developed in the New Testament. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36913" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span> Paul says, “You are God’s farm.” Literally, the Greek word rendered farm in <span class="pg" data-page-id="1549" id="1549">[1549]</span> this verse means cultivated soil, cultivated land. We are God’s cultivated land for growing Christ. Therefore, it is crucial that we produce Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cBxtOlTfiWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> In the foregoing messages we have seen that with the sanctification of Aaron and his sons to serve God as priests, there were four important points. Three of these points are related to the priests, and one is related to God. The three points concerning the priests are the matters of being washed, being clothed, and being satisfied. The one point related to God was that of preparing food for God and feeding Him so that He may be satisfied. The “groceries” used in preparing God’s food involved three items of the animal life—a bull and two lambs—and three of the plant life—flour, oil, and wine. As we know, flour comes from wheat, oil comes from the olive tree, and wine comes from the grapevine. </p>

Rather, the bull of the sin offering was for atonement, for propitiation. This means that it was offered for appeasement. Daily we need to raise Christ as a bull for a sin offering. This means that we need to practice every day offering Christ to God as the sin offering because our nature, our being, is sinful. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMCP6IZxO3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> When we invite others to our home for dinner, we like to have everything clean and in order. Then, with everything properly prepared, we and our guests shall be able to enjoy our food in peace. This illustrates the function of Christ as <span class="pg" data-page-id="1554" id="1554">[1554]</span> our sin offering. This sin offering, typified by the bull offered to God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36916" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span>, clears up the situation between us and God. The basic problem between us and God is that of our sin. Through the fall, sin entered into mankind, and as a result we are constituted of sin. Hence, we actually are sin. When Christ was incarnated, He came to be made sin. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36917" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">Second Corinthians 5:21</span> says that He was made sin for us. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36918" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Romans 8:3</span>, Christ, the Son of God, came in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin. Moreover, this verse reveals that when Christ was on the cross, God condemned sin in the flesh. Therefore, Christ was made sin for us, and God condemned sin in the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83DuhavySXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> In the sight of God, sin, which has its source in Satan and which has entered into man, is the element of our fallen nature and of our old self. Actually, we ourselves are sin. Christ became sin and brought the flesh of sin to the cross, where God condemned sin in the flesh. Therefore, before God, sin has been dealt with. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCkZD4vSIvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> If you read the New Testament carefully, you will see that nowhere are we told that Christ bore our sin on the cross. Rather, the New Testament tells us that Christ bore our sins. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36919" data-verses="Hebrews 9:28">Hebrews 9:28</span> says that Christ has been “once offered to bear the sins of many.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36920" data-verses="1Peter 2:24">First Peter 2:24</span> says that Christ “Himself carried up our sins in His body onto the tree.” Regarding sin, the New Testament says that it was taken away or put away. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36921" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>, John the Baptist declared, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” Speaking of Christ, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36922" data-verses="Hebrews 9:26">Hebrews 9:26</span> says, “He has been manifested for the putting away of sin by His sacrifice.” As we have already pointed out, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36923" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Romans 8:3</span> says that God has condemned sin. According to these verses, sin has been dealt with. It has been condemned, taken away, and put away. </p>

To save us in that way is not according to God’s economy. When <span class="pg" data-page-id="1555" id="1555">[1555]</span> we repented, God forgave our sins. He also came into our spirit to regenerate us with His Spirit. However, He did not eradicate the sin that is within us. Although we have been forgiven, cleansed by the precious blood of Christ, and regenerated by the Spirit, we are still in our old nature, in the old creation. On the one hand, we are a new creation and have a new nature; on the other hand, we are still in the old creation with the old nature. Therefore, we need to be reminded that in our old nature, our flesh, we are still sinful. We need to realize that we are sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8epa-JjqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> Some Christians hold on to a concept of the eradication of sin or to a doctrine of absolute holiness. Some teach that once a believer receives the baptism of the Holy Spirit, he becomes absolutely holy and can no longer sin. Such teachings are not according to the Bible. Furthermore, accepting the concept of eradication or absolute holiness has led some to excuse sinful things by calling them weaknesses or shortcomings. In some cases, those who hold onto the concept of eradication or of absolute holiness have fallen into gross sin. According to the Bible, we are a new creation in Christ, but in our fallen nature we are still in the old creation. Yes, we have eternal life, the divine nature, and the Holy Spirit. This means that God Himself is in us. Yet, we still have the old man, the old creation, and the flesh. Thus, with us there is always the possibility of falling into sin. We need to realize that we are still sinful. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5A5HHIG4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> According to the typology in the book of Exodus, every day we need to offer Christ to God as the sin offering. The seven days mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36924" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> signify a full course of time, that is, our entire Christian life. Until we have experienced transfiguration, the redemption of our body, we shall continue to need the sin offering. Daily we should remind ourselves that we are sin and that we need Christ as the sin offering to clear up the situation between us and God. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fRx128TNcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> When we apply Christ as the sin offering, the problem between us and God is solved, and we are cleansed. Because God has been appeased through Christ as the sin offering, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1556" id="1556">[1556]</span> we may be at peace. Now in an atmosphere of peace, we can serve food to God. </p>

In the morning one lamb was offered to God with the meal offering and the drink offering, and in the evening, the other lamb was offered to Him, also with the meal offering and the drink offering. Let us now go on to consider the lambs, the flour, the oil, and the wine offered to God as food. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL625f6DP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8">OBEDIENT TO GOD</h2><p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cyliTklcFAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> The lamb typifies Christ as the One who is obedient to God. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was absolutely obedient to God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36926" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">Philippians 2</span> says that He was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Christ’s death on the cross was the highest expression of His obedience. In the words of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36927" data-verses="Romans 5:18-19">Romans 5:18 and 19</span>, in the sight of God that obedience is regarded as a righteous act. The “one righteous act” is in particular ascribed to that single act of Christ in which He was obedient to God unto the death of the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzn3SJ-3kyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> As a lamb, Christ was not only obedient to God, but was also meek before man. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36928" data-verses="Isaiah 53:7">Isaiah 53:7</span> says, “He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.” According to the Bible, to be meek means not to resist or fight against what happens to you. Rather, it is to suffer attack and oppression. Meekness is a characteristic of lambs. Unlike dogs and cats that fight back, lambs do not resist. The four Gospels reveal that Christ was obedient and also meek. </p>

The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer between the evenings; and with the one lamb a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mingled with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering.” According to these verses, two lambs a year old were to be offered every day, one in the morning and the other in the evening. Along with each lamb, there was to be an offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour, a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQewRds1iwajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> In typology, or in figure, a lamb signifies Christ as the One obedient to God and meek before men. When Christ was on earth, He lived a life of obedience and meekness. The four Gospels indicate that Christ in His humanity was obedient and meek. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755T1_TLqu9jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> When some read this word about the meekness of Christ, they may wonder if Christ was meek when He took a whip of cords and drove out the moneychangers from the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36937" data-verses="John 2:15">John 2:15</span>). We need to remember that Christ is all-inclusive. As a man, He is obedient and meek. But He is also the Lord and the Master. As the Master, it was necessary for Him to chasten His people. A father may be very gentle and meek, but it is still sometimes necessary for him to discipline his children. A father should not say, “I should always be a lamb in relation to my children. Therefore, I should not <span class="pg" data-page-id="1564" id="1564">[1564]</span> discipline them.” In such a case, he would be a lamb-father. But in the Bible there is no such thing as a lamb-father. Rather, the Bible reveals that the Father must discipline, chasten, His children. Hence, the Lord’s chastening of His people in no way detracts from His meekness as a human being. </p>

In <em>The All-Inclusive Christ</em> we have pointed out in detail that wheat and barley are both types of Christ as our life supply. As the vegetable life, Christ is the One who produces life. A grain of wheat is useful in producing life and also in producing food for eating. When a grain of wheat is sown into the ground, it eventually grows and produces wheat. When the wheat is ground into flour, it becomes suitable for eating. Therefore, wheat signifies Christ as the life producer and also as the life supply. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqD_gB-hgkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> In the Gospel of John we have a revelation of Christ as the life producer and life supply. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36939" data-verses="John 6:41">John 6:41</span> the Lord Jesus said, “I am the bread that came down out of heaven.” Elsewhere in the same chapter, the Lord used five barley loaves and two fishes to feed the multitude. Moreover, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36940" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>, the Lord Jesus was a grain of wheat who fell into the ground to produce many grains: “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36941" data-verses="John 6:1">chapter six</span> of John we have the life supply, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36942" data-verses="John 12:1">chapter twelve</span>, the life producing. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDToyDyM4YAr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> When we offer Christ to God in the morning as our sin offering, we shall be brought into a clear situation with God. We shall also have a clear conscience, a liberated spirit, and an atmosphere of peace. Spontaneously, during the day Christ will be a lamb to us, and we shall live Him as this lamb. Furthermore, we shall also experience Christ as a grain of wheat. As we live Him, He will become our life <span class="pg" data-page-id="1565" id="1565">[1565]</span> supply, and He will also produce something within us that is good for eating. This is the way to grow Christ as wheat. </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XjIuYWYe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> Are you still wondering how to grow Christ as wheat? The way to grow Christ is to live Him as your life supply and as the One who produces life within you. Words are not adequate to describe this experience. But if we daily offer Christ as our sin offering, other experiences of Christ will follow automatically. By offering Christ to God as our sin offering, we indicate strongly that we mean business with God. Perhaps in the past we were somewhat negligent and did not mean business with the Lord. However, offering Christ to God as a sin offering proves that we are serious with the Lord in living Him. Previously we may have talked about living Christ, but were not seriously intending to live Him. But from the time we sincerely begin to offer Christ as a sin offering, we indicate that we mean business with the Lord. As a result of offering Christ as the sin offering, the sky is clear over us, our spirit is freed, and spontaneously Christ as the life-giving Spirit has the ground in us to move and the opportunity to energize us inwardly. Then spontaneously we live Him as a lamb and also as a grain of wheat. In this way we raise Christ as a lamb, and we grow Him as wheat. </p>

Then we shall be rich in spiritual groceries, for we shall have Christ as the bull for a sin offering, as the lamb for a burnt offering, and as the grain that produces life and supplies life. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLV8XkquJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> In the church meetings we need to forget the past religious and traditional practices. No longer should we pray in a traditional manner. Rather, our prayers need to be transformed. This means that in our prayers we should make mention of Christ as the bull for a sin offering, as the lamb for a burnt offering, and as the grain for a meal offering. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1566" id="1566">[1566]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG9h-Rr8fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> Regarding Christ as the animal life, the cattle, God requires only one bull and two lambs. However, we need to have a reserve, a flock, of Christ. If we do not have a reserve of Christ as the animal life, how shall we be able to continue offering Christ as the bull for a sin offering and as the lamb for a burnt offering? Therefore, although we cannot raise many Christs, because Christ is uniquely one, nevertheless in our experience we can raise Christ as a herd and as a flock so that we may have the reserve that will enable us to offer Him to God continually. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNA_y00MaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> Regarding the food offered to Him, God is not greedy. He does not eat without limitation. Of the cattle, the animal life, He requires only two lambs. Concerning flour, He requires only the tenth of an ephah, that is, one omer. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36943" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">Exodus 16</span>, an omer was the measure of each one’s daily portion of manna. Therefore, God actually does not require very much in quantity. We should not think that God’s eating has no limitation. On the contrary, God wants you to offer Him an omer of flour. However, you still need to have a reserve. It is not possible to grow Christ as wheat in a short period of time. For this reason, we need a reserve of both grain and flour. Even if we have a large quantity of grain, not enough of this grain may have been ground into flour. Then we shall not have the adequate amount of flour for a meal offering. We need a reserve not only of grain, but also of flour. </p>

We would find it difficult to eat bread without some kind of oil. Usually we put butter on our bread. In like manner, God’s eating of flour also requires oil. We have seen that the flour, or wheat, typifies Christ as the life supply and as the life-producing One. But what does the oil typify? The oil here typifies Christ as the anointing Spirit. Christ is the olive tree that produces the oil which typifies the life-giving Spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1567" id="1567">[1567]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLV8Hkt9JfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> We need to be deeply impressed with the significance of all the types in the Old Testament. In particular, we need to have a proper understanding of the daily offerings for the sanctification of the priests. Every day for a period of seven days there was the need of a bull for a sin offering, two lambs for burnt offerings, one offered in the morning and the other in the evening, and along with the lambs a meal offering and a drink offering. The meal offering was composed of wheat flour mingled with oil. The drink offering was made of wine produced from grapes. If we consider all these types in the light of our experience, we shall realize that their significance is wonderful. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG9huRtvPiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ">ATTITUDES TOWARD TYPOLOGY</h2><p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNA_i09c6oTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> A good number of Christian teachers, including some who are professors in seminaries and Bible schools and others who are denominational pastors, do not care much for the value of the types in the Old Testament. Many regard the Old Testament merely as history or as being related only to the children of Israel and having nothing to do with us, the New Testament believers in Christ. Thus, one kind of attitude toward the biblical types is to pay little or no attention to them. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0owsM5paQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> A second attitude is somewhat different. This is the attitude that since the Old Testament types have been fulfilled in the New Testament, there is no longer any need for us <span class="pg" data-page-id="1572" id="1572">[1572]</span> to pay attention to them. Those who hold this attitude claim that it is sufficient for us to have the New Testament and that there is no need for us to consider the Old Testament types any further. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4boZo07UCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> A third attitude toward biblical typology concerns the interpretation of types. This attitude is held by those who acknowledge that there are types and that they are worthy of attention. However, they say that it is too difficult for anyone to interpret them. Some, they claim, interpret them in one way, and others interpret them in another way. Because of these different understandings of the types, those who hold the third attitude say that it is better for us to leave them alone and not try to understand them. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL63Zf6BP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> We should not hold any of these attitudes, for none of them is acceptable. The Bible says, “For whatever was written before was written for our instruction, that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we may have hope” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36950" data-verses="Romans 15:4">Rom. 15:4</span>). This clearly indicates that what was written in the Old Testament is for us today. Furthermore in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36951" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:6">1 Corinthians 10:6</span> Paul, referring to the children of Israel in the wilderness says, “Now these things occurred as types of us.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36952" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:11">verse 11</span> of the same chapter Paul goes on to say, “Now these things happened to them as types, and were written for our admonition, unto whom the ends of the ages have come.” These verses certainly indicate that the Old Testament types are for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cyljzkmclAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> Moreover, the writer of the book of Hebrews in dealing with certain Old Testament types indicated that he did not have sufficient time to go into them further. For example, after speaking of the Holy Place with the lampstand and the table, and the Holy of Holies with the ark of the covenant, the writer of Hebrews speaks of the cherubim of glory overshadowing the propitiation cover. Then he says that concerning these things he “cannot now speak in detail” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="36953" data-verses="Hebrews 9:5">Heb. 9:5</span>). This indicates that the author had more to say concerning the types, but did not have the time adequate to say it. But in writing the book of Hebrews he established an example to help us interpret the types in the Old Testament. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1573" id="1573">[1573]</span> By reading Hebrews we find a model that will help us in our study of the Old Testament types. Since the New Testament points to the value of the types for us today, we must regard the three attitudes we have mentioned as not being scriptural. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzn2yJ93EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> Let us now go on to consider a fourth attitude, an attitude that is somewhat according to the Scriptures. However, as we shall see, this view of the types is rather limited in its correctness. This is the view that something in the Old Testament may be regarded as a type if it is explicitly identified as such in the New Testament. According to this understanding of types, if the New Testament does not indicate that a certain matter is a type, we should not consider it a type. As an example, those who hold this view of typology would refer to Paul’s word concerning Sarah and Hagar in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36954" data-verses="Galatians 4:1">Galatians 4</span>. In this chapter Paul clearly says that these two women are types of two covenants. Referring to such an example, those who hold this view would say strongly that we should not interpret anything in the Old Testament as a type and apply it to us unless the New Testament tells us that it is a type. Moreover, according to this view, unless the New Testament says so, we should not apply any particular matter in the Old Testament to Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc5rAevN2w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> However, some who hold this attitude allow for exceptional cases. The outstanding exception is that of Joseph in the book of Genesis. Many Bible teachers, including those who hold this fourth attitude toward types, admit that Joseph is a type of Christ. But in the New Testament there is not so much as a word to say that Joseph typifies Christ. Nevertheless, teachers of the Bible throughout the centuries have regarded Joseph as a type of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC81Xo-H6C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> When I was young I accepted this fourth attitude toward the Old Testament types. I also agreed that we could allow for an exceptional case such as Joseph. But later I began to wonder why there could not be many other exceptions if there could be one exception. The principle in each case would be the same. On the one hand, those who hold this fourth view set up a wall to limit the interpretation of types; <span class="pg" data-page-id="1574" id="1574">[1574]</span> on the other hand, they open one door as an exception. But why could not many other doors, even hundreds of doors, be opened? Considering this matter further over the years, I have concluded that this fourth attitude toward typology is not altogether correct. </p>

In addition to the plain words in the New Testament, we need the types, the pictures, in the Old Testament. In particular, we need to pay attention to the types of Christ presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36968" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span>. If we apply this picture of Christ to our experience, we shall enjoy more of Christ and learn how to grow Christ and produce Him so that we can offer Him to God in the church meetings. </p>

At least to some extent, this background influences the saints unconsciously or subconsciously. When they come to the meetings, many are still under the influence of the background of religion. Because of this influence, they come to the meetings merely to sit and join the congregation in singing. Others may offer a prayer or give a testimony. This, of course, is an improvement. Nevertheless, the situation of the meetings is still too much under the influence of what we inherited from traditional Christianity. We may regard this inheritance, this influence, as an old culture that we need to drop. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr867-Sbew6MJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> In these messages on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36969" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> we have been considering the sanctification of the believers to serve God as priests. This is related to the question of how to meet. What <span class="pg" data-page-id="1580" id="1580">[1580]</span> is revealed through the types in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36970" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> is absolutely different from the practice of traditional Christianity. For this reason, I urge you to lay aside your old background and take up something new according to the picture in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36971" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNA_S00OaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> Toward the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36972" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> we see the bull for the sin offering, the lambs for the burnt offering, the flour and the oil for the meal offering, and the wine for the drink offering. Daily our practice needs to match what is revealed in these types. This means that in our living we should experience Christ in all these ways. No longer should we live the Christian life in an old way. The New Testament makes clear what the Christian life is. However, the New Testament does not give us the details. The details are pictured in the Old Testament types. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36973" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> we have a picture showing that daily we need a bull, two lambs, flour, oil, and wine. Where is the sin offering in your way of living the Christian life? Where are the lambs, the fine flour, the oil, and the wine? It is possible that you do not have any of these in your daily life. The aspects of Christ are pictured in the Bible, but they are not part of your experience; they are not found in your daily life. Our way of living the Christian life may have its source in ethics, culture, religion, and the natural concept. It is not constituted of the elements portrayed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36974" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span>. We may be like Bible students studying the Old Testament who study the types in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36975" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span>, but do not live according to them. We do not make them one with our daily living. What is the purpose of the picture of the bull, the lambs, the flour, the oil, the wine? To be sure, it is not just for the composition of the Bible. It is a picture of what we should experience in our daily life. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0owcMx7qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> It is possible to be under the Lord’s ministry for years without applying in our daily life the revelation we have received. If this is our situation, we have the ministry in our listening, learning, or reading, but not in our living. Furthermore, what we have in our Christian life may be derived from tradition. Even what we gain from the Lord’s ministry may do nothing more than influence our traditional way of <span class="pg" data-page-id="1581" id="1581">[1581]</span> living the Christian life. It does not lead to a radical change, to a revolution, in our daily living. The picture in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36976" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> should bring about a radical change in our Christian life. It should cause us to no longer have our daily life in a traditional way. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBc-IHDbKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> We may illustrate what we mean by tradition from certain practices of Catholicism. According to the Catholic way, regularly a believer should go to confession and then attend mass. In addition, when she is in a church building, a woman is supposed to have a covering on her head. Also according to Catholic tradition, some may buy candles and place them in front of an image. This is the Catholic way according to tradition. Although you do not follow this kind of tradition, in principle your way of living the Christian life may also be traditional. Therefore, I hope that as we are speaking concerning how to meet and how to be priests serving the Lord, we shall apply all the matters in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36977" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> to our daily living. May all these things cause a revolution in our Christian life. In particular, we need to be revolutionized in our praying. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf8s_roqRmndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> I can testify that I am still learning how to have a proper Christian life. I admit that in the past I was strongly under the influence of tradition. We do not know how deep in tradition we are. When we try to get out of tradition, we discover that it is extremely difficult to get out. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeWM7WzqNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36978" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> the bull typifies Christ as our sin offering and the lambs typify Christ as our burnt offering. I encourage you to practice offering Christ to God as your sin offering and also as your burnt offering. I would also encourage you throughout the day to enjoy Christ as the meal offering, as the fine flour mingled with oil, and even to experience Him as the wine to be poured out to God as a drink offering. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bRJiXNEKXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2">PRAYING SPONTANEOUSLY AND INTIMATELY</h2><p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJp1cu--Uiqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> Because it is somewhat difficult to understand these matters and practice them, let me try to explain further what I mean. I do not mean that you should do anything in a <span class="pg" data-page-id="1582" id="1582">[1582]</span> legal way. The Lord is living and present, and we love Him. He is present with us, and we are present with Him. Is the Lord not living and present? And are you not also living and present? Therefore, both you and the Lord are living and present to each other. There should be some spontaneous communication between you and the Lord. As you and the Lord enjoy such a relationship, you will realize that you are still sinful, and you will offer the sin offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRE7Lqgmi2TX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> Living in the Lord’s presence will make us conscious of the fact that we are sinful, even that we are sin itself. If we do not have this feeling when in the Lord’s presence, there must be something wrong. Of course, there cannot be anything wrong with the Lord. Whatever is wrong must be on our side. But if the situation is proper, probably the first thing we shall do is to say something like this: “O Lord, I am still in the old creation, still in myself, my old nature, and in the flesh. Lord, I confess that I am sinful. Thank You, Lord, that You died for me on the cross as my sin offering. Lord, now in Your presence, I lay my hand on You and apply You as my present sin offering.” This is to take Christ as the sin offering in a spontaneous manner, not in the way of legality. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJxhxVRfNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> A spontaneous prayer in which we apply Christ as our sin offering is a true praise to the Lord. When we pray like this, we render Him the best appreciation. This kind of prayer is different from common prayer according to religious tradition or habit. The following is an example of a rather common prayer, a prayer that may be offered according to habit: “Lord, I am sinful. I thank You for Your precious blood that I can now apply to me.” This kind of prayer certainly is good, but the expression indicates that, at least to some extent, the one who prays in this way is still under the influence of tradition. However, if we apply Christ as the sin offering in the way illustrated above, that will be a sign that we are not under tradition but that we are under the Lord’s enlightenment. </p>

It is not so difficult to study the types in a doctrinal way or to understand them in a doctrinal way. But to apply these types in a practical way to our daily life as Christians requires a certain amount of experience. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83DvhamgyXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS">THE PLACE WHERE THE PRIESTLY SERVICE BEGINS</h2><p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCkZC4vaafwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> Regarding the incense altar, I would like to ask this question: Why is the incense altar revealed so late in the sequence in the book of Exodus? From reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36990" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">chapter twenty-five</span> we know that the first item in the tabernacle to be mentioned is the ark. The record then goes on to speak of the table, the lampstand, and the building of the tabernacle itself. As we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36991" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">chapters twenty-five and twenty-six</span>, we may wonder why there is no mention of the incense altar in this section. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36992" data-verses="Exodus 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> describes the bronze altar and the court of the tabernacle; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36993" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span> speaks of the priestly garments; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36994" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span> is concerned with the sanctification of the priests. Actually, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36995" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> is concerned with the priests’ food. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36996" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span> talks about the clothing of the priests, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36997" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span>, their food. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1590" id="1590">[1590]</span> It is after all this that we have the description of the golden incense altar in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36998" data-verses="Exodus 30:1-5">30:1-5</span>. Therefore, the incense altar is the last item revealed of the furniture within the tabernacle. It is described after the revelation of the tabernacle with the rest of its furniture and the equipping of the priesthood. In other words, the incense altar comes in only after the tabernacle with all the rest of its furniture has been revealed. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9CLICMoyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> We have seen that the incense altar is described after the chapter concerning the sanctification of the priests. When the priests have their clothing and their food, their hands are filled, and they are ready to serve God. By the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="36999" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span> the tabernacle with its furniture is ready, and the priesthood is also ready. Now is the time for the holy service to begin. But with what should this holy service, this priestly service, begin? Some may think that the priestly service ought to begin at the altar of burnt offering, not at the incense altar. However, according to the divine record in Exodus, this service begins at the golden incense altar, which is the second altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl43_qmOovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> With respect to the tabernacle, there are two altars: the altar of burnt offering in the outer court, the first altar, and the golden incense altar in the Holy Place, the second altar. In the sight of God, the priestly service begins at the incense altar, at the place where prayers are offered to God. I believe that it will be very helpful to our Christian life to dwell on the importance of the priestly service beginning at the incense altar. </p>

The entrance to the outer court is on the east, toward the sunrise. The altar of burnt offering and the laver were in the outer court. The tabernacle, a structure thirty cubits long, ten cubits wide, and ten cubits high, was divided into two parts: the Holy Place, measuring twenty cubits by ten cubits, and the Holy of Holies, a cube ten cubits in length, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1591" id="1591">[1591]</span> </p>

<p class="noindent" data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6dPAcLxIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> width, and height. The table was on the north side of the Holy Place, and the lampstand was on the south side. The ark, the focal point of the entire tabernacle, was in the Holy of Holies. But where was the incense altar located? It was in the Holy Place, very close to the veil separating the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cBxtPlTYxWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> Actually there is some ambiguity in the Scriptures regarding the location of the incense altar. It is difficult to say whether it was outside the veil or within the veil. Regarding the standing place of the incense altar, there is apparently a discrepancy between the mentioning of it in the Old Testament and that in the New Testament. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37000" data-verses="Exodus 30:6">Exodus 30:6</span> says that the incense altar was put “before the veil,” that is, outside the veil. This indicates clearly that the incense altar was put in the Holy Place, which was outside the veil, not in the Holy of Holies, which was within the veil. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37001" data-verses="Hebrews 9:4">Hebrews 9:4</span> says that the Holy of Holies has the incense altar. Therefore, many Christian teachers and Bible readers have thought that some error or misconstruction must somehow have occurred. But it is not so! The apparent discrepancy has a very spiritual significance according to a number of points. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUXm4eAE4AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> First, the Old Testament record of the incense altar’s standing place implies the closest relation of the incense altar to the ark of testimony, over which is the propitiation-cover, where God meets with His people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37002" data-verses="Exodus 30:6">Exo. 30:6</span>). The record even says that the incense altar is set “before the ark of the testimony,” without mentioning the separating veil that stands between them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37003" data-verses="Exodus 40:5">Exo. 40:5</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-77qzFcZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> Second, according to the American Standard Version, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37004" data-verses="1Kings 6:22">1 Kings 6:22</span> says that the incense altar “belonged to the oracle.” “Oracle” here means the speaking place of God; it denotes the Holy of Holies, in which was the ark of testimony with the propitiation-cover, where God spoke to His people. Thus, the Old Testament indicated already that the incense altar belonged to the Holy of Holies. (Though it was in the Holy Place, its function was for the ark of testimony in the Holy of Holies. On the day of atonement, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1593" id="1593">[1593]</span> both the incense altar and the propitiation-cover of the ark of testimony were sprinkled with the same blood for atonement—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37005" data-verses="Exodus 30:10">Exodus 30:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37006" data-verses="Leviticus 16:15-16">Lev. 16:15-16</span>.) Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37007" data-verses="Exodus 26:35">Exodus 26:35</span> only the table and the lampstand are mentioned as being in the Holy Place. There is no mention of the incense altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMCO6IRh-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> Third, the incense altar is related to prayer (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37008" data-verses="Luke 1:10-11">Luke 1:10-11</span>), and in Hebrews we see that to pray is to enter the Holy of Holies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37009" data-verses="Hebrews 10:19">Heb. 10:19</span>) and to come to the throne of grace, signified by the propitiation-cover over the ark of testimony in the Holy of Holies. Our prayer often begins with our mind, which is part of our soul, signified by the Holy Place. But our prayer should usher us into our spirit, signified by the Holy of Holies. Due to all these points, the writer of Hebrews had to reckon that the incense altar belongs to the Holy of Holies. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37010" data-verses="Hebrews 9:4">Hebrews 9:4</span> does not say that a golden incense altar is <em>in</em> the Holy of Holies, as the lampstand and the table are in the Holy Place in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37011" data-verses="Hebrews 9:2">verse 2</span>. It says that the Holy of Holies has a golden altar, since it belongs to the Holy of Holies. This concept fits the whole emphasis of the book of Hebrews—that we should press on from the soul (signified by the Holy Place) to the spirit (signified by the Holy of Holies). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbEOOdgL7nhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42">THE CENTER OF GOD’S ADMINISTRATION</h2><p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0WUzsJtjMWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> According to the diagram of the tabernacle and the outer court, the ark is the focus. However, in actual practice the center is the incense altar. This indicates that Christ’s interceding life is the center of the divine practice, the divine administration. In the universe there is something that may be called God’s economy, God’s administration, God’s practice. We may use different terms to describe this one matter: economy, administration, practice, dispensation, move, government. All these terms may be regarded as synonymous, as referring to the same thing. This means that God’s economy, dispensation, administration, government, move, and practice all refer to the same thing. God is not idle: He is a God of purpose. He has a purpose, and He is moving, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1594" id="1594">[1594]</span> working, acting, dispensing, administrating. This diagram of the tabernacle is a very accurate and detailed picture of God’s administration, God’s economy, in this universe. </p>

<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4boa408GiuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that the Gospel of John may be regarded as representative of the entire Bible. In this Gospel we have creation, the tabernacle, and the various items found in the outer court and in the tabernacle: the altar of burnt offering, the laver, the table, the lampstand, the ark, and the incense altar. As we have seen, the last item to be revealed of the furniture within the tabernacle, the incense altar, is the center of God’s operation in the universe. It is the heavenly White House. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL60Jf8T_8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> It is also possible to regard the book of Romans as representing the Bible as a whole. In the first few chapters of Romans we have the burnt offering altar, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37047" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> we have the ark, for this chapter is the Holy of Holies. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37048" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span>, we have the incense altar, Christ as the Intercessor. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37049" data-verses="Romans 8:34">Verse 34</span> says, “Who is he that condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died, but rather who was raised, who is even at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.” According to this verse, the One who died for our sins, who has been raised from among the dead, and who has ascended to the right hand of God in the heavens is the One who is interceding for us. Only this One can condemn us, but instead of condemning us, He is interceding for us. Hallelujah, this One will never condemn us! Now, after His death, resurrection, and ascension, He is interceding for us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cylgjkvOlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS">THE NEED FOR INTERCESSION</h2><p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzn1iJ1lUyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> If it were not for Christ’s intercession, no one would <span class="pg" data-page-id="1602" id="1602">[1602]</span> accept His death, experience His resurrection, or be one with Him in His ascension. In order for people to be motivated to experience Christ’s death, resurrection, and ascension, His intercession is necessary. Without the interceding of Christ and the church, sinners will not receive the death of Christ. Moreover, those who have received Christ’s death will not go on to experience His resurrection, much less know what it means to be with Christ in ascension, sitting with Him in the heavenlies. All these experiences are dependent on the motivation that comes from the interceding Christ and the interceding church. This is the significance of the incense altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJxiRVRdNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> The Bible first shows us the altar, the cross of Christ, and then the laver, the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit. Following this, we have Christ as the life supply, as the light, and in the Holy of Holies as the ark. Finally, in the book of Revelation, a book of God’s executing, we see that the divine administration, the divine executing, is always carried out by the incense altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9dRplOdEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> As those who are seeking the Lord, we in the recovery both individually and corporately must learn one thing—to pray. We need a praying life. The real praying life is always a life of interceding. Genuine prayer is not mainly to pray for ourselves; it is continually to pray for others. Praying for ourselves is not intercession. But to pray for others is to intercede for them. Thus, prayer for others is intercession. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfQFnmSxPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> The proper prayer life is a life of praying for others, of interceding for them. We need to pray for the churches throughout the earth and for all the saints. We need to pray for the older ones, the younger ones, and the opposers. Day by day we need to pray not mainly for ourselves, but for others. We need such an interceding life. The intercession offered at the incense altar should daily be increasing. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr867-R7e4ocJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> If we consider the diagram of the tabernacle and the outer court, we shall see that the incense altar is the center. If there were no incense altar in the tabernacle, the tabernacle would not have a center. The executing center of God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="1603" id="1603">[1603]</span> administration is not the ark; the executing center is the incense altar. It is very important that we all see this. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnnYcNXOmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> The diagram of the tabernacle and the outer court is also a diagram of our tripartite being. The outer court signifies the body; the Holy Place, the soul; and the Holy of Holies, the spirit. Where have you been today—in the outer court, in the Holy Place, or in the Holy of Holies? Some saints may have been in the outer court. When we lose our temper or when we murmur, complain, and gossip, we are in the outer court, that is, in the flesh. Anger and complaining are signs of being in the outer court, in the body. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH-pTasYW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> From reading the Life-study Messages we may be enlightened concerning the tabernacle and its furniture. However, none of the matters concerning which we have received light may be effective in our experience; it may seem that nothing works. The reason is the lack of a prayer life. If we do not have the center, the incense altar, none of the aspects of the tabernacle and the outer court will be effective in our experience. Oh, we must have a prayer life! We must have the incense altar. The prayer life motivates us to experience the altar, the laver, the table, the lampstand, and the ark. If you will pray even a little, you will find in your experience that the showbread table is precious, that the lampstand is prevailing, and that the ark is attractive. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzIJOOjQ8CdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> We may have much knowledge about the furniture in the tabernacle. We may know what is in the Holy Place and in the Holy of Holies. Nevertheless, we may not have any of these aspects of the tabernacle in our experience. Rather, we may be like a machine without a motor. Do you know what is the “motor” in our being, the motor in our body, soul, and spirit? The motor is the prayer life. Christ is not only the bread, the light, and the ark—He is also the incense altar. This means that He is the motivator and even the motor. Therefore, we need to enjoy Him as our prayer. We need to let Him pray in us, let Him guide us into prayer and into the enjoyment of Him as our prayer. I hope that we all shall see this. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAud9h6EdD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> In our experience we need to come to the altar, the laver, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1604" id="1604">[1604]</span> the table, the lampstand, and the ark. According to my study of the Bible, after we come to the ark in the Holy of Holies, we need to come back to the incense altar. The incense altar is not one item on the passageway through the tabernacle. On the contrary, it can be compared to a motor which causes everything to operate. Hence, the incense altar stands by itself as a turning point. Again and again we must come back to this turning point. This means that in order to experience any aspect of the outer court or the tabernacle, we need to pray. When we pray, everything works. When we pray, in our experience the altar, the laver, the table, the lampstand, and the ark are all effective. However, when the motor stops, everything else stops also. When the motor operates, everything else operates. This is the reason that we need to have a motor—the interceding Christ—operating within us. We need to have a prayer life, a life of prayer. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw3-UD1LLPBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw">CHRIST AS THE INTERCESSOR</h2><p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZwNxB29JYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> The incense altar signifies Christ as the Intercessor to maintain the relationship between God and His people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37050" data-verses="Romans 8:34">Rom. 8:34</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37051" data-verses="Hebrews 7:25">Heb. 7:25</span>). Without such an interceding Christ, the proper relationship between God and us could not exist. This relationship could not be maintained. Therefore, for the maintaining of our relationship with God, we need prayer not only from Christ individually, but also from His Body corporately. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneDOPd7IVnXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM">ITS MATERIALS AND DIMENSIONS</h2><p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbouyWSRwwBIUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37052" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37053" data-verses="Exodus 30:3">3</span>, the incense altar was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. The acacia wood signifies Christ’s humanity, and the gold signifies His divinity. Thus, the incense altar made with acacia wood overlaid with gold signifies that Christ’s humanity is strong in character and high in standard to express His divinity. Nothing can express God as much as an interceding life. This interceding life is based on the renewed and uplifted humanity of Christ to express God Himself. </p>

<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMCNaIRj-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> As we consider the tabernacle in Exodus, we need to be <span class="pg" data-page-id="1610" id="1610">[1610]</span> impressed that it signifies the incarnated God. God is invisible, abstract, mysterious. However, as the tabernacle, the incarnated God, this invisible, abstract, and mysterious One, becomes real, practical, and concrete. He becomes touchable and, in a very real sense, visible. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37069" data-verses="1John 1:1">1 John 1:1</span> says, “That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld, and our hands handled concerning the Word of life.” Here we see that the Apostle John touched the incarnated God.

If we had only the tabernacle without the offerings, in particular without the sin offering and the trespass offering, we would not have the means by which to come into God. The means by which we are qualified to enter into the tabernacle, into the incarnated God, is Christ as the offerings. This is the reason He says, “I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37071" data-verses="John 14:6">John 14:6</span>). Apart from Christ, we have no way to the Father. If we did not have Christ as the offerings, the tabernacle might still be present, but we would not have a way to enter into it. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h7AkgAPMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> Do you think you are qualified to enter into the tabernacle, to come into the incarnated God? We all are sinful, unclean, and full of trespasses. Because this is our condition, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1611" id="1611">[1611]</span> we are under God’s condemnation. If we tried to come into the tabernacle, we would die. What, then, is the entrance to the tabernacle? What is the way by which we may enter? The entrance, the way, is Christ as the offerings. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFktD7yMFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> Without the burnt offering altar and the offerings, we would not have a way to enter into the tabernacle. This is the reason the book of Hebrews speaks of a new way consecrated for us: “Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37072" data-verses="Hebrews 10:19-20">10:19-20</span>). The blood of the offerings shed on the altar opens the way for us to enter into the tabernacle. This was the blood shed by Christ on the cross when He was crucified as our sin offering and trespass offering. Because His blood opens the way, it becomes the means by which we are qualified to enter into God. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Fgujj9rck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> Furthermore, when we enter into the tabernacle, we should not be empty within. Rather, we have something to fill us inwardly. We not only offer the sacrifices to God, but after offering them, we may have a portion of them to eat. Thus, we have the blood outwardly and the food, the meat of the offerings, inwardly. The blood of the sacrifice without opens the way for us to enter into God, and the meat fills us inwardly. We are not hungry when we come into the tabernacle. No, we are those who have been fully satisfied. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_Cgal6fvZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M">PRAYING IN GOD AND WITH GOD IN US</h2><p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQewSNszyAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> The picture of the tabernacle portrays Christ as the incarnated God who is available for us to enter. This very Christ is also all the offerings to qualify us by opening the way into God and by filling us inwardly. As a result, we are in God, and God is in us. Therefore, by the time we come to the altar of incense, we are already in God, and God is in us. Because the incense altar is in the center of the tabernacle, which signifies the incarnated God, to be at this altar is to be in the incarnated God. Moreover, when we are in God, He is also in us. At the altar in the outer court we experience the offerings, and we have the blood to cleanse us and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1612" id="1612">[1612]</span> meat to fill us inwardly. This qualifies us to enter into the incarnated God, the One who indwells us as our food, as our life supply. Whoever comes to the incense altar is a person who is in God and who has God in him. He is one with God and mingled with Him. What a great matter this is! </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755T18DLg8djlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> Perhaps you have been a Christian for years without realizing that to pray at the incense altar is to pray in God and with God in us. However, those who pray merely in a natural way may be quite far from God, and their prayer may not have the element of God in it. Although they pray to God, they are far away from Him. When the Jews pray, they may be much closer to God than Gentiles, but they are still outside of Him. Moreover, Christians who lack enlightenment and experience or who are indifferent may have some prayer at the altar in the outer court, but they may fail to come to pray at the altar of incense in the tabernacle. Where are you when you pray? Are you at the altar in the outer court, or are you in the tabernacle, in the incarnated God? Whenever we pray, we should experientially be in God, and simultaneously, He should be in us. While we are praying to Him, we should be in Him, and He should be praying in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoACrBzw5B-PzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> Being energized through eating a healthy meal can be used to illustrate the experience of having God pray in us while we are praying in Him and to Him. Suppose there is a ministry meeting in the evening. Before the meeting I eat dinner and am energized by the food I have eaten. When I come to the meeting to speak, I am full of energy. As I am speaking, the food I have eaten for dinner is energizing me. In the same principle, when we pray in God and with God in us, He prays in us. </p>

<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcIADIOS6zJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> In the previous message we emphasized three important matters related to the incense altar. First, when we pray, we need to be in the tabernacle, which signifies the incarnated God. Second, in order to pray at the incense altar, we must first be filled and satisfied by eating the holy food, our portion of the offerings. Third, when we pray, we should offer incense to God. If we have a clear view of these matters, our prayer life will be revolutionized. Instead of being occupied in prayer with material needs or personal concerns, we shall pray for the executing of God’s purpose, for the carrying out of the divine administration, and for the dispensing of God’s supplying grace. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h6C0gGc8l6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD">PRAYER RELATED<br/>TO CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2><p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFlvT77fFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37087" data-verses="Matthew 6:33">Matthew 6:33</span> is a verse often quoted by today’s Christians: “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.” This indicates that if we seek God’s kingdom and His righteousness, whatever we need—food, clothing, housing—will be added to us. This shows that there is no need for us to be occupied in our prayer with things such as food and clothing. Instead, we should pray for God’s kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Fhszj14Mk5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> What is the kingdom of God today? God’s kingdom is the church. But what is the church? The church is Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1618" id="1618">[1618]</span> Therefore, to seek God’s kingdom is to seek Christ with the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw3-VB1LLNBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37088" data-verses="Matthew 6:33">Matthew 6:33</span> we should also seek God’s righteousness. What is God’s righteousness? God’s righteousness is Christ expressed through the church. Thus, to seek God’s kingdom and His righteousness is to seek Christ and the church. Our prayer should be related to God’s kingdom and His righteousness, that is, to Christ and the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZwMzB29LYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> What is sad is that many Christians know how to pray for a better job, a larger house, or their safety on a journey, but they do not know how to pray for Christ or the church. When some pray for the church, they do not pray directly for the church, but instead pray for business matters related to the church. We should forget about praying in such a way and pray instead for Christ and the church. When some Christians hear this word regarding their prayer life, they may say, “This word is troublesome. It seems that you are robbing me of all my prayers. After hearing this word, I don’t know how to pray. It seems that any way I try to pray is wrong.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneDPNd7LVHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM">A SERIOUS PROHIBITION</h2><p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbouyXQRwzBoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> I encourage you to read again this portion of the Word. We should burn incense upon the golden altar. However, there is a serious prohibition: we must not burn strange incense. Only the resurrected and ascended Christ is acceptable; everything else is prohibited. We should not burn strange incense, and we should not even burn at the incense altar what is acceptable to God at the offering altar. This means that we should not present the crucified and judged Christ at the incense altar. Rather, we must burn as incense the resurrected and ascended Christ. We must present such a living Christ to God as incense at the incense altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83CuRavzSXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> If some saints were to ask me to tell them how to pray, I would not do it. If I told you how to pray and you prayed accordingly, that kind of prayer would still not be Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1619" id="1619">[1619]</span> You may use the right terminology, but you may still be praying outside of God. You would not be praying in God, in the center of God’s dwelling place. Furthermore, while you are praying, you may not have the inner satisfaction or the inner energizing. This means that you do not have God praying in you as you are praying. When we pray, we need to pray in God, and we need to pray with God energizing us inwardly. Then we need to offer Christ to God and pray Him to God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCkYDIvSJvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema">A SAD SITUATION</h2><p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjM2A6ixws7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> If you were to stay with me for a period of several days, you would learn that I am a person who much of the time is not happy. The situation of today’s Christians makes me very sad. Consider the people around you and what they are doing. What do they know concerning God’s economy? How pitiful is the situation! The Lord Jesus has delayed His coming back for nearly two thousand years. Of course, to Him two thousand years are as two days. What is a long time to us is a short time to Him. From the Lord’s point of view, two hundred fifty years is like six hours, one-fourth of a day. It is Peter who says that with the Lord a thousand years are as one day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37089" data-verses="2Peter 3:8">2 Pet. 3:8</span>). In the same chapter Peter passes over the millennium and speaks directly concerning the new heavens and the new earth in eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37090" data-verses="2Peter 3:13">2 Pet. 3:13</span>). This indicates that even a thousand years is not long to the Lord. But as far as I am concerned, the Lord has delayed His coming a long time. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wJ2s23K_vl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> Who today is praying that God would dispense His grace into people? Who is praying in such a way as to motivate God’s throne of authority to judge this age? Christ has a great deal of incense, but where are the prayers that are qualified to receive the incense of Christ? Is Christ able to add His incense to your prayers? I am afraid that too few of our prayers are qualified to have Christ’s incense added to them. Therefore, it is very important for us to see that concerning our prayer life, Christ is the tabernacle, Christ is the food offered, and Christ is also the incense. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1620" id="1620">[1620]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fQxF2_StcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> According to the Bible, the two altars are linked. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37091" data-verses="Exodus 30:27-28">Exodus 30:27 and 28</span> say that both the altar of incense and the altar of burnt offering were anointed with the holy anointing oil. After the tabernacle and its utensils were anointed, the two altars were anointed. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37092" data-verses="Exodus 30:26-28">Exodus 30:26-28</span> says, “And you shall anoint with it the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the table and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense, and the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the laver and its base.” Notice that the sequence in these verses is the tabernacle, the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altar of incense, and the altar of burnt offering. Thus, the anointing connects the two altars. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vRqTtriFad_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> The anointing signifies God’s move. According to God’s move, therefore, the incense altar and the altar of burnt offering are connected. The anointing is the connecting element. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4bpY404UiuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS">By the Blood of the Sin Offering</h2><p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL72Jf5Bv8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> The altars were also connected by the blood of the sin offering offered for propitiation, or atonement, on the day of Atonement. The day of Atonement, or as we would prefer to translate it, the day of propitiation, occurred once a year. On that day the most important sin offering was offered. After the blood of this offering was shed, it was brought from the altar into the Holy Place and applied to the four corners of the incense altar. A portion of the blood was also brought into the Holy of Holies, and the remainder was poured out around the altar in the outer court. This propitiating blood also connected the two altars. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cykijkldFAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS">By the Fire That Burned the Offerings</h2><p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzm3iJ-2kyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> Furthermore, the two altars were connected by the fire that burned on the altar in the outer court. If we read the Old Testament carefully, we shall see that no strange fire <span class="pg" data-page-id="1621" id="1621">[1621]</span> was allowed to be on the incense altar for the burning of the incense. Rather, the only fire that could be used to burn the incense was the fire from the altar of burnt offering, the fire which had come down from the heavens. That fire was not strange. Any other kind of fire, however, would have been strange. The heavenly fire, the fire that came from God, that was used to burn the offerings on the altar of burnt offering was also used to burn the incense on the incense altar. By this we see that the fire that burned the offerings was also an element that linked these two altars. </p>

If we consider this type even superficially, we shall see that it is related to prayer. Both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament incense offered to God signifies our prayer to Him. Therefore, in our reading of the Bible, we can realize that the golden altar of incense must in some way be related to prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9MjoplACnJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> If we consider this matter in a deeper way, we shall see that actually the incense altar does not refer to our prayer. Rather, it refers to the prayer of Christ, for the altar itself is a type of the Person of Christ. It is not a type of Christ’s prayer. The incense altar typifies Christ the Person, not His prayer. It signifies Christ praying, Christ interceding. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCo8pB4LvVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> The individual Christ after His resurrection, and especially after His ascension, has become corporate. Thus, today before God not only is the individual Christ interceding, but the corporate Christ, the Head with the Body, is interceding as well. Christ the Head is interceding in the heavens, and the church the Body is interceding on earth. The intercessor, therefore, is not merely Christ Himself, but is Christ with His Body. If we realize this, we shall see that what is signified by the incense altar is something very deep. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1626" id="1626">[1626]</span> </p>

The first altar, the altar of burnt offering, however, was outside the tabernacle, in the outer court. The significance of the incense altar is deeper than that of the altar of burnt offering. As we have pointed out, the tabernacle signifies clearly and definitely God Himself into whom we may enter. Furthermore, since the incense altar is in the tabernacle, whoever would pray at the incense altar must be inside the tabernacle. The concept here is deep. This is the reason we say that the significance of the incense altar is profound. In this message we shall try to cover some of the details related to the depths of the significance of this altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755T0-DLj89jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> With the tabernacle and the outer court there are two altars: the altar of burnt offering and the golden altar of incense. The incense altar in the tabernacle is for prayer, and the altar of burnt offering in the outer court is for offering sacrifices. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoACqDzw6BePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> Suppose a sinner came to offer a sin offering or a trespass offering at the altar in the outer court. Would not such a person pray? Yes, he surely would pray. However, that kind of prayer, the prayer at the altar in the outer court, is shallow, for it is offered outside of God. It is not the prayer offered in God. Today many Christians know only to pray this kind of shallow prayer. They know only to pray on the basis of the blood of Christ shed on the cross. Not many believers know how to pray the kind of prayer that is offered at the incense altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyNjvvKGKvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> The primary condition or requirement for praying at the first altar is that we offer Christ as our substitute, either as the sin offering for our sin or as the trespass offering for our trespasses. This means that we pray by Him as the crucified One who shed His blood for our redemption. If our prayer goes no farther than this, we can pray to God, but we do not pray in God. To pray to God is one thing, but to pray in God <span class="pg" data-page-id="1627" id="1627">[1627]</span> is something much deeper. This is a very important matter that we all need to see. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqD-hR-hhkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> I hope that in this message we shall see something deeper, something experiential. I do not want to consider the incense altar merely in a doctrinal way. This message is not simply a Bible study on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37106" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>. Therefore, I hope that the Lord will show us something deeper related to the golden altar of incense. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDToyCzc4YBr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> When I was young, I attended the Southern Baptist Church, the Chinese Presbyterian Church, and the Brethren assembly. During the years I went to those places, I heard many prayers that concluded with the words, “through the precious blood of the Lord Jesus.” But I do not remember ever hearing a prayer ending with the words, “in the name of the Lord Jesus.” Those prayers were offered at the altar in the outer court, not at the incense altar, because those who prayed in that way were rather shallow in their prayer life. They had not entered into the deeper life or the inner life. To pray through the blood of Christ at the cross is shallow, but to pray at the incense altar is deep. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XiJ-YWZe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-">THE BLOOD AND THE FIRE</h2><p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9MjoplJSHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> The incense altar was connected to the altar of burnt offering mainly by the blood of the sin offering. First the blood of the sin offering was shed at the altar in the outer court. Then it was brought to the incense altar and sprinkled on it. The remainder of the blood was poured out at the base of the altar of burnt offering. Hence, the redeeming blood joined the two altars. This indicates that the prayer offered to God at the incense altar should be based on the experience at the first altar. Once we have experienced the first altar, we shall have the base, the standard, the ground, to come to the second altar to pray. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCo8pBwbfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> The two altars were also connected by fire. The fire that burned on the altar in the outer court was used to burn the incense at the incense altar in the tabernacle. The two altars, therefore, were connected by both the blood and the fire. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1628" id="1628">[1628]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLU9HkpvpfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> The blood signifies that our sin and trespasses have all been dealt with. Sin has been taken away, and the trespasses have been borne away. The blood gives us the assurance of this. Concerning this, there is nothing left for us to do. The blood has solved the problem of sin and of trespasses. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG8guRo9_iyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ">REDUCED TO ASHES</h2><p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNB-i03O6oTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> But what does the fire indicate? The fire indicates that whatever we are needs to be reduced to ashes. We need to be burned so that we become ashes. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0pxsMy7KQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> Certain Christians, especially those of us in the Lord’s recovery, often speak about being natural. There is only one way for us not to be natural, and that way is for us to be burned to ashes. If you have not been burned, you are still natural. Suppose you have a wooden table in front of you. That table exists in its natural state. But if the table is burned and becomes a heap of ashes, it is no longer natural. This illustrates the fact that when something is burned to ashes, it is no longer natural. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBd_4HAaqzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> I do not presume to say of myself that all believers in Christ need to become ashes. This is the Lord’s desire, not mine. When some hear that the Lord Jesus wants us to be burned to ashes, they may say, “Christ is the One who is reduced to ashes by burning. The fire at the altar burns Him; it does not burn me.” We need to remember, however, that according to typology the offerer laid his hands upon the sacrifice and thus identified himself with that sacrifice. This means that the sacrifice includes the one offering it. When Christ died on the cross, we died in Him, for we were included in Him. To say the least, when we believed in Him, we laid our hands on Him. To believe in Christ is to lay our hands on Him. Therefore, since we are one with the Christ who has been burned to ashes, we also are burned to ashes. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf8t-bopQGndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> Some may ask, “If we are burned to ashes, how shall we be able to live?” Paul gives the answer in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37107" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>: “I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” Christ’s death brings in <span class="pg" data-page-id="1629" id="1629">[1629]</span> resurrection. Now in Christ we are in resurrection, and it is no longer we who live, but Christ lives in us. However, for most Christians, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37108" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> is merely doctrine.

When we come to this altar, our unique taste, our only interest, is to pray. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bRIjXNCZne1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2">ONE WITH CHRIST IN INTERCESSION</h2><p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJp0du-3Hiqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> What kind of prayers shall we offer at the incense altar? Shall we pray private prayers or personal prayers? No, the prayer we offer at the incense altar will be intercessory prayers. Whenever we open our mouth to pray at the incense altar, the prayer that will issue forth will not be personal, individual prayer. It will be intercessory prayer. Here we no longer have any interest in ourselves or in our welfare. Instead of considering ourselves and praying for ourselves, we intercede for others. At that time we shall be in our experience a real member of Christ, a genuine part of the Body-Christ, the corporate Christ. Furthermore, that will be the time when we cooperate with Christ in His ministry of intercession. He intercedes in a particular way, and we cooperate with Him in His way of interceding. This means that we carry out His intercession in our prayers of intercession. This is marvelous! Here we are truly one with the Lord. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRE6KqguxmTX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO">THE DESTINATION OF THE DIVINE TOUR</h2><p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8fpK-JiqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> At the altar of burnt offering in the outer court there is a <span class="pg" data-page-id="1636" id="1636">[1636]</span> particular kind of depth. There are other depths at the table, the lampstand, the ark, and the incense altar. Hence, concerning the tabernacle and the outer court, there are at least five kinds of depths. In the sight of God, the reason that not many believers today are praying at the incense altar is that they have not experienced all these depths. As we have pointed out, many may pray at the first altar, but few are interceding at the second. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5B5XHIH4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> In order to pray at the second altar, we must first experience the altar of burnt offering. In our experience of this altar, we need to have a full realization concerning the blood and the ashes. Then we must go on to experience the bread on the table, the bread that signifies Christ as our life supply. After this, we proceed to the lampstand, which signifies Christ as our light. Following that, we go to the ark, which signifies Christ as God’s testimony. This testimony is versus our natural being. After we have experienced the first altar, the table, the lampstand, and the ark, we may come to the incense altar and remain there. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fQxl28SNcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> Once we arrive at the incense altar, we should stay here longer than at any other place in the outer court or the tabernacle. Here we need to pray again and again. This golden altar of incense is the destination of the divine tour. The tour begins at the altar in the outer court, passes through the table, the lampstand, and the ark, and stops at the incense altar. Because the divine tour stops here, we need to stay here to pray. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vRqTNrhF6d_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> Where are you when you pray? You may say that you are in God. However, this answer is too general. You need to specify a particular place. Where do you stay when you are in God? Do you remain at the table? Or do you remain at the lampstand or at the ark? It is very good that we spend time at the table, the lampstand, and the ark. But we should not remain at these places, because they are not our destination. Our destination is the incense altar. Because the incense altar is our destination, once we arrive there we should remain and continue there in prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4bpYY07VCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> After you have more experience, you will understand <span class="pg" data-page-id="1637" id="1637">[1637]</span> more fully what I am saying. Then according to your experience, you will say the same thing. You will declare, “After passing through the first altar, the table, the lampstand, and the ark, I am now at the incense altar interceding for God’s interests, for the churches, and for the saints.” If we remain at the incense altar, then in Christ and with Christ we shall have something that ascends to God. This is our prayer. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL72pf6AP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8">OUR PERSON REVEALED BY OUR PRAYER</h2><p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cykiDkmdlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> Our prayers represent ourselves. This is true both of the prayers at the first altar and at the second. Whatever we pray will represent us. The kind of prayer we have depends on the kind of person we are, for our prayers reveal our person. Suppose a thief offers a prayer. Certainly his prayer would indicate the kind of person he is. When the Apostle Paul prayed, he prayed in a way that represented his person. Likewise, the prayer offered to God the Father by the Lord Jesus indicates what the Lord is in His person. None of us is an exception to this principle. The way we pray reveals what we are. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzm3CJ92EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> At the first altar we cannot pray intercessory prayers. The reason we cannot pray such prayers at the first altar is that we are not yet the kind of person to offer intercessory prayers. Thus far, you have come only to the first altar. You need to experience it thoroughly and then go on to the table, the lampstand, and the ark. Not until you reach the second altar can you be the kind of person who is able to offer intercessory prayers. Reaching the incense altar indicates that we have experienced the first altar, the table, the lampstand, and the ark and have arrived at our destination. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc5qBuvN1w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm">STRANGE INCENSE</h2><p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC80WY-H5C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> When we pray at the incense altar, there will be neither strange incense nor strange fire in our prayer. If we have been enlivened by the Lord, we shall realize that many Christians pray with strange incense or with strange fire. God wants us to pray with Christ as our incense. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="1638" id="1638">[1638]</span> means that we should pray with Christ. We should not pray with strange incense. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTfMBQBAX1FgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> Do you know what strange incense is? Strange incense is anything we pray that is not Christ or that is not related to Christ. In the sight of God, that kind of prayer is strange; it is a prayer with strange incense. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4BLO1J3Rnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> When some hear that to offer strange incense is to pray something other than Christ Himself, they may ask, “Do you mean that we should not pray about our married life or family life? Are we not supposed to pray about our practical human affairs?” I do not presume to tell you what you should pray for. However, I can say that you need to ask yourself how much the things you pray for have to do with Christ. If you consider your prayer life in this way, you will find out where you are. You may realize that your prayers concerning your married life have nothing to do with Christ. Thus, those prayers are strange incense. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9DKYCPoSQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> However, I wish to make it clear that I do not mean we should not pray concerning our personal affairs or for material things that we need. My point here is that we ask ourselves how much our prayers are related to Christ. This question is a test that will reveal whether what we pray is real incense or strange incense. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl52vqlOIvIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3">STRANGE FIRE</h2><p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yP9EYd0c9qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> What is strange fire? According to typology, strange fire is any fire other than that which burns on the altar of burnt offering. The fire that burned on the altar in the outer court came down from the heavens. After coming down from the heavens, that fire burned continually on the altar. The incense must be burned by the fire from the first altar. If you burn incense by any other kind of fire, that will be strange fire. </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9OJyfLjaRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> To have strange fire is to have some kind of motive within us that is natural and that has not been dealt with by the cross. Anything that has not been dealt with by the cross and yet motivates us to pray is strange fire. If we see this, we shall realize that a great many Christians are motivated <span class="pg" data-page-id="1639" id="1639">[1639]</span> to pray by natural motives. Their motives have never been touched by the cross. The result is that they pray with strange fire. </p>

Actually, the matter of the propitiation silver is not simple. In order to see into the depths of the truth related to the propitiation silver, we need to find out the reason this item is mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37119" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> immediately after the record concerning the incense altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAuc_R6COT0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> In understanding any kind of writing we need to consider the context. If we would understand a particular paragraph, we need to know what precedes this paragraph and what follows it. We should not try to understand the paragraph merely as a unit in itself.

<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw3-VBFLCfhsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> It is not easy to understand how the incense altar and the propitiation silver are related. In a simple way we may say that the relationship between them indicates that Christ’s ministry of intercession is based upon His redemption. But even this explanation is mysterious and difficult to understand, for many things are implied by it. Therefore, we need to find out the relationship between the incense altar and the propitiation silver. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZwMzx21ZoJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ">QUESTIONS CONCERNING<br/>THE PROPITIATION SILVER</h2><p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9MjoJlJQHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> We also need to ask why, at this juncture, the children of <span class="pg" data-page-id="1642" id="1642">[1642]</span> Israel needed a ransom, or why they needed the propitiation silver. Had they not already been redeemed? Yes, they certainly had been redeemed. Their redemption had taken place nearly a year before. Not too long after the children of Israel had been redeemed by the Passover lamb, they came to Mount Sinai. It is not easy to explain why the children of Israel needed the propitiation silver in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37120" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> since they had already been redeemed. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCo8JBwZfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> Not long after I was saved, I read an article that said that the propitiation silver, the ransom silver, was a type of Christ’s redemption. This is correct; however, this understanding is superficial. The propitiation silver is related to the redemption of Christ. But why did God’s redeemed people need something further related to redemption? They had been redeemed in Egypt by the Passover lamb less than a year before. Why, after such a short time, did they need something further? </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLU9nkqvJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> The redemption of God’s people in Egypt was accomplished by the blood of the Passover lamb. The lamb was slain, and the blood was applied to the doorpost. In this way the children of Israel experienced the Passover and were redeemed. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37121" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> redemption is not related to the blood; neither is it related to anything of the animal life. Rather, in this chapter redemption is related to silver, which is a mineral. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG8gORr9fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> Christ’s life has three basic elements: the animal life, the vegetable life, and the minerals. Christ is a lamb. Here we have the element of the animal life. Christ is also wheat. Here we have the element of the vegetable life. Furthermore, Christ is the minerals, for with Him there are gold, silver, and precious stones. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNB-C00PaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> Why is the redemption in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37122" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">chapter thirty</span> not related to the blood of the animal life but rather related to silver? Some would say that the silver signifies the price paid for our redemption. According to their understanding, the silver in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37123" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> signifies the preciousness in the sight of God of the blood of Christ shed for our redemption. Christ paid a high price to redeem us—the price of His own blood. In the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1643" id="1643">[1643]</span> sight of God, this price is precious and thus it is signified by silver. However, we need to see something further. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0pxMMx6qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> Another important question related to the propitiation silver is why it is called a heave offering. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37124" data-verses="Exodus 30:13">Verse 13</span> speaks of “half a shekel as a heave offering to Jehovah.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37125" data-verses="Exodus 30:14-15">Verses 14 and 15</span> also refer to the propitiation silver as a heave offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBd_YHDaKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> I am glad to know that the Hebrew text here uses the word for heave offering. Most translations simply use the word “offering”; others use the word “contribution,” something the redeemed ones pay to God. But these versions do not indicate that the offering of the propitiation silver was a heave offering. Darby, however, was faithful, and his New Translation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37126" data-verses="Exodus 30:13">30:13</span> uses the expression “the heave-offering for Jehovah.” Furthermore, the margin of the New American Standard Version says “heave offering,” although the word “contribution” is used in the text. It is important that we have the exact translation. Otherwise, an improper translation will become a thick covering that will keep us from seeing the truth in the original text. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf8t-7oqQmndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> The propitiation silver, the price paid for our redemption, is definitely called a heave offering. Why is it called a heave offering and not a sin offering? Since this matter is related to our redemption, it seems that it should be a sin offering. We need to understand why the propitiation silver is considered a heave offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeXNrWzpNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> The Passover lamb was for all the children of Israel, both male and female, both young and old. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37127" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">chapter thirty</span> the propitiation silver is only for males twenty years old and upward. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37128" data-verses="Exodus 30:14">Exodus 30:14</span> says, “Everyone passing over unto those that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the heave offering of Jehovah.” The females and all those under the age of twenty are excluded. They have no share in this matter. Why is this propitiation silver only for males twenty years and above? This is another important question that we need to answer. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bRIjHNEJXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37129" data-verses="Exodus 38:26">Exodus 38:26</span> says concerning the propitiation silver, “A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel <span class="pg" data-page-id="1644" id="1644">[1644]</span> of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men." According to this verse, the propitiation silver was the ransom price paid for 603,550 males, aged twenty and upward. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37130" data-verses="Numbers 1:45-46">Numbers 1:45 and 46</span> we learn that this was the number of males who were able to go forth to war: “So were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel; even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.” These verses reveal that the number of the males for which the ransom price was paid was the number of those who could be soldiers to form an army. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJp0d--9VCqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> We now have five questions before us with respect to the propitiation silver. First, what is the relationship between the incense altar and the propitiation silver? Second, why did the children of Israel need something further related to redemption when they had already been redeemed in Egypt? Third, why is the propitiation silver called a heave offering? Fourth, why, after the redemption of the children of Israel by the blood of the Passover lamb in Egypt, was something related to redemption portrayed by silver at Mount Sinai, as described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37131" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">chapter thirty</span>? Fifth, why was the Passover lamb for everyone, but the propitiation silver was only for males twenty years of age and upward? If we can answer these questions, we shall have a thorough understanding of the propitiation silver. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRE6K6gljWTX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO">A MILITARY CENSUS</h2><p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJwghVSdtP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> If we take a bird’s-eye view of this item according to these five questions, we shall see that the propitiation silver was not the redemption for all the children of Israel; it was not a ransom for all the common people. Unlike the Passover lamb, it was not the ransom paid for everyone. We have emphasized the fact that in Egypt all the children of Israel, from the youngest to the oldest, both male and female, were <span class="pg" data-page-id="1645" id="1645">[1645]</span> redeemed. But concerning the propitiation silver in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37132" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">chapter thirty</span>, many were excluded. First, all the females were excluded. Furthermore, all the males under the age of twenty were excluded. The propitiation silver, therefore, was only for males twenty and above; that is, it was only for those who were able to go to war. </p>

<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8foq-OwKTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> In the previous message we began to consider the matter of the propitiation silver in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37147" data-verses="Exodus 30:11-16">30:11-16</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37148" data-verses="Exodus 30:12">Exodus 30:12</span> speaks of the sum, or the census, of the sons of Israel according to those who are numbered, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37149" data-verses="Exodus 30:16">verse 16</span> speaks of taking the propitiation silver from the sons of Israel and giving it for the service of the tent of meeting. We have pointed out that, in order to understand the significance of the propitiation silver, we need to ask several important questions. First, what is the relationship between the incense altar and the propitiation silver? Second, why did the children of Israel need the propitiation silver in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37150" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">chapter thirty</span> since they had already been redeemed? Third, why is the propitiation or ransom in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37151" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> related to silver and not to the blood of an animal, inasmuch as redemption was accomplished through the Passover lamb? Fourth, why is the propitiation silver called a heave offering? Fifth, why is the propitiation silver paid only for males twenty years of age and older and not for all the children of Israel? </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5B43HOVIFazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP">PRAYER AND THE FORMATION OF THE ARMY</h2><p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fQwF21ANcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> In answer to the first question, we have seen that the prayer, the intercession, at the incense altar is for God’s move, that God’s move requires an army that can fight for His interests, and that for the formation of His army a census is necessary. By this we can understand the relationship between the incense altar and the propitiation silver. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1652" id="1652">[1652]</span> We can understand why the propitiation silver is mentioned immediately after the description of the incense altar. The prayer at the incense altar issues in the numbering of the children of Israel for the formation of an army to fight for God’s move on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vRqStrpXqd_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> Suppose an army had not been formed among the children of Israel. Would it still have been possible for the tabernacle to move without an army? No, there would have been no way for the tabernacle to move without an army to fight for God’s interests. According to the book of Numbers, the numbering of the males aged twenty and upward was for the formation of the army. Later, the book of Numbers refers to the twelve tribes as hosts, that is, armies. This indicates that each tribe was formed into an army. The only exception was the tribe of Levi, because that tribe was the host for the tabernacle. The tribes were formed into armies for the purpose of God’s move. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc5qAOvN3w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37152" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>, immediately after the record concerning the incense altar, we have a word regarding the census and the propitiation silver. In order to have the formation of an army to fight, there was the need of a census. The intercession at the incense altar is for God’s move. But how can God move in a situation where there are so many enemies? The answer is that God moves by fighting. But where is God’s army? Where are His hosts? These hosts must be formed from God’s chosen people. Furthermore, only males who have reached the age of twenty are qualified to be part of this army. This indicates that, in order for the army to be formed, a good number of God’s chosen people need to mature. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC80X4-H7C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> In certain countries young men of a particular age are drafted into the army. However, this kind of military draft has nothing to do with redemption. A young man does not need to be redeemed in order to be drafted into military service. But the situation is altogether different with the formation of God’s army. The formation of God’s army requires redemption. Do you believe that a natural man is qualified to be in God’s army? The natural man surely is not <span class="pg" data-page-id="1653" id="1653">[1653]</span> qualified to be drafted into this army. For this reason, there is the need of the ransom silver, the propitiation silver, a further requirement in addition to the blood of the Passover lamb. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTfMAwBDXVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O">THE PASSOVER LAMB AND THE REDEMPTION SILVER</h2><p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4BKu1K3xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> There is an important difference between the Passover lamb and the propitiation silver. The Passover lamb was purely and absolutely for redemption, and it was available for all the people. But the ransom silver was related to redemption as it applied to those who were qualified to be formed into God’s army. Suppose some of God’s chosen people who were under the age of twenty wanted to put in the half-shekel of the ransom silver. Because they were under age, not yet mature enough, they would be disqualified from paying the ransom silver. However, age was not a factor in the redemption accomplished through the Passover lamb. All the children of Israel, regardless of age, were qualified to be redeemed by the lamb. Even a newborn infant was qualified to be redeemed. The matter of the difference in qualification for the redemption of the lamb and the ransom silver has been overlooked by some teachers of the Bible. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9DL4CMpyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP">THE URGENT NEED OF MATURITY</h2><p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl53PqmPovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> As God’s chosen people, we all have been redeemed, no matter what our age may be, spiritually speaking. However, we need to ask ourselves what our spiritual age is according to our maturity. Perhaps your spiritual age is only a few weeks or a few years. The total number of the children of Israel at the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37153" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> was at least two million. But less than a third, 603,550 to be exact, were qualified to be in God’s army. More than two-thirds of God’s people, all the females and the males under the age of twenty, could not be numbered in this military census. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yP8kYe089qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> The spiritual significance of this is that if we would be in the army to fight for God’s move, we need to mature. We need to grow until we come to the spiritual age of twenty. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1654" id="1654">[1654]</span> The intercession offered at the incense altar is for this growth and maturity so that the army can be formed. The more intercession there is at the incense altar, the greater will be the urgency for God’s people to grow. More and more we shall realize that the need for maturity is desperate. There is the urgent need for more of us to grow, reach maturity, and thereby become qualified to be formed into an army. Only when such an army has been formed will God be able to move on earth for His purpose. Apart from an army formed of mature ones, there is no way for God to move. Oh, God’s chosen people need to grow! The intercessory prayer offered to God at the incense altar is for this. </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9OISfIj6RI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> The sisters should not be disappointed to hear that only the males among the Israelites could be formed into God’s army. In spiritual experience a male signifies someone who is strong. Today, spiritually speaking, some sisters may be males, whereas some brothers may be females spiritually. Whether we are spiritually a male or a female does not depend on whether we are brothers or sisters; it depends on whether we are strong in spirit or weak in spirit. If you are strong in spirit, you are a male. But if you are weak in spirit, you are a female. Too many among us are females. Therefore, there is the need of maturity. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldQzj8-GcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ">FIGHTING BY THE PRECIOUS CHRIST IN ASCENSION</h2><p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6cPwcLyIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> Let us suppose that you are mature enough to be in God’s army. Because your spiritual age is at least twenty years, you are qualified to be numbered among those who are able to go to war. But does this mean that you should enter directly into the fight? It certainly does not mean this. If you try to fight directly, you will suffer a plague. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37154" data-verses="Exodus 30:12">Exodus 30:12</span> says, “When you take the sum of the sons of Israel according to those that are numbered of them, then every man shall give a ransom for his soul to Jehovah when you number them, that there be no plague among them when you number them.” In order to avoid any plague, we should never go to war in ourselves. We should say, “In myself I shall never go to fight in God’s army. Only in Christ and by <span class="pg" data-page-id="1655" id="1655">[1655]</span> Christ shall I go. I have Christ as my half-shekel, as my ransom silver. He is precious and valuable.” If we would fight in God’s army, we must fight only by this precious Christ. </p>

Furthermore, apart from the propitiation silver, there was no way for God’s dwelling place to move. The propitiation silver provided the material for the sockets, the caps, the hooks, and the fillets of the pillars.

Apparently the propitiation silver does typify the redemption of Christ. But for the initial experience of Christ’s redemption, we do not need to pay anything. However, concerning the propitiation silver in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37162" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>, all those who were numbered were required to pay a half-shekel of silver. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl53fqucYvIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> Later, among the children of Israel, this half-shekel was known as the poll tax. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37163" data-verses="Matthew 17:24-27">Matthew 17:24-27</span> refers to this. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37164" data-verses="Matthew 17:24">Verse 24</span> says, “And when they came to Capernaum, those who received the half-shekel came to Peter and said, Does not your teacher pay the half-shekel?” This half-shekel was the poll tax for God’s dwelling place in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37165" data-verses="Exodus 30:12-16">30:12-16</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37166" data-verses="Matthew 17:1">Matthew 17</span> we see that, fifteen hundred years after the book of Exodus was written, the regulation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37167" data-verses="Exodus 30:12-16">30:12-16</span> had become <span class="pg" data-page-id="1660" id="1660">[1660]</span> a statute related to the paying of the poll tax, the head tax. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37168" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">chapter thirty</span> of Exodus, the half-shekel had to be paid by every male twenty years of age and older. Surely this is more than simply a type of the redemption of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeXMLWzrNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> The payment of the half-shekel in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37169" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> was a kind of tax. In principle, it was somewhat similar to today’s income tax. This tax was used by God to accomplish two things. First, God used this tax to collect silver for the building up of the tabernacle. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37170" data-verses="Exodus 38:25-28">Exodus 38:25-28</span> we learn that the silver from this tax, the propitiation silver, was used to make the hundred sockets for the pillars of the tabernacle and also to make the caps, the hooks, and the fillets. Second, God used this tax to accomplish the formation of an army. Therefore, through the single matter of the half-shekel payment God did something for the building of the tabernacle and the formation of the army. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bRIinNELXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> The propitiation silver is related to Christ’s redemption, but it is not a direct type of redemption, for in this type there is no blood. Because there is no blood, the silver is not actually related to the death of Christ. Rather, the Christ typified by the propitiation silver is the uplifted One, the ascended One, not the crucified One. All the silver paid in by those numbered to form God’s army was regarded as a heave offering. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37171" data-verses="Exodus 30:14">Exodus 30:14</span> says, “Every one passing over unto those that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the heave offering of Jehovah.” The heave offering signifies Christ in ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJp0ce--Viqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> This heave offering was offered to God not for redemption but for a memorial. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37172" data-verses="Exodus 30:16">Verse 16</span> says, “It shall be a memorial for the sons of Israel before Jehovah to make propitiation for your souls.” A memorial is a pleasant matter.

This indicates that, spiritually speaking, we all need to grow <span class="pg" data-page-id="1661" id="1661">[1661]</span> up. If we do not grow up and reach the age of twenty, we shall not be qualified to be drafted into the army to fight for God’s move on earth. In some countries the young people may be afraid of being drafted and wish that they could stay under draft age. Because they are afraid of the military draft, they do not want to grow up. In the spiritual life many believers have their growth stunted. Although they may be rather old, it seems that they are dwarfs. They have not grown in life. We hope that among us in the Lord’s recovery there will not be any dwarfs. I hope that more and more of us will be able to say when we are asked how old we are, spiritually speaking, that we have reached the age of twenty and are qualified to pay the half-shekel. Eventually, we all should be able to say, “Praise the Lord that in the spiritual life I am no longer a teenager! I am past the age of twenty, and I am qualified to pay the half-shekel and be drafted into God’s army.” </p>

It does not typify the incarnated Christ, the crucified Christ, nor even the resurrected Christ. The propitiation silver as a heave offering is a type of the ascended Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfRG3mSwPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> In order for us to pay the half-shekel, our experience of Christ must reach the highest point, the point where we are sitting with Him in the heavenlies. This is the highest experience of Christ. We need to experience such a Christ in order to have Him as the half-shekel. In other words, the half-shekel of silver signifies the ascended Christ experienced by us and paid by us as the poll tax. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr867_Sre4pcJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> The half-shekel of silver signifies our experience of Christ as the ascended One. When we are in the meetings, we need to be in the heavens. Otherwise, we shall not be able to function. Whenever we are not with Christ in the heavens, we cannot function in the meetings. When we function properly, we are truly in the ascended Christ. </p>

The rich were not required to pay more, and the poor were not allowed to pay less. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37173" data-verses="Exodus 30:15">Verse 15</span> says, “The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when you give the heave offering of Jehovah to make propitiation for your souls.” Everyone who paid this tax was to pay the same amount, a half-shekel. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzIJPNzQ_D9BVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37174" data-verses="Exodus 30:13">30:13</span>, a shekel was twenty gerahs. A half-shekel, therefore, was ten gerahs. Furthermore, ten gerahs were equal to one bekah. A half shekel, ten gerahs, and one bekah all signify the same quantity. God required that His people pay only a half-shekel. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAuc-x6Hcj0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> When the gatherers of the poll tax came to Peter in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37175" data-verses="Matthew 17:1">Matthew 17</span>, they asked Peter if his master paid the half-shekel. Instead of going to the Lord for the answer to the question concerning the half-shekel, Peter answered that his Teacher did pay the poll tax. This indicates that Peter forgot the vision he had seen on the mount of transfiguration. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37176" data-verses="Matthew 17:5">Matthew 17:5</span> the voice out of the cloud said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight; hear Him!” The Father was telling the disciples not to listen to Moses or Elijah, who, respectively, represented the law and the prophets, but to listen to Christ, the living Son of God. It seems that the Father was saying, “Don’t care for what Moses says or for what Elijah says. Only care for what My Son says. Hear Him!” Although Peter had heard the voice out of the cloud, when he came down from the mountain he failed the test with the gatherers of the poll tax. Actually, Peter at that time did not understand what had happened on the mountain. </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw3-VAlLINhsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> Those who collected the poll tax wanted to know if the Lord Jesus paid the half-shekel according to what Moses said. If Peter had understood what he had heard on the mountain, he would have answered, “No, it is not necessary for my Teacher to pay this tax.” Because Peter was still under the influence of tradition, he answered the question with a yes. Like Peter, we are also still too much under the influence of religious tradition. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZwMyR2-L4JJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37177" data-verses="Matthew 17:25">Matthew 17:25</span> says, “And when he came into the house, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1663" id="1663">[1663]</span> Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?” The Lord was actually giving Peter a word of rebuke. The Lord seemed to be saying, “Peter, you have forgotten what you heard on the mountain. I am the Son of the One who owns the temple. I am the Son of the King. Therefore, I don’t need to pay any tax.” </p>

<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUXn4OAArQmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> In this message we shall consider the laver of bronze described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37185" data-verses="Exodus 30:17-21">30:17-21</span>. We may not realize how important the laver is. But it is crucial that we discover the significance of this item. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-676zCM5Y6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ">BRONZE, SILVER, AND GOLD</h2><p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMDOqIXxO3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> According to the record in Exodus, the laver comes immediately after the propitiation silver, and the propitiation silver comes after the incense altar. It is interesting to see that the incense altar is overlaid with gold, that the half-shekel of the propitiation money was silver, and that the laver is of bronze. Here we have three metals: gold, silver, and bronze. The silver and the bronze are for the gold. We go from bronze to silver and from silver to gold. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbEPONgBpHhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37186" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> there is no mention of iron. But in the description of the great image in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37187" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span>, we have gold, silver, bronze, iron, and clay. The image seen by Nebuchadnezzar in his dream had a head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet part of iron and part of clay (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37188" data-verses="Daniel 2:32-33">Dan. 2:32-33</span>). With God’s building, with His testimony, there are gold, silver and bronze; however, there is neither iron nor clay. The lowest of the metals in the building is bronze. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0WVz8Jmx8Wf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> We need to be impressed with the gold, the silver, and the bronze in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37189" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>. Surely these metals go together. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37190" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> first we have the incense altar overlaid with gold, then a heap of silver pieces, and then a laver made of bronze. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1668" id="1668">[1668]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldQzD8-EcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> It is easy to study the typology in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37191" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">chapter thirty</span> of Exodus, but a great deal of experience is required in order to understand it and apply it. First, we need to touch the spirit of the writer. In matters of typology this is not easy to do. Second, we need sufficient experience in order to interpret the types. Certainly the types of the bronze, silver, and gold in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37192" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> are related to one another. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6cPQcLwIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI">THE LAVER FOR THE TABERNACLE’S OPERATION</h2><p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cBxsP1TYwWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> The incense altar is for intercession, and intercession is for God’s move, God’s operation. What makes it possible for God’s testimony, the ark, and also for the entire tabernacle, God’s dwelling place, to move on earth? How can Christ as God’s testimony and the church as God’s dwelling place move on earth? The ark and the tabernacle, Christ and the church, move by means of the army. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUXn4OAE5AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> The tabernacle is God’s dwelling place. Viewed from the standpoint of a dwelling place, the tabernacle is God’s dwelling. But viewed from another perspective, the tabernacle is a camp related to an army. In the books of Exodus and Numbers we see the camps of God’s army. These camps are for fighting. The tabernacle is the central camp, and around the tabernacle the twelve tribes of Israel were formed as camps. Therefore, the twelve tribes camped around the camp of Jehovah, the tabernacle. When the children of Israel traveled, six camps went ahead of the camp of Jehovah, and six camps followed it. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-676zFfZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> The incense altar is for God’s move, and God moves by the army. But how can the army be formed? The army is formed by drafting the eligible ones. Today in different countries there is a military draft. When young men reach a certain age, they are drafted into an army. Hence, to be eligible for the draft into the army depends on growth. A little child cannot be drafted to serve in the army. Rather, a child needs to be fed, nourished, and cared for. If someone is to be drafted into the army, he must first reach the minimum age. As we have seen, the minimum age in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37193" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> was twenty. All the males twenty years of age and upward were <span class="pg" data-page-id="1669" id="1669">[1669]</span> numbered and had to pay the half-shekel of the propitiation silver. This census and payment of the propitiation silver were for God’s move. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMDOqIRi-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> The propitiation silver was also for God’s building. The one hundred sockets for the pillars of the tabernacle were made of the propitiation silver. The crowns of the pillars, the hooks, and the fillets were also made of this silver. This indicates that the propitiation silver was for the building of God’s dwelling place. The males aged twenty and upward paid the propitiation silver and were drafted to form the army to fight for God’s move. But the half-shekel paid was for God’s building. Whoever was qualified and paid the half-shekel could be in the army to fight for the move of God’s testimony on earth. Therefore, both the incense altar and the propitiation silver were for God’s move. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbEPONgI6HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> The laver is for the tabernacle’s operation. In the outer court there were the altar and the laver; in the Holy Place, the table, the lampstand, and the incense altar; and in the Holy of Holies, the ark. Without the army, the tabernacle could not move. But without the laver, nothing in the tabernacle or in the outer court could operate. For the operation of the tabernacle it was necessary for sacrifices to be offered at the altar. These sacrifices included the burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, sin offering, and trespass offering. Unless these offerings were offered to God, there would be no way for the tabernacle to operate. It was also necessary for the priests to come into the Holy Place to arrange the bread on the table and trim the lamps. It was also necessary for them to intercede at the incense altar. All this is involved in the operation of the tabernacle. Whenever the priests were to come to the altar to offer something to God or were to come into the tabernacle to serve, they first had to go to the laver to wash their hands. Unless the priests washed in the laver, there was no way for the tabernacle to operate. Without the army, the tabernacle and everything related to it would be at a standstill; it would have no way to move. But without the laver, the tabernacle would not be in operation. If the laver were removed from <span class="pg" data-page-id="1670" id="1670">[1670]</span> the outer court, everything else in the tabernacle and outer court would still be complete. However, there would not be any way for those things to operate. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0WVz8JuisWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6">OUR NEED TO BE WASHED<br/>FROM THE EARTHLY TOUCH</h2><p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcIBjIJCazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> The service of the priests in the outer court and in the tabernacle depended on their washing in the laver. No one would go several days without washing his hands. But spiritually speaking, Christians may go a very long time without washing in the laver. For example, some sisters may pray quite often both privately and in the meetings. I am concerned about their service of prayer. Sisters, before you pray, do you wash your hands in the laver? Do you have a spiritual washing before you enter into the service of prayer? Some may reply, “We confess our sins, trespasses, failures, and shortcomings. Is this not a kind of washing?” Yes, to confess our sins to the Lord is to experience one kind of washing. However, this is the washing by the blood, not the washing by the water in the laver. In order to wash away our sin, sins, trespasses, and transgressions, we need the blood. We also need the blood to wash us of our mistakes, failures, defects, defeats, and shortcomings. We need the blood to cleanse us of all these things because they are sinful. However, when the Lord Jesus washed His disciples’ feet, He used water. That kind of washing did not require blood. The feet of the disciples were dirty and needed to be washed with water. The problem was not one of sin, but of dirt, of defilement. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h6DUgAMMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> If we tell a lie or lose our temper, we commit a trespass. But if we become defiled through the earthly touch, we have not committed anything sinful. We should not try to use the blood to cleanse away that kind of dirt. For example, hands that are dirty from touching the floor need to be washed with water. Likewise, if we become defiled because of the earthly touch, we need to be washed by the water in the laver. </p>

This oil is a compound of four spices blended with oil. The first thing we need to see is the position of this ointment in the divine record in Exodus. We need to find out why it is revealed at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37211" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">chapter thirty</span>. If we understand the position of the ointment, then we shall know the relationship between it and the tabernacle. </p>

Eventually, the children of Israel made a great exodus from that condition of slavery, crossed the Red Sea, came into the wilderness, and enjoyed God’s provision. Even while they were in Egypt, they enjoyed the Passover. They also experienced God’s mighty salvation, for God delivered them out of Egypt and rescued them from the strong hand of Pharaoh and his army. In the wilderness God’s people tasted the heavenly food, the manna, and also drank living water out of the cleft rock. By God’s mercy they experienced many miracles. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqD-gx-pyUXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> The children of Israel were brought to Mount Sinai, where they stayed for probably ten months or more. At Mount Sinai they received the revelation from God that He wanted them to build a tabernacle for Him to have a dwelling place on earth. Furthermore, through this tabernacle God could have the best communion, the best fellowship, with His people. Therefore, at Mount Sinai God gave Moses the heavenly design of the tabernacle. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1680" id="1680">[1680]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnmbsNXPmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> Beginning with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37212" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">chapter twenty-five</span> of Exodus, we have a detailed description of the tabernacle and all its furniture and utensils. This record is completed at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37213" data-verses="Exodus 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span>. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37214" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span> the divine revelation comes to the matter of the priests. First we have a record of the clothing of the priests. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37215" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span> God reveals what kind of food the priests should eat. This chapter shows how the priests are sanctified and filled with the riches of the things required by God. Therefore, by the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37216" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">Exodus 29</span> the priests are ready. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH_qjasZW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37217" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">chapter thirty</span> we first have the incense altar and then the census for the divine draft to form God’s army. In foregoing messages we have pointed out why the draft for the formation of God’s army follows the description of the incense altar. The reason is that the incense altar is the motivating factor for God’s move, and God’s move requires an army. The army must fight for God’s move so that the way is clear for God to go on. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzIJPNTQ8DdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37218" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> we also have the laver, which was not far from the entrance of the tabernacle. Before entering the tabernacle to serve God, the priests had to wash their hands and feet in the laver. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAuc-R6EcD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> Following the description of the laver, we have the record concerning the holy anointing oil, the compound ointment. This ointment sanctified the priests, the tabernacle, and all the furniture and utensils. In other words, there was the need for the tabernacle, the furniture, the utensils, and also the priests to be anointed with this oil. Before the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37219" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">chapter thirty</span>, the time was not right for God to speak of the anointing oil. Now we can understand why the record of the anointing oil is found toward the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37220" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">chapter thirty</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw3-VAFLLMBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> God’s revelation is progressive. It proceeds step by step and even section by section. In Egypt the children of Israel enjoyed the Passover lamb. In the wilderness they enjoyed the manna and the water from the rock. </p>

A number of hymns have been <span class="pg" data-page-id="1681" id="1681">[1681]</span> written on the Passover, the manna, and the living water. However, many Christians have never read a book or listened to a message on the compound ointment. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbouyXRhwzAoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> Recently I looked into what others had to say regarding the compound ointment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37221" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>. In his <em>Synopsis</em> J. N. Darby has only a short word on the ointment and the incense. In his notes on the Pentateuch, C. H. Mackintosh says that in the holy anointing oil “we discern a type of the varied graces of the Holy Ghost, which were found, in all their divine fullness, in Christ.” But he does not tell us what these graces are. The writing of C. A. Coates on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37222" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> shows a great improvement. With respect to the ointment, he uses the term the Spirit of Christ many times. Few writers use this expression; most speak of the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, or even the Holy Ghost. Furthermore, Coates speaks of “the Spirit of the Man of God’s pleasure” and also of “the Spirit of another Man—even of the Man who is at God’s right hand.” This indicates that Coates saw that the Spirit of Christ is not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of another Man. Concerning the four spices, Coates says that they “represent all those features of grace which were so perfectly blended and harmonized in the Spirit of Christ.” Coates realized something concerning the blending of the spices with the olive oil. Four kinds of spices were compounded with the olive oil to make the ointment. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83CvhavwSXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> The anointing oil in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37223" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> certainly signifies one of the deeper truths in the Bible. I am concerned that some among us have not yet realized much concerning this deeper truth. Therefore, we need to know the significance of the compound ointment. </p>

This ointment signifies God, who is triune, after a long process becoming the all-inclusive compound Spirit to reach His chosen and redeemed people to be one with them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1682" id="1682">[1682]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wJ2tG3J-Pl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> It certainly was good for the children of Israel to enjoy the Passover, the manna from heaven, and the water from the rock. But none of these enjoyments can compare with the enjoyment of the anointing oil. The anointing oil signifies that now the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—can reach His chosen and regenerated people to be one with them. This is much more than the Savior or the Redeemer typified by the lamb. It is also much more than the manna and the living water. This ointment typifies the Triune God—the very God in His divine Trinity—after a long process becoming the all-inclusive compound Spirit to reach us, to make us one with Him, and to make Himself one with us. How marvelous! </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8foa-KiKTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> For centuries this wonderful matter of the compound ointment has been neglected by Christians. This is the reason there are not any hymns on this subject. However, it is easy to find hymns on the Passover. For example, one well-known hymn says, “When I see the blood, I will pass over you.” A number of hymns have been written about manna, and some deeper Christians have written hymns on the living water. But where can you find a hymn on the compound ointment? </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5B4HHLHYFazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> When certain Christians hear us speak about the compound ointment, they may say, “What are you talking about? What is this—the Triune God after a long process becoming the all-inclusive compound Spirit? Can God the Spirit be compounded? And what do you mean by this Spirit reaching us? We know that on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost came upon the believers. But the Father remained on the throne with the Son beside Him. What is this you are saying about the Triune God reaching us to be one with us?” Who knows these things today? And who talks about them? </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fQw12_TtcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> Over the years, I have been burdened to speak again and again concerning the compound Spirit. Repetition of important matters is a principle in the Bible. In the Scriptures certain things are repeated again and again. For example, consider how many times in the New Testament we hear about believing in the Lord Jesus. Why does God repeat this so much? He repeats it because it is extremely important. Likewise, because the compound Spirit is so crucial, I cannot <span class="pg" data-page-id="1683" id="1683">[1683]</span> avoid speaking about it repeatedly. Furthermore, I am concerned about the influence of today’s religious atmosphere. Due to this influence, many believers care only for superficial things. They may know about the Lamb, the heavenly manna, or even a little about the living water. But when it comes to a message on the compound ointment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37225" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>, few Christians have any ear. They like messages that tickle their ear, but they do not want to hear things that are deep and weighty. </p>

<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf8t8LoiD2ndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> The materials of the holy anointing oil are of two categories and are five in number. The first category includes the four spices: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. The second category consists of one item—olive oil. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcICDIJAazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej">Flowing Myrrh</h2><p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h6A0gAOMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> Flowing myrrh, smelling sweet but tasting bitter, signifies the precious death of Christ. In the Bible myrrh is used mostly for burial. Hence, myrrh is related to death. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37236" data-verses="John 19:1">John 19</span>, when Nicodemus and others were preparing to bury the body of the Lord Jesus, they used myrrh. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFltT7yNFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> Myrrh comes from an aromatic tree. This tree drops its juice either as a result of being cut or through some kind of natural opening or incision. In ancient times, this juice was used to reduce the suffering of death. When the Lord Jesus was being crucified, He was offered wine mixed with myrrh to reduce His pain. However, He refused to take it. No doubt, the myrrh in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37237" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> is a symbol of the Lord’s death. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Fhuzj9qck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> The aromatic liquid of myrrh not only reduces pain, but also can be used for healing the body when it gives off the wrong kind of secretion. Myrrh can correct this condition in <span class="pg" data-page-id="1688" id="1688">[1688]</span> the human body. In our human life there are many wrong secretions, but the Lord’s death on the cross corrects this problem. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_Cha16fsZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M">Fragrant Cinnamon</h2><p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQexSdszxAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> Fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ’s death. Cinnamon not only has a distinctive flavor, but it can also be used to stimulate the heart. Cinnamon may be prescribed to stimulate a weak heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755T08TLj99jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> Myrrh signifies the precious death of Christ, and cinnamon signifies the effectiveness of His death. If we apply the Lord’s death to our situation, it will reduce our pain, correct the wrong secretions, and eventually stimulate us and make us happy and joyful. I can testify of this from my experience. There are times that negative things in my environment would cause me to be low. But when I apply the Lord’s death, I am corrected, adjusted, stimulated, and stirred up. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoACqBjw6AePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB">Fragrant Calamus</h2><p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyNjt_KGJvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> The calamus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37238" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> is a reed. The Hebrew root of the word myrrh means flowing, and the root for calamus means standing up. Calamus grows in a marsh or muddy place. But even though it grows in a marsh, it is able to shoot up into the air. According to the sequence of the spices, this calamus signifies the rising up of the Lord Jesus from the place of death. The Lord was put into a marsh, into a death situation, but in resurrection He rose up and stood up. Calamus, therefore, signifies the precious resurrection of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqD-jB-hikXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR">Cassia</h2><p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDToyCxM4bAL6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> The fourth spice, cassia, signifies the power of Christ’s resurrection. Cassia and cinnamon belong to the same family. Cinnamon is from the inner part of the bark, and cassia, from the outer part of the bark. Both cinnamon and cassia are sweet and fragrant. Furthermore, the plants from which they are derived often live and grow in places where other plants cannot grow. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1689" id="1689">[1689]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XiLuYVY-1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> In ancient times cassia was used as a repellent to drive away insects and snakes. Cassia thus signifies the power, the effectiveness, of Christ’s resurrection. Christ’s resurrection can withstand any kind of environment, and His resurrection certainly is a repellent. It repels all evil “insects” and especially the old serpent, the Devil. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9Mjq5lKQnJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> Myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia are all of one category of materials, the category of the spices. Now we come to the olive oil, the only item in the second category. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCo-5BzZ_Vgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR">Olive Oil</h2><p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLU_XkpupfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> In the Bible olive oil signifies the Spirit of God. Olive oil is produced by the pressing of olives. The olive oil signifies the Spirit of God, through the pressure of Christ’s death, flowing out. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG8i-Ro8_iyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> The olive oil is the base of the ointment; it is the basic element compounded with the spices. The four spices are compounded into the olive oil to make the ointment. This indicates that the Spirit of God, signified by the olive oil, is no longer merely oil, but now it is oil compounded with certain ingredients. Regarding this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37239" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span> says, “But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” This means that before the Lord’s glorification, the compound Spirit was not yet. It was after Christ’s resurrection that the compounding, or the blending, of such a Spirit was completed. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNB8y03P6oTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB">The Four Spices<br/>Signifying Humanity in God’s Creation,<br/>and the Oil Signifying Divinity in the Godhead</h2><p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0pz8My6KQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> The four spices signify humanity in God’s creation. In the Bible the number four signifies God’s creation. We have the four living creatures and the four corners of the earth. Furthermore, the four spices themselves are elements of God’s creation. These spices signify the humanity of the Lord Jesus. In His incarnation the Lord Jesus was both God and man. The four spices signify the humanity of the Lord Jesus in God’s creation. Of course, some Christians do not like to hear <span class="pg" data-page-id="1690" id="1690">[1690]</span> the word creation used in the case of the Lord Jesus. This is due to the heretical teaching of Arius who taught that Christ was merely a created being, and that He was not the eternal God. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBd9oHAZqzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> The oil signifies divinity in the Godhead. We have seen that the number four signifies the creatures. The number one signifies God, the unique Creator. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf8t8LopTGndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> In this compound ointment we have the numbers four and one, with the number four blended with the number one. This signifies humanity blended, mingled, with divinity. Concerning the compound ointment, we cannot avoid using the word “mingled.” The words “compounded” and “blended” actually mean mingled. The four spices were mingled with the oil. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeXPbWxrNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> The mingling of the spices with the oil can be compared to the mingling of fine flour and oil in the meal offering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37240" data-verses="Leviticus 2:1">Lev. 2</span>). For the meal offering, the dough is produced by blending, mingling, fine flour with oil. This also signifies that in the one Person of Christ we have both divinity and humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bRIh3NGLXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> I have read some books which say that the Gospel of John was written in an attempt to reconcile the different parties who were debating concerning the Person of Christ. Some said that Christ was God, and others that He was merely a man. Others said that Christ was not God, but was the Word, the Logos, created by God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37241" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” This makes it clear that the Word, which is Christ, is God. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37242" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> says, “The Word became flesh.” The very Word who is God became flesh. Actually, I do not like to use the words “conciliate” or “reconcile” with respect to John’s writings. The writings of the apostle John actually are not conciliatory; rather, they are all-inclusive. Christ is the all-inclusive One. If He were only God and not man, or were merely man and not God, He would not be all-inclusive. Praise the Lord that Christ is God as well as man, man as well as God! Because Christ is all-inclusive, the writings of John are also all-inclusive. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJp0fO-8Viqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> The compound ointment likewise is all-inclusive. Can you see the all-inclusiveness of this compound? In this all-inclusive compound we have olive oil, myrrh, cinnamon, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1691" id="1691">[1691]</span> calamus, and cassia. This indicates that in the compound Spirit typified by the ointment we can see divinity, humanity, the all-inclusive death of Christ, and the effectiveness of Christ’s death. Furthermore, we can see the precious resurrection of Christ and the power of His resurrection. All these elements are included in the Spirit of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRE6IKgkj2TX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> As used in the New Testament, the Spirit of Christ is an all-inclusive expression. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37243" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">Philippians 1:19</span> speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. However, there is no reference to the bountiful supply of the Spirit of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37244" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> we read about the Spirit of God. But in the Epistles of Paul we have the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of Jesus Christ as well. </p>

I often heard about the Passover lamb and the manna, and I heard a few messages about the living water. However, I did not hear anything concerning the compound Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnmYMNedGh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> The children of Israel stayed at Mount Sinai to receive the law and the ordinances and then to receive the revelation of the tabernacle. Some teachers pointed out that the law was given as God’s test of His people. God did not intend that the children of Israel would keep the law. But because of their ignorance, it was necessary for Him to give it to them. Therefore, God tested the children of Israel by giving them the law. Immediately after the decree of the law, God gave Moses the revelation of the tabernacle. These teachers pointed out that this revelation is a matter of grace. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37264" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span> says, “For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.” Jesus Christ is the reality of the tabernacle. When this tabernacle came, grace came. Some teachers had light concerning this; however, their experience was limited. Because they were short of experience, they could not properly understand the compound ointment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37265" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH_pDakLm2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> Experience is not necessary simply to teach the tabernacle doctrinally as a type of Christ. As long as we have objective light, we can teach this type in a doctrinal way. But to <span class="pg" data-page-id="1700" id="1700">[1700]</span> touch the real significance of the compound ointment in our teaching requires spiritual experience. Because the teachers were lacking in experience, they did not know the compound ointment. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83CsBavySXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> Bible teachers have pointed out that the oil in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37266" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>, as elsewhere in the Old Testament, typifies the Spirit of God. Some have even taught that the oil poured by Jacob on the stone in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37267" data-verses="Genesis 28:1">Genesis 28</span> signifies the Spirit poured upon God’s chosen people. But although these teachers of the Bible have seen the significance of the oil, they have not seen the significance of the ointment. </p>

However, in itself, oil is not a compound, but rather a single element without any other ingredients. The ointment was a compound formed by blending four spices with olive oil. This compound ointment can be compared to paint. Paint is a compound containing more than one element. The same is true of the holy anointing oil in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37269" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wJ2um3K-vl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> C. A. Coates has much to say concerning the Spirit in his writing on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37270" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>. He devotes nearly three pages to the ointment and the incense. In this section of his writing he uses the terms the Spirit of Christ or the Spirit twenty-one times. He does not speak of the Spirit as the Holy Spirit or as the Spirit of God. Once he speaks of the Spirit of the Man of God’s pleasure. He indicates that the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of the Man of God’s pleasure. Coates also speaks of the Spirit of another Man, even the Man sitting on the right hand of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8fr6-JjqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> C. A. Coates says that the four spices “represent all those features of grace which were so perfectly blended and harmonized in the Spirit of Christ.” This indicates that Coates realized something concerning the blending of the spices with the olive oil. However, he does not say what are the features of grace that are blended in the Spirit of Christ. Regarding this, he did not have light. He did not see that myrrh signifies the all-inclusive death of Christ and that cinnamon signifies the effectiveness of Christ’s death. Furthermore, he did not see that calamus, rising up out of a muddy situation and <span class="pg" data-page-id="1701" id="1701">[1701]</span> shooting into the air, is a symbol of Christ’s resurrection, and that cassia, a substance that repels insects and snakes, typifies the power of Christ’s resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5B7nHIG4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> The sequence of the four spices is significant: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. Furthermore, here we can see three complete units of five hundred shekels. There were five hundred shekels of myrrh and five hundred shekels of cassia. Here we have two complete units. But there were two hundred fifty shekels each of cinnamon and calamus. Together these half units make another complete unit. It is significant that it is the second unit that is split into two parts. This is at least an indication that the Second of the Trinity was split into two parts on the cross. Therefore, with the ingredients of the holy anointing oil and the measurements, we have symbols of the death and resurrection of Christ. Moreover, in the spices we also see the effectiveness of Christ’s death and the power of His resurrection. </p>

The Spirit of God was present in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37272" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, and the Holy Spirit was involved with the birth of Christ. Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit. But, as Andrew Murray makes clear in the fifth chapter of <em>The Spirit of Christ,</em> the term “the Holy Spirit” is not used in the Old Testament. The Holy Spirit is first mentioned at the beginning of the New Testament when Christ was conceived. For Christ to be conceived of the Holy Spirit means that His humanity, as part of God’s creation, is holy. The conceiving Spirit in Greek is called the Spirit, the Holy. But although the Holy Spirit was present at the conception of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit was not yet until Christ was resurrected, glorified. It was then that the compounding of the Spirit was completed. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4bpao07WCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> In the writings of John, the term the Holy Spirit is seldom used. However, especially in the book of Revelation, John often speaks of the Spirit. “He who has an ear, let him hear <span class="pg" data-page-id="1702" id="1702">[1702]</span> what the Spirit says to the churches” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37273" data-verses="Revelation 2:7">Rev. 2:7</span>). This statement is repeated throughout <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37274" data-verses="Revelation 2:1">chapters two</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37275" data-verses="Revelation 3:1">three</span>. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37276" data-verses="Revelation 14:13">Revelation 14:13</span> says, “Yes, says the Spirit...” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37277" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">Revelation 22:17</span> says, “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!” </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL70Zf6DP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> In his first Epistle, John emphasizes the anointing. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37278" data-verses="1John 2:20">First John 2:20</span> says, “And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37279" data-verses="1John 2:27">1 John 2:27</span> he says, “The anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.” No doubt, when John was writing these verses, he had in mind the picture of the holy anointing oil in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37280" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cykgzklcFAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> Do you know what the anointing is? The anointing is the moving, the “painting,” of the compound Spirit. We all have this anointing, this painting, within us. Furthermore, the anointing we have received teaches us. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzm1yJ-3kyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> We worship the Lord that, over the years, He has made us clear concerning the compound Spirit. In the past, many Christians experienced only the Passover, the manna, and, at most, the living water. Their Christian experience did not come to the point of partaking of the compound Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc5qDevO3Q9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm">THE TABERNACLE AND THE PRIESTHOOD</h2><p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC80Uo-E7i81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> Why have so many Christians failed to experience the compound ointment? The reason is that this Spirit is for the building up of a spiritual house and for the holy priesthood. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37281" data-verses="1Peter 2:1">1 Peter 2</span> we have the spiritual house and also the holy priesthood. Likewise, in the book of Exodus, we have the tabernacle and the priesthood. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37282" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">chapters twenty-five through twenty-seven</span> the tabernacle is revealed. This corresponds to the spiritual house in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37283" data-verses="1Peter 2:1">1 Peter 2</span>. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37284" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">chapters twenty-eight and twenty-nine</span> we have the priesthood. Therefore, at Mount Sinai two things were made ready—the tabernacle and the priesthood. After the revelation of the tabernacle and the priesthood, we have the description of the compound ointment. This indicates that the ointment is for God’s dwelling place and for the priesthood. </p>

<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83BuRaogyXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> The holy anointing oil described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37314" data-verses="Exodus 30:23-30">30:23-30</span> is a compound ointment. In the Scriptures the Spirit of God is first typified by oil. This oil is one element, one entity, without any compounding, mingling, or blending. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37315" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> the oil is compounded with four kinds of spices: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. These four spices, precious and fragrant, were blended, mingled, compounded, with the oil. As a result, the oil becomes a compound ointment. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCkbDIvUafwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> According to the Bible, these spices have much to do with the Lord Jesus. Both at His birth and at His burial, myrrh was used by those who gave honor to Him. In the Song of Songs certain spices have a spiritual significance either with respect to the Lord Himself or to the one seeking Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjM1A6i4js7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> The record concerning the compound ointment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37316" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> is extremely significant. The Lord’s charge to Moses to make the compound ointment is very important. This charge was given after both the tabernacle with all its furniture and utensils and the priesthood had been revealed. This means that before the description of the ointment we have two entities. The first is the tabernacle, God’s dwelling place; the second is the priesthood, God’s serving ones. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1712" id="1712">[1712]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wJ1s23Cs_l3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e">GOD’S DWELLING PLACE AND THE PRIESTHOOD</h2><p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyNgv_KGLvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37317" data-verses="1Peter 2:1">First Peter 2</span> speaks of both God’s dwelling place and the priesthood. According to this chapter, God desires two things. First, the Lord Jesus is the living stone. As those who come to Him, we also are living stones, being built up a spiritual house and into a holy priesthood. Here we have the spiritual house, God’s dwelling, and also the priesthood, a body of serving ones. Actually, these two entities, the spiritual house and the priesthood, are one entity in two aspects. On the one hand, we are God’s dwelling place; on the other hand, we are God’s priesthood. We are a house for God to dwell in, and we are the priesthood to serve God. God needs a dwelling place on earth for His expression. At the same time, He also needs a serving priesthood. God wants to express Himself, and He wants to be served. Therefore, He desires a spiritual house and a holy priesthood. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqD9hB-hgkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> The revelation concerning the compound ointment was not given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37318" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">chapter one</span> of Exodus. It was not given even in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37319" data-verses="Exodus 29:1">chapter twenty-nine</span>, but toward the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37320" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">chapter thirty</span>, after God’s dwelling place and the priesthood had been revealed. This indicates that the compound ointment is solely for the purpose of anointing God’s dwelling place and His priesthood. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37321" data-verses="Exodus 30:26-28">30:26-28</span>, the ointment was used to anoint the tent of meeting, the ark, the table and its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense, the altar of burnt offering and its utensils, and the laver and its base. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37322" data-verses="Exodus 30:30">verse 30</span> says, “And you shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and you shall sanctify them to serve as priests to Me.” These verses make it very clear that the compound ointment was strictly for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle and the priests. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDToyBzM4YAr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb">THE ENJOYMENT OF THE LORD IN EXODUS</h2><p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XhJuYWYe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> In the book of Exodus there is a great deal of enjoyment. For example, the Passover was an enjoyment for the children of Israel. It was a feast that eventually was made an ordinance. Every year the first of the feasts was the feast of the Passover. The focus of this feast is the lamb, which typifies <span class="pg" data-page-id="1713" id="1713">[1713]</span> Christ as our Redeemer. This indicates that Christ is the initial enjoyment of God’s chosen people. Even while the children of Israel were still in Egypt, they could have a good enjoyment of the Passover lamb. Not only did they apply the blood to the lintel of the door, but they ate the flesh of the lamb. Hence, that lamb was for their enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9Mgo5lJRHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> After the children of Israel came into the wilderness, they began to enjoy the manna and the living water out of the cleft rock. The children of Israel, therefore, enjoyed at least three things—the Passover, the manna, and the living water. It is important for us to realize that they had all this enjoyment before the tabernacle and the priesthood were revealed. This means that even without the tabernacle and the priesthood, they could have the enjoyment of the lamb, the manna, and the living water. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCr85BwYfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> If we are clear concerning the situation of the children of Israel, we shall be able to see where today’s Christians stand. Where are most Christians: before the revelation of the tabernacle and the priesthood, or after? No doubt, the majority of Christians are before the revelation of the tabernacle and the priesthood. This means that the situation of today’s Christians is one without God’s dwelling and without God’s priesthood. At best, most Christians enjoy the Passover lamb, the manna, and the living water. However, the number of those who enjoy the living water is actually very few. When I was young, I heard much talk about the Passover lamb and also about the manna, but I did not hear nearly as much concerning the living water out of the cleft rock. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLX9XkquJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> We need to ask ourselves where we are with respect to the enjoyment of Christ. Do we have only the enjoyment that comes before the revelation of the tabernacle and the priesthood, that is, the enjoyment of the Lamb, the manna, and the water? Where are you concerning the enjoyment of Christ? Are you before the revelation of the tabernacle and the priesthood, or after? This question is extremely important. If in your enjoyment of Christ you are before the tabernacle and the priesthood, then you cannot have any share in the compound ointment. This ointment can be enjoyed only after God’s dwelling place and the body of serving ones have come <span class="pg" data-page-id="1714" id="1714">[1714]</span> into existence. It is not for God’s chosen people to enjoy apart from God’s dwelling and His priesthood. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG_g-Rr8fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> When asked whether your enjoyment of Christ is before or after the tabernacle and the priesthood, you may find it difficult to answer. You may hesitate, not knowing whether to say yes or no. However, I have the assurance that the vast majority of us have had at least some experience of the compound ointment. What we have enjoyed in our experience is not only the oil but the ointment. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNC-y00MaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> Whereas the oil is simple, containing just one element, the ointment is rich. As we have pointed out again and again, it is a compound produced by blending four spices with olive oil. It is extremely significant that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37323" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> we have a record of the divine revelation concerning this compound ointment. The elements and the quantity of these spices are also significant. Although there are four kinds of spices, there are actually only three complete units of five-hundred shekels each. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0qx8Mx5qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF<br/>THE NUMBERS THREE AND FIVE</h2><p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBe_oHAbqzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> In the record concerning the compound ointment, we have the numbers three and five. In the Bible, when the numbers three and five are put together, this combination is related to God’s building. God’s first building was the ark of Noah. In the description of the ark there are multiples of the numbers three and five: “The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37324" data-verses="Genesis 6:15">Gen. 6:15</span>). Furthermore, the ark was to be made “with lower, second, and third stories” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37325" data-verses="Genesis 6:16">Gen. 6:16</span>). God’s second building was the tabernacle. The tabernacle was of three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. With the tabernacle, the number five occurs frequently. For example, the tabernacle was made with ten curtains of fine linen. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37326" data-verses="Exodus 26:3">Exodus 26:3</span>, five curtains were joined to one another, and the other five curtains were also to be joined to one another. Furthermore, the curtains in the outer court were squares each measuring five cubits by five cubits. Also, the altar of burnt offering was five cubits in <span class="pg" data-page-id="1715" id="1715">[1715]</span> length and width, and three cubits in height. Therefore, with God’s second building we have the numbers three and five. </p>

Jehovah is the name of God in relation to man. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37400" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> we have only the title God, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37401" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we also have another title, Jehovah, because in this chapter God begins to have contact with the man created by Him. Therefore, Jehovah is a title used for God’s contact with man. It denotes God’s relationship with man. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cynizkmclAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> The name Jehovah is derived from, or is a form of, the verb to be. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37402" data-verses="Exodus 3:14">Exodus 3:14</span> says, “And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.” Jehovah is the One who was, the One who is, and the One who is to be. “Was,” “is,” and “will be”—all these are forms of the verb to be. Actually, the verb to be can be applied only to God. He alone is, was, and will be. He alone is the eternal, self-existing One. Our life is short. If we do not have God, we shall not continue to be and even we are not actually existing now, for the verb to be cannot be applied to us as it is uniquely applied to God. The verb to be is the basic verb. Everything else depends on this. For example, eating depends on being, on existence. If I did not exist, how could I eat? All other verbs, perhaps numbering in the thousands, depend on this unique verb, the verb to be. Only God is the One who is; He alone is the I Am, the ever-existing and self-existing One. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzl3yJ93EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> In order for God to be related to man, He must be triune—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37403" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span>, Jehovah refers to the Triune God. This is indicated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37404" data-verses="Exodus 3:6">3:6</span>, where God says, “I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” After God said to Moses, “I AM THAT I AM” and told him to tell the children of Israel, “I AM hath sent me unto you,” He went on to say to him, “Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37405" data-verses="Exodus 3:15">v. 15</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37406" data-verses="Exodus 3:14">3:14</span> God says, “I AM hath sent me <span class="pg" data-page-id="1723" id="1723">[1723]</span> unto you,” but in the next verse He says, “Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you.” This indicates that Jehovah is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. This title of God—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—implies the Three of the Godhead, the Trinity. In our Life-study of Genesis we pointed out that much of the book of Genesis is related to God as the God of three persons: Abraham, the father; Isaac, the son; and Jacob, the supplanter, the subtle one who was eventually transformed. The God of Abraham signifies the Father; the God of Isaac, the Son; and the God of Jacob, the Spirit. Jehovah, God in His relationship with man, is the Triune God. Therefore, the Spirit of Jehovah is the Spirit with the element of the divine Trinity. </p>

However, the King James Version does not make this fact clear in its translation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37429" data-verses="Psalms 51:11">Psalm 51:11</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37430" data-verses="Isaiah 63:10-11">Isaiah 63:10-11</span>. “Thy Holy Spirit” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37431" data-verses="Psalms 51:11">Psalm 51:11</span> should be “the Spirit of Thy holiness,” and “his Holy Spirit” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37432" data-verses="Isaiah 63:10-11">Isaiah 63:10 and 11</span> should be “the Spirit of His holiness.” The title “the Holy Spirit” was first used with respect to Christ’s incarnation, to the time when the Spirit came to Mary to conceive the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4CL-1K2xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37433" data-verses="Luke 1:35">Luke 1:35</span>, the angel said to Mary, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; wherefore also the holy thing which is born will be called, Son of God.” The Greek words rendered <span class="pg" data-page-id="1724" id="1724">[1724]</span> “holy thing” may also be rendered “holy one.” Both are correct. Before the incarnation of Christ, no one had been holy in nature. Rather, everyone from the time of Adam onward was common, ordinary. In the Old Testament the Holy Spirit did not make anyone holy with the holy nature of God. Of course, certain persons and things were holy in the sense that they were separated unto God. For example, Aaron was separated unto the Lord to serve as high priest, but he did not become holy with the holy nature of God. Not until the Lord Jesus was born was there One who was holy in nature. This was possible because He was conceived of the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit has the element of the divine nature, which is holy. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37434" data-verses="Matthew 1:18">Matthew 1:18</span> says that Mary “was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.” Also, the angel of the Lord said to Joseph, “Fear not to take Mary your wife, for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37435" data-verses="Matthew 1:20">v. 20</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9AKoCMqyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> In the New Testament sometimes the Greek says “the Spirit, the holy.” This expression indicates that the Spirit is the holy. This reveals that the Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of Jehovah, is now something further—the Holy Spirit with God’s holy nature, to bring forth someone who is holy in nature just as God Himself is holy. God is holy in His nature, not just in position. Because the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit, He also is holy in nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl62fqmMovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> The Holy Spirit is of such a nature as to make us, the believers, holy with God’s nature. If we understand this, we shall know the meaning of sanctification in the New Testament. New Testament sanctification is to make us holy not merely in position but also in nature. It is to make us holy in nature, even as God is holy. Therefore, we say that the Holy Spirit has the element of the holy divine nature. </p>

Recently I was asked how the Spirit of glory is related to other aspects of the Spirit. The Spirit of glory is not related as much to the nature of God as other aspects of the Spirit are. Furthermore, the type of the compound ointment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37526" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> does not indicate much that is related to the glory of God.

The Spirit of God has the element of divinity, the element of what God is. The Spirit of Jehovah has the element of the divine Trinity, the element of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Holy Spirit has the element of the holy divine nature. Because the Holy Spirit has this element, the Holy Spirit can make us holy in nature, even as God is holy. This process of sanctification began with the conceiving of the Lord Jesus in the womb of Mary. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37528" data-verses="Luke 1:35">Luke 1:35</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="1734" id="1734">[1734]</span> speaks of Him as “the holy thing.” Because the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit, He is holy in constitution, not merely in position. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUXk5OAMrQmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> Not one of those who lived from the time of Adam until the birth of the Lord Jesus was holy in nature. Many had been sanctified in the sense of being separated unto God, but none of these sanctified ones was made holy with God’s nature. In other words, none of them had been constituted of the holy nature of God. For example, although Aaron was sanctified to serve God as a priest, he was not constituted of God’s holy nature. Therefore, the Spirit of God with the element of divinity and the Spirit of Jehovah with the element of the Trinity came as the Holy Spirit, the Spirit with the element of the holy divine nature, to produce a child who would be constituted of God’s holy nature. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37529" data-verses="Luke 1:35">Luke 1:35</span>, that child is called the “holy thing” or “the holy One.” He was holy not only in the sense of being separated unto God, but He was holy in nature, for the holy divine nature had been constituted into Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNC-S00OaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> In the New Testament sanctification includes being constituted of the holy nature of God. In this sense, sanctification is a continuation of incarnation. In the incarnation, the Lord Jesus was constituted of the holy nature of God. Now through the process of sanctification, we who believe in Christ are also being constituted of God’s nature. If we see this, we shall realize that the teachings concerning sanctification among Christians today are very shallow, even more shallow than the concept of sanctification found in the Old Testament. Actually, New Testament sanctification is incarnation. It is the incarnation of the holy divine nature into our humanity so that we may become holy in nature, even as God Himself is holy. </p>

In God’s New Testament economy we first have the Spirit of reality. Apart from the Spirit of reality, in our experience we could not have divinity, the Trinity, or the holy nature of God. These would be nothing more than terms to us. We would not have the reality of divinity, the reality of the Trinity, and the reality of the holy divine nature, if we did not have the Spirit of reality. The reality of all these matters is the Spirit of reality. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeUN7WzqNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> While the Lord Jesus was still on earth, reality had not yet entered into man. The reality was present, for Christ Himself is reality. But this reality was only among the disciples; it had not yet come into them. Therefore, the Lord told the disciples that it was expedient for them that He go away. The purpose of His going was for Him to have a change in form, a change from the form of the flesh to the form of the Spirit. As soon as this change had been accomplished, His reality would become the reality of the Spirit, and the Spirit would become the Spirit of reality. Then this Spirit of reality would come to abide in the disciples. The Lord Jesus said in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37532" data-verses="John 14:17">John 14:17</span>, “Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.” Because the Spirit of reality has come into us, reality now abides in us. </p>

In particular, it is the aspect of the Spirit that includes the Lord’s sufferings. The entire life of the Lord Jesus from birth to burial was a life of suffering. He was born in a manger, an indication that He would live a life of suffering. Shortly after He was born, He became a refugee. That was part of His sufferings. When His family returned to the holy land after fleeing to Egypt, it was not possible for them to stay in Judea. They had to live in Galilee, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1736" id="1736">[1736]</span> in the despised city of Nazareth. The title “the Spirit of Jesus” implies the Lord’s sufferings in His human life. The extract of the Lord’s human life is included now in the Spirit of Jesus. </p>

The Spirit of Christ includes the element, the extract, of Christ’s resurrection. The Spirit of Jesus Christ includes incarnation, humanity, human living, suffering, crucifixion, and resurrection. The Spirit of life is the reality of the divine life. Christ is both life and the Giver of life. The Spirit is both the Spirit of life and the life-giving Spirit. As the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit has the ability to impart life to us. The title “the Lord Spirit” implies the ascension and lordship of Christ. Today the man Jesus Christ is the Lord of all. The reality of His lordship is in the Spirit. When we contact the Spirit, we touch the element of the Lord’s ascension and lordship. </p>

In this message and in the two messages following we shall first consider the ingredients of the compound Spirit, and then we shall consider the function of the compound Spirit. Actually, our main concern will be with the function. But in order to understand the function of the compound Spirit, we need to see the ingredients of this Spirit. Knowing this will also help us to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37554" data-verses="1John 2:18-27">1 John 2:18-27</span>. </p>

<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_CiYF6W_5KauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> John’s Gospel and Epistles were written at a time when different heresies concerning the Person of Christ were creeping in. According to one of these heresies, it was claimed that <span class="pg" data-page-id="1742" id="1742">[1742]</span> Christ was divine, but it was denied that He was human. According to this heretical teaching, Christ was God, but He was not a man. This is a heresy related to Christ’s humanity. According to another heretical teaching, Christ was human, not divine; it was claimed that He was a man, but not God. This is a heresy with respect to Christ’s deity. Therefore, these two heretical schools represent two extreme positions. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQeyQts7iwajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> In his Gospel John declares that the Word, which is God, became flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37559" data-verses="John 1:1">1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37560" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). The word “flesh” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37561" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> no doubt refers to Christ’s humanity. The Word is God, and this Word became flesh, a man. This reveals that Christ is both God and man. All genuine Christians confess that Jesus Christ is both God and man. Throughout the centuries, a number of great teachers have used the term “God-man” to express the fact that Christ is God and man. He was God before incarnation, but through incarnation He became a man. Therefore, after His incarnation, Christ was both God and man, the God-man. </p>

The anointing in these verses is a sign that has its source in the type of the anointing oil in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37565" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>. The anointing oil was a compounded ointment, an ointment containing a number of elements. The basic element was olive oil. We may use today’s oil-based paint as a simple illustration of the compounded ointment. The basic element of this kind of paint is oil, and to this oil other ingredients or elements are added. In the same principle, to the basic element of olive oil the four spices were added to produce a compounded ointment. This compounded ointment was formed by blending olive oil with four spices. It is very helpful for us to know all the elements of this compound and what they signify. </p>

The Spirit of Christ is the compound Spirit, and this Spirit is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.

<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldTyT8-FcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> What are the ingredients, the elements, that constitute the compound Spirit? The first element is the only God, the unique God, signified both by the olive oil itself and also by the quantity of olive oil, a hin. In Hebrew measurement, a hin is a complete unit. In this sense, a hin can be compared to a pound as a complete unit of sixteen ounces. A hin is, therefore, a Hebrew expression signifying a complete unit. The one hin of olive oil in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37568" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> signifies the only God, the Creator (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37569" data-verses="1Timothy 1:17">1 Tim. 1:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37570" data-verses="Romans 16:27">Rom. 16:27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37571" data-verses="Exodus 30:24">Exo. 30:24</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6fOAcLxIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> One hin of olive oil as the base of the compounded ointment signifies the unique God as the base of the compound Spirit. This understanding is logical and meaningful. We believe in God, but not in the simple way of the Jews. Instead, we believe in God according to the complete revelation of the New Testament. In the New Testament God is no longer merely God with the single element of divinity, for He has been mingled with other elements. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cBxvOlTYxWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> Consider again the blending of the spices with the olive oil to produce the compounded ointment. First, the olive oil was of one element. But after it was compounded, or blended, with four kinds of spices, it no longer had just a single element. It had become a compound of five elements. Of these five elements, one—the oil—is the base, and the others—the four spices—are the ingredients for compounding. This indicates that in the Old Testament the Spirit of God was of one element, and that element was the unique God, the Creator. However, the New Testament reveals that a process of blending, of compounding, has taken place. This process involved Christ’s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. After passing through this process of blending, compounding, the Spirit of God is no longer simply the Spirit with one element. Now He is the compound Spirit. However, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1744" id="1744">[1744]</span> this Spirit still has the unique God as the base. This base, the one God, is typified by the hin of olive oil. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUXk5eAE4AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ">The Triune God, the Father, the Son,<br/>and the Spirit—the Three Units<br/>of the Measure of the Four Spices</h2><p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-56qzFcZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> In the compound Spirit we also have the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Perhaps you are wondering how it is possible to see the Triune God typified by the compounded ointment. In this ointment the Triune God is typified by the three units of the measure of the four spices (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37572" data-verses="Exodus 30:23-24">Exo. 30:23-24</span>). In the compounded ointment there were five hundred shekels of myrrh, two hundred fifty shekels each of cinnamon and calamus, and five hundred shekels of cassia. Although there were four spices, there was a total of three units of five hundred shekels in measure. But how can we apply this to the Triune God? The first unit is five hundred shekels of myrrh. However, the second unit of five hundred shekels is split in half: two hundred fifty shekels of cinnamon and two hundred fifty shekels of calamus. The third unit is five hundred shekels of cassia. Notice that it is the second unit, the middle one, that is split into two parts. Surely this points to the Second of the Triune God, the Son, and to His crucifixion. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMAP6IRh-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> The greatest teaching in the Bible is that of the Trinity of the Godhead. According to the Hebrew language, the first time God is mentioned in the Bible (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37573" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Gen. 1:1</span>), the word <em>Elohim</em> is used. The name <em>Elohim,</em> meaning God, is in the plural. This is a hint of the Trinity. Furthermore, we are told in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37574" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> that when God was about to create man, He said to Himself, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” This is another indication that God is triune. However, it is not, of course, a clear revelation of the Trinity. We have such a clear revelation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37575" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>, where, after His resurrection, the Lord Jesus gave this charge to His disciples: “Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” Here we have one name for the Three of the Godhead, for the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1745" id="1745">[1745]</span> </p>

This precious death is, according to this type, compounded with the anointing Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37607" data-verses="Romans 6:3">Romans 6:3</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37608" data-verses="Romans 6:6">6</span> Paul says that we who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death, and that our old man has been crucified with Christ. The death of Christ into which we have been baptized is actually included in the Spirit. Without the Spirit, the death of Christ is only a historical fact, and it can never become our experience.

The effectiveness of <span class="pg" data-page-id="1750" id="1750">[1750]</span> the death of Christ can be compared to an antibiotic used to kill germs. If someone is suffering from a disease caused by certain bacteria or germs, he may take a certain medicine to kill those germs. The effectiveness of Christ’s death can be regarded as the spiritual antibiotic to kill the “germs” within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9fSplOdEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37610" data-verses="Galatians 5:22-24">Galatians 5:22-24</span> indicates that the death of Christ functions like a spiritual antibiotic. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37611" data-verses="Galatians 5:22-23">Verses 22 and 23</span> speak of the fruit of the Spirit. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37612" data-verses="Galatians 5:24">verse 24</span> says, “But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts.” Physically speaking, no one can crucify himself. A person can commit suicide many different ways, but he cannot commit suicide by crucifying himself. Anyone crucified in ancient times was hung on a cross by others. Since crucifixion is not an action that we can perform on ourselves, why does Paul say in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37613" data-verses="Galatians 5:24">Galatians 5:24</span> that they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh? If we read the context of this verse with understanding, we shall see that we do not actually crucify ourselves by ourselves alone. Rather, this crucifixion is carried out by the Spirit from whom is the fruit of the Spirit. The Spirit who bears fruit within us is the One by whom we crucify ourselves. This corresponds to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37614" data-verses="Romans 8:13">Romans 8:13</span>: “For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.” By ourselves we are not able to put to death the practices of the body. Likewise, we are not able to crucify ourselves. We need a crucifier, someone to crucify us. Christ was crucified by Roman soldiers. Today we experience crucifixion through and by the indwelling Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfSGnmSxPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> Do you know where the effectiveness of the death of Christ is? The effectiveness of the death of Christ is in the all-inclusive Spirit. This Spirit includes the element of the effectiveness of the wonderful death of Christ. This means that the death of Christ spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37615" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span> has become an ingredient of the indwelling Spirit spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37616" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. The “medicine” of the Spirit thus contains the effectiveness of Christ’s death as the element to kill the germs, the harmful bacteria, within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr8678S7e4ocJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> Throughout the years many have taught from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37617" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="1751" id="1751">[1751]</span> that our old man has been crucified with Christ. However, few have seen the proper way to experience our death with Christ described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37618" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span>. Only when we realize that the effectiveness of the death of Christ has been compounded into the all-inclusive Spirit can we have the proper experience of being crucified with Christ. Once we realize that the death of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37619" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span> has been compounded into the all-inclusive, indwelling Spirit, we should simply walk in this Spirit. This is to take the “medicine” of the Spirit containing the killing element of Christ’s death. There is no need for us to try to kill ourselves or the germs within us. We simply need to take the antibiotic, which will then do an excellent work within us to kill all the germs. Our experience testifies of this. We can testify that when we walk in the Spirit, a killing work is taking place within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnlbcNXOmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> We can experience this killing work in our daily lives. Suppose a brother does not care for the indwelling Spirit, but instead, rejecting the Spirit, quarrels with his wife and says some very unkind things to her. However, suppose this same brother prays himself into the Spirit, lives in the Spirit, and walks in the Spirit. This will make it extremely difficult for him to argue with his wife. As soon as he opens his mouth to quarrel with her, he will experience the element of Christ’s death operating within him. Then he finds it impossible to argue with her. Many married brothers have had this kind of experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH8qTasYW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> I believe that a good number of sisters have experienced the “antibiotic” in the Spirit in relation to their shopping. If a sister does not pray herself into the Spirit, live in the Spirit, and walk in the Spirit, then she may go shopping without any inward restriction. For this reason, I would encourage the sisters to pray thoroughly and properly before they go shopping. A sister may say, “Lord, let us go shopping together. In the matter of shopping, I don’t want to leave You. Rather, I want to stay with You.” If a sister goes shopping in this way, she will experience the Lord’s limitation and restriction. She may pick up a certain item and consider buying it. But then, sensing the restriction of the Spirit, she will put it down. Sometimes she may leave the store without buying anything, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1752" id="1752">[1752]</span> because she paid attention to the Spirit within her. This is an experience of the effectiveness of the Lord’s sweet death being applied to us by the all-inclusive Spirit. Many of us can testify that whenever we have this kind of experience, we feel that we are with the Lord in the heavens. </p>

After we experience the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ’s death, we are ushered into resurrection.

She will experience the precious resurrection of Christ. </p>

It repels the demons and all negative things. </p>

The ingredients of the Spirit include the unique God, the Triune God, the humanity of Jesus, the precious death of Christ, the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ’s death, the precious resurrection of Christ, the power of Christ’s resurrection, the mingling of divinity with humanity, the power for responsibility, and the building element. We have seen that the anointing of the compound Spirit is to anoint the believers with the Father and the Son, conveyed in the anointing Spirit, and to anoint the believers with the eternal life conveyed in this Spirit. The anointing of the compound Spirit is also to inoculate the believers against the heretical teachings concerning the Person of Christ. Furthermore, the believers may abide in the Lord according to the teaching of the anointing that abides in us. In this message we shall consider further the anointing of the Spirit as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37649" data-verses="1John 2:18-27">1 John 2:18-27</span>.

This is the antichrist, who is denying the Father and the Son.” This verse was written according to the background of John’s first Epistle. If we do not know anything about this background, we shall not be able to understand this verse adequately. Those who denied that Jesus is the Christ separated Jesus from Christ, making them two persons. Hence, to say that Jesus is not Christ is to divide Jesus from Christ, as if Jesus and Christ were different persons. The existence of such heretical teaching was part of the background of John’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37652" data-verses="1John 2:22">verse 22</span> regarding those who denied that Jesus is the Christ. The truth is that Jesus is the Christ. Jesus and Christ are one. It is heresy to say that Jesus is not the Christ. </p>

First, this verse says that the antichrist denies that Jesus is Christ. Then the verse goes on to say that antichrist denies the Father and the Son. This indicates that Jesus Christ, the Father, and the Son are all one. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-57KzFeZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> A serious problem in theology related to the Person of Christ and the Trinity is caused by those who try to divide the Father from the Son, and the Son from the Spirit. This is to attempt to systematize Jesus Christ and the Triune God. It is wrong to try to separate Jesus Christ, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. It is also wrong to try to systematize the Trinity. Actually, we cannot divide Jesus Christ, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, because They all are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMAOaIRj-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> Some Bible teachers try to separate the Father from the Son, and the Son from the Spirit. These teachers deny that the Son is the Father and also that the Son is the Spirit. As a result of their attempt to separate the Father from the Son, and the Son from the Spirit, they have three Gods. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbEMO9gI7HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> Just as we cannot divide the Father, Son, and Spirit, we cannot divide Christ’s divinity from His humanity. There is no way to divide Christ’s divinity from His humanity. Trying to divide Christ’s divinity and humanity can be compared to dividing a person’s body from his soul, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="1759" id="1759">[1759]</span> his body and soul from his spirit to make three separate, distinct entities. Anyone who could be divided in this way would no longer be a whole person. This is an illustration of the seriousness of the mistake of trying to divide and separate the Father from the Son, and the Son from the Spirit. That attempt results in the heresy of tritheism, the belief that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three Gods. </p>

According to this verse, if we deny the Son, we do not have the Father, but if we confess the Son, we have the Father. </p>

They cannot be separated. The error of heretical teachings concerning both Christology and the Trinity has been to divide, to separate, the Son from the Father, and the Spirit from the Son. But especially in these verses, the Bible puts the Father and the Son together as a compound. It is the work of antichrist to divide the Father from the Son. </p>

If that which you heard from the beginning abides in you, you will abide both in the Son and in the Father.” What was it that the believers heard from the beginning? From the beginning they heard the apostles preaching concerning the Trinity. Therefore, in this verse John is telling the believers to allow the truth of the proper Trinity to abide in them. If they allow this truth to abide in them, they will abide in the Son and in the Father. Actually, what they heard through the apostles’ preaching was the Father and the Son, not merely a doctrine. They heard the reality of the Father and the Son. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1760" id="1760">[1760]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Fitjj9rck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> Here John seems to be saying, “We spoke to you the reality of the Father and the Son. We taught this to you, and you heard it and received it. You did not receive merely a doctrine. Rather, you received the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.” But where is the Spirit here? The Spirit is the anointing spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37657" data-verses="1John 2:20">verses 20</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37658" data-verses="1John 2:27">27</span>. </p>

With my logical mind I asked, “What is this verse saying? First, John talks about Jesus Christ, then the Son and the Father. Now he brings up the matter of eternal life. What is John talking about? Is the subject of his writing here Jesus Christ, the Father and the Son, or eternal life? It seems to me that John actually has three subjects.” Viewing this portion in this way, I could not understand it or reconcile the various subjects in it. Recently I have come to understand that here we have a compound, a mingling or blending, of Jesus Christ, the Father, the Son, and eternal life. Theologians may be bothered by this understanding of these verses. But I believe that if we receive light from the Lord, we shall see that this interpretation is correct. Here we have the compounding, the mingling, of Jesus Christ, the Father and the Son, and eternal life. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755T3_DLg8djlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37660" data-verses="1John 2:26">verse 26</span> John continues, “These things I have written to you concerning those who are leading you astray.” Actually, the word “things” is not found in this verse, as indicated by the fact that some versions print it in italics. Hence, John is saying that “these” he wrote to the saints concerning them that would seduce them. To what does “these” refer? It must refer to Jesus Christ, the Father and the Son, and eternal life. Furthermore, “I have written” actually means “I am writing.” Therefore, John could say, “I am writing to you concerning those who seduce you.” Antichrist and the false prophets teach that Christ is separate from Jesus and that the Son is separate from the Father. This kind of heretical teaching is seductive and misleading. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1761" id="1761">[1761]</span> </p>

The anointing that abides in us is a Person moving, acting, within us. This anointing Person is the anointing. Who is this anointing Person?

Why does this verse put these two matters together? Why does it speak both of the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ and of the one who denies the Father and the Son? The answer to these questions is that to deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny the Father and the Son. It is also the case that to deny the Father and the Son is to deny that Jesus is the Christ. This indicates that Jesus is the Christ and that Christ is the Father and the Son. It also indicates that Jesus, Christ, the Father, and the Son are all one.

But if we confess the Son, we shall have the Father. Here we have the same matter viewed from different aspects. On the one hand, if we deny the Son, we deny the Father.

Heretical teachers used their natural, human mentality to analyze the all-inclusive divine Person of Christ. But they had no way to systematize this Person. They could not figure out how Jesus could be the Christ or how Christ could be the Father. Some even claimed that Christ was God but not man. They argued that it was not possible for one person to be both God and man at the same time. Others claimed that Jesus was a man but not God. However, the apostle John wrote, “The Word became flesh” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37692" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>). The Word is God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37693" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>), and the flesh here denotes humanity.

All genuine Christians would agree that Jesus is the Christ, that Christ is the Son of God, that the Son of God is God, and that God is triune. If we agree to all this, then we must go on to say that Christ is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Furthermore, we need to see that Jesus, Christ, the Son of God, God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all one all-inclusive Person. </p>

The teaching of <span class="pg" data-page-id="1771" id="1771">[1771]</span> certain ones concerning the Person of Christ and the Trinity is based upon the principle of separation, which is the attempt to separate the Father, the Son, and the Spirit one from the other.

This attempt to separate the Father from the Son, and the Son from the Spirit has led to heresy both in ancient times and today. </p>

Here we have a principle that applies to many of today’s teachers. These teachers may be genuine Christians, yet, at least in part, they are antichrist in their teaching because they deny Christ in a particular aspect of His all-inclusive Person. To deny Christ in any way is to be antichrist, at least to a certain extent. This is the reason John refers to the heretics as antichrist. Their teachings were antichrist in that in some way or in some aspect they denied Christ. For example, the teaching that says that Christ is God is pro-Christ, not antichrist. But the teaching that Christ is only God and not man is antichrist. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjM1Baixws7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> Some admit that Christ is the Creator, but they deny strongly that He is also a creature with respect to His humanity. To say that Christ is the Creator is pro-Christ, but to deny the fact that with respect to His humanity He is a creature is to utter something that is antichrist. We must be pro-Christ in an all-inclusive way and say that He is both the Creator and a creature. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wJ1tW3K_vl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e">THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8coK-JgqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> The Bible reveals that the Son is called the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37695" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isa. 9:6</span>) and that He is the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37696" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>). Consider the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1772" id="1772">[1772]</span> revelation of the Triune God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37697" data-verses="John 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> of John. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37698" data-verses="John 14:8">verse 8</span> Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us.” Apparently surprised at Philip’s request, the Lord Jesus answered, “Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. How is it that you say, Show us the Father?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37699" data-verses="John 14:9">v. 9</span>). Then the Lord went on to say, “Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me?” Here the Lord seems to be saying, “Philip, have I been with you so long and still you don’t know Me? Don’t you realize that when you see Me, you see the Father? I am one with the Father. The Father is in Me, and I am in the Father. Apart from Me and outside of Me, there is not such a Person called the Father.” </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5C4XHIF4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37700" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span> says, “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...The mighty God, The everlasting Father.” According to this verse, the Son given to us is called the everlasting Father, or the Father of eternity. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fTwl2_StcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> Not long ago a certain preacher said that the Father in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37701" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span> is merely similar in meaning to the title “father of his country” applied to Washington and the “father of electricity” applied to Edison. Even if we accept this kind of understanding, we need to ask of what father is the Son. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37702" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>, He is the Father of eternity. The title “Father of eternity” actually means “the eternal Father.” Some versions translate the Hebrew in this way. The Father of eternity means the Father who exists forever, the eternal Father. The phrase “of eternity” denotes One who is self-existing and everlasting. Therefore, the Father of eternity is the Father who is self-existing and everlasting. Who is this Father who is self-existing and everlasting? Are there two such Fathers—the Father in the Godhead and another Father who is the Son in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37703" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>? The answer to this question is that the Father in the Godhead is the Father of eternity, and according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37704" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span> the Son is also the Father of eternity. There are not two divine Fathers! There is only one Father of eternity, the Father who is self-existing and everlasting. </p>

<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fTw127ANcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> Toward the end of the section concerned with the revelation of the tabernacle two things are described: the anointing oil and the incense. I believe that in the foregoing messages we have considered thoroughly the matter of the anointing oil. We have seen that this oil is a fine and all-inclusive type of Christ being the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. As the life-giving Spirit, Christ not only comes to us from God, but He is also God coming to us. His coming is not only from God but also with God, for Christ comes as God. Eventually, this coming One passed through death and resurrection and has become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. There is a divine traffic in this universe that moves in two directions. The coming of God to us in Christ is the first direction of this divine traffic. With the incense we have the other direction of this divine traffic, Christ going from us to God. Therefore, the anointing oil is Christ as God coming to us from God, and the incense is Christ going from us to God. It is important that we all see this two-way traffic. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vRpSdrnXqd_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> This traffic has much to do with our Christian experience. Do you know what our Christian experience is? It is God coming to us in Christ and our going to God in Christ and with Christ. God’s coming to us is a matter of the anointing, and our going to God is a matter of prayer. This divine traffic is the proper Christian experience. In particular, our going to God in Christ requires experience. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4bqZI0yGiuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS">THREE FRAGRANT SPICES</h2><p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL435fyT_8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> Without adequate spiritual experience, we shall not be <span class="pg" data-page-id="1778" id="1778">[1778]</span> able to understand the type of the incense or interpret it. This type is actually very strange, more strange than that of the anointing oil. The incense is strange because its three spices—stacte, onycha, and galbanum—are unusual. Even the words themselves are not common. Rather, they are peculiar words used to refer to unusual things. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_CiZF6ftZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> More than twenty years ago, I spent a good deal of time to study the incense and its ingredients. Then I gave messages on the incense on at least two occasions. Some of those messages were published in the book <em>How to Meet.</em> </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQeyRtszwAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37729" data-verses="Exodus 30:34">Exodus 30:34</span> says, “And Jehovah said to Moses, Take to yourself fragrant spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum—fragrant spices, and pure frankincense; there shall be an equal part of each.” In this verse the Lord twice speaks of fragrant spices. Stacte, the first of these spices, is a resinous gum used as the purest myrrh, a myrrh that is edible. Years ago I read that this kind of myrrh can be used as an expectorant. In particular, it can heal the throat and reduce excess saliva. It is an edible medicine. However, the other two spices, onycha and galbanum, are not edible. Actually, they are poisonous. Galbanum has a very disagreeable odor that is even poisonous. Nevertheless, the Lord indicates that it also is a fragrant spice. Later we shall see how this disagreeable and poisonous element can be fragrant. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755T3_jLj89jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv">PRAYER ASCENDING TO GOD</h2><p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoACpCTw6BePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> Most Christians, including those who have been in the Lord’s recovery for many years, still do not have much knowledge of what genuine prayer is. Furthermore, we may not have much experience of genuine prayer. We thank the Lord that sometimes our prayer is genuine. But most of the time our prayers have not been genuine. Only a small percentage of our prayers have been genuine. For the most part, our prayers have been natural. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyNguPKGKvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> Both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament incense signifies our prayer. In the Psalms the saints’ prayer is likened to incense that is offered to God and ascends to Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37730" data-verses="Psalms 141:2">Psa. 141:2</span>). However, incense is not actually for offering; it is for ascending. We often speak of a prayer being offered to <span class="pg" data-page-id="1779" id="1779">[1779]</span> the Lord. Strictly speaking, this understanding is not scriptural. According to the Bible, prayer is not an offering; it is an incense that ascends to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqD9gx-hhkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> We have seen that with the tabernacle there were two altars: the bronze altar in the outer court and the golden altar in the Holy Place. The bronze altar was for burning offerings, sacrifices. On that altar offerings were presented to God. Of course, with the burning of the offerings on the bronze altar in the outer court something did ascend to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDToyBy84YBr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> The golden altar inside the tabernacle was close to the ark in the Holy of Holies. At this golden altar of incense no offerings were offered. The burnt offering, the meal offering, or any other kind of offering could not be presented there. This altar was only for the purpose of burning incense to God. Therefore, the incense that was burned at the golden altar ascended to God. This is not an offering; it is an ascending. The incense that ascends to God typifies our prayer. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XhIeYWZe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-">THE SWEETNESS OF GENUINE PRAYER</h2><p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9MgpJlJSHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> The incense was not for God to see; it was for Him to smell. This indicates that God smells our prayer rather than sees it. What does your prayer smell like? This question may help us to realize that the incense is a deeper type, a type that cannot be understood merely according to doctrine or teaching. We can understand this type only by our experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCr9JBwbfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> Both the ointment and the incense are Christ. God’s coming to us is Christ, and our prayer ascending to Him is also Christ. The anointing is from God and is also of God, for the anointing actually is God Himself. We have used paint as an illustration of the ointment. Just as we paint a wall with paint, so God anoints us with Himself. He “paints” us with Himself as the divine paint. When God anoints us with Himself as the ointment, He is applied to us and comes into us. In other words, when God anoints us with Himself, He is added to us. His divine element is added to our being in somewhat the same way as paint is added to a wall. This anointing is God’s coming. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLX8nkpvpfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> Now we must go on to realize that our prayer is our going to God in Christ. Furthermore, because the incense <span class="pg" data-page-id="1780" id="1780">[1780]</span> is Christ, our prayer is actually a matter of going to God as Christ. What is genuine prayer? Genuine prayer is Christ. This kind of prayer, prayer which is actually Christ, is our going to God in Christ. This is not merely our going to God; it is our going to God through Christ and with Christ. The anointing brings God to us for our participation in the divine element. The incense is our going to God with Christ and as Christ in prayer for God’s enjoyment. At the altar in the outer court God has food. But the fragrance that makes God happy and satisfies Him ascends from the golden altar of incense. What God desires is not only food to satisfy His appetite, but also a pleasant fragrance to please Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG_hORo9_iyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> Day by day we may eat healthy, nourishing food. But sometimes this food has little taste. Often people go to a restaurant not to enjoy nourishing food but to enjoy pleasant-tasting food. Children, in particular, like to eat things that taste good. God also has a sense of taste and smell. Do not think that God is so majestic that He does not enjoy a fragrant aroma. God not only eats—He also enjoys a pleasant fragrance. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNC_C03O6oTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> At the bronze altar we offer Christ to God as food. The burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering all typify Christ as food for God to eat. Whenever we offer Christ to God as the peace offering, there is food for God to eat. However, we need to remember that God also enjoys tasting and smelling. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0qwMMy7KQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> Very few Christians are interested in hearing about things like this. Only those Christians who truly seek the Lord have the desire to know these things. If you are not seeking the Lord Himself, you will have no interest in messages on the incense. Such messages will not tickle your ears. But the genuine seeking ones surely will want to hear a word concerning the incense. They will be interested in hearing about what is sweet smelling to God. I can testify that genuine prayer is sweet. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl60PqgcYvIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3">THE COMPOSITION OF THE OINTMENT<br/>AND THE INCENSE</h2><p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yM_kYXn89qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> In both the anointing oil and the incense we have the numbers three, four, and five. Furthermore, in both the Triune God is portrayed. In both the anointing oil and the incense we see divinity, humanity, the mingling of divinity with humanity, and the death and resurrection of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9NLSfAwqRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9">The Triune God</h2><p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8crq-JiqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> In the messages on the anointing oil we pointed out that although there were four spices, the quantity of these spices was three units of five hundred shekels each. The middle unit, formed of cinnamon and calamus, was divided into two parts, each measuring two hundred fifty shekels. Therefore, with the anointing oil we have four spices but only three units. These three units signify the Triune God. This is made especially clear by the fact that the middle unit signifies the Son who was “split” on the cross. With the incense we have three spices instead of four. As we shall see, these three spices of the incense also signify the Triune God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1788" id="1788">[1788]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5C73HIH4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> In the incense there are three kinds of spices—stacte, onycha, and galbanum—with pure frankincense. According to the numbers and items of the ingredients, there are three in one, that is, three kinds of spices with pure frankincense. According to the grammatical construction of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37737" data-verses="Exodus 30:34">verse 34</span>, the three spices form one group, while the fourth item, the pure frankincense, is in a category by itself. Therefore, here we have three plus one, which equals four. Three is the number of the Triune God, and four, the number of the creature, the human being, used in a positive sense. The meaning here is that the Triune God becomes a human being. Divinity is brought into humanity. This, of course, refers to Jesus Christ. He is the very God becoming a Man; He is divinity brought into humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fTzF28SNcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> All four ingredients were compounded and mingled into one incense. Therefore, here we have God mingled with man, God compounded with man, divinity mingled and compounded with humanity, to produce the incense. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vRpRtrhF6d_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52">Generating Life and Redeeming Life</h2><p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4bqa407VCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37738" data-verses="Exodus 30:34">Exodus 30:34</span> says, “And Jehovah said to Moses, Take to yourself fragrant spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum—fragrant spices, and pure frankincense; there shall be an equal part of each.” Both the first spice, stacte, and the third, galbanum, are resinous gums produced by trees. The middle spice, onycha, is the shell of a little animal. The order of these three spices is significant. It is important that the onycha is not mentioned either first or last, but in the middle. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL40Jf6AP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> As we have pointed out a number of times in foregoing messages, there are two factors in the life of Christ: the generating or producing life, signified by the vegetable life, and the redeeming life, signified by the animal life. Both aspects of Christ’s life can be seen in the Gospel of John. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37739" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>, Christ is the grain of wheat that falls into the ground, dies, and produces many other grains. This is the vegetable life as the generating, producing, life. The animal life, however, is for redemption, for it is a life that can be slain and from which blood may be shed. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37740" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span> we see the redeeming life of Christ: “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes <span class="pg" data-page-id="1789" id="1789">[1789]</span> away the sin of the world!” Christ is the Lamb who was crucified for our redemption. Christ, therefore, has both a generating life and a redeeming life. As the Lamb of God, Christ has the life signified by the animal life, and as the grain of wheat, He has the life signified by the vegetable life, the plant life. The animal life is for redeeming, and the plant life is for generating, producing. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cyngjkmdlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> In order to redeem us, there was the need for the second of the Godhead, with the aspect of the animal life signified by the onycha, to be slain on our behalf. The Lord Jesus was such a redeeming One. As the second of the Godhead, He accomplished redemption for us. This is the reason that the second spice, not the first or the third, has the animal life. The onycha, therefore, the second of the spices, surely signifies the second of the Trinity, the One who was crucified for our redemption. Neither the Father nor the Spirit died for the accomplishment of redemption. It was the Son who shed His blood on the cross so that we may be redeemed. Therefore, the three spices with onycha in the middle give us another portrait of the Triune God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzl1iJ92EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA">Humanity</h2><p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc5pDOvN1w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> Where do we see humanity signified by the ingredients of the incense? Humanity is indicated by the number four implied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37741" data-verses="Exodus 30:34">verse 34</span>. Here we have three spices and pure frankincense, a total of four items. We have seen that in the Bible the number four signifies the creature, humanity in particular. Therefore, the four items used for the composition of the incense signify humanity. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC83U4-H5C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO">The Resurrection of Christ</h2><p data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTfPDwBAX1FgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O"> With the incense we can also see the resurrection of Christ. With the ointment Christ’s resurrection is signified by the calamus and the cassia. But with the incense His resurrection is signified by frankincense. Hence, with both the ointment and the incense we have Christ’s death and resurrection. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4CJu1J3Rnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF">The Picture of a Wonderful Person</h2><p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9AI4CPoSQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> With the ointment and incense we see the Triune God, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1790" id="1790">[1790]</span> divinity, humanity, and Christ’s death and resurrection. In both we see divinity mingled with humanity. In both we see the Triune God in man passing through death and coming forth in resurrection. In both we have the numbers three and four signifying divinity and humanity. With the incense the three spices signify Christ’s death for generating and redeeming, and the frankincense signifies His resurrection. This means that with the incense we have a picture of the wonderful Person of Christ. The incense is nothing less than Christ Himself with all the process through which He has passed and with all He has accomplished. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl60PqlOIvIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> With the composition of both the anointing oil and the incense the principle is nearly the same. However, the anointing oil is for God’s coming to us, and the incense is for our going to God. In the anointing we have the Trinity, divinity, humanity, and the death and resurrection of Christ. In the incense we also have the Trinity, divinity, humanity, and Christ’s death and resurrection. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yM_kYd0c9qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS">OILED AND SALTED</h2><p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9NLSfLjaRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> Eventually, in both the anointing oil and the incense we have the number five. With the ointment, the four spices are blended with olive oil to give us the number five. But with the incense four elements, the three spices and the frankincense, are tempered with salt to give the number five. With the ointment the tempering element is oil, but with the incense the tempering element is salt. This means that God’s coming to us is a matter of our being oiled, but our going to God is a matter of our being salted. </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldTwj89F8JlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> Why is it that when God comes to us there is an abundance of oil, but no salt? The reason is that with God there is nothing unclean. He comes to us from a pure source. However, our source is full of uncleanness. Therefore, our going to God requires salt in place of oil. Salt is a substance that is pure even though it is found in an unclean place. Salt is one of the most pure substances on earth. The tempering of the four elements of the incense with salt indicates that our prayer needs to be thoroughly salted so that all the “germs” may be killed and we may be purified. The salting element is also the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1791" id="1791">[1791]</span> element that tempers our prayer. Thank the Lord that He does not come to us with salt. It would be most unpleasant if He came to us with a large quantity of salt instead of an abundance of oil. But praise Him that when we go to God we are salted, seasoned, tempered! </p>

<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbEMN9gPpHhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> In the first message on the incense we considered the two-way traffic between God and us and between us and God. We saw that the ointment typifies God coming to us in Christ and through Christ, and the incense typifies our going to God in Christ and through Christ. In the second message on the incense we pointed out that with both the ointment and the incense we see the Triune God, divinity, humanity, and Christ’s death and resurrection. We also saw that for the experience of God coming to us in Christ the oil is needed, but for the experience of our going to God in Christ the salt is needed. This means our prayers need to be salted by the effective death of Christ. In the previous message we strongly emphasized our need to have our prayers purified by the salt so that we may offer fragrant incense to God for His satisfaction. Let us now go on to consider the elements of the incense. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0WWwMJox8Wf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6">FRAGRANT SPICES</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcLCTIAS6zJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej">Stacte </h2>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h5AkgIc8l6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> The first of the fragrant spices used to make the incense is stacte. The Hebrew word for stacte is <em>nataph.</em> It signifies myrrh, a resinous gum used as purest myrrh. Hence, stacte is another kind of myrrh and signifies the sweet death of Christ. We should remember that the first spice in the anointing oil was also myrrh. This indicates that both for God’s coming to us and for our going to God a basic need is the death of Christ. Without the death of Christ, it would be impossible for us to go to God. Furthermore, it would even be <span class="pg" data-page-id="1796" id="1796">[1796]</span> impossible for God to come to us. This was the reason the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, “It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37745" data-verses="John 16:7">John 16:7</span>). The Lord’s word indicates that if He did not “go away” by dying on the cross for the accomplishment of redemption, there would be no way for God to come into us. When the Lord Jesus was with the disciples, God was present with them. But this was only a partial coming of God to the disciples. While the Lord Jesus was with His disciples in the flesh, God had come to man only halfway. He did not yet have the way to enter into His disciples. Therefore, the Lord had to go away; that is, He had to pass through death to open the way for God to come into fallen man. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9MgqplJQHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> The root of the Hebrew word for stacte, <em>nataph,</em> means drop (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37746" data-verses="Job 29:22">Job 29:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37747" data-verses="Song of Songs 4:11">S.S. 4:11</span>; see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37748" data-verses="Luke 4:22">Luke 4:22</span>). We have already pointed out that the myrrh used as an ingredient in the anointing oil has the appearance of tears when it issues out from the tree. Now we see that the root of the Hebrew word for stacte means drop. This is very significant. It indicates that the Lord Jesus shed many tears in His human life. As He walked on earth experiencing the myrrh, He shed many tears. Even as He was ministering, inwardly there was the “dropping” of tears. On the cross there was a great dropping of the Lord’s human life, His soulish life. Because of this, there can be the myrrh, the stacte, as the first element of the incense. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCr-pBwZfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR">Onycha</h2><p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLX_HkqvJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> The Hebrew word rendered onycha is <em>shecheleth.</em> This word denotes the shell of a little animal that grows in the marshes of the Red Sea, a shell that is good for medicine and is also used as a spice. This signifies that Christ with His redemptive life died for sinners. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG_iuRr9fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> In order for us to be redeemed, there was the need for the second of the Godhead, signified by onycha, to be slain on our behalf. Onycha grows in the marshes of the Red Sea, which signifies the corrupted world. The Lord Jesus became a little “animal” living in the marshes of this corrupted world for <span class="pg" data-page-id="1797" id="1797">[1797]</span> thirty-three and a half years. This is the Christ who was crucified to redeem us. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNC8i00PaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> As we have pointed out, the animal life typifies the redeeming aspect of Christ’s life. Therefore, not only does the onycha indicate the death of Christ; it also indicates that the Lord Jesus has a redemptive life and that He lived a redemptive life for us. Then on the cross His redemptive life was given for sinners. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0qzsMx6qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p">Galbanum</h2><p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBe94HDaKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> The Hebrew word for galbanum is <em>chelebnah.</em> This denotes a resinous gum. As the third element in the incense, galbanum signifies the powerful death of Christ’s generating life. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf8u8boqQmndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> The root of the Hebrew word for galbanum means fat, and the word ending means weeping. Fat signifies that Christ lived a life that was absolutely for God. This is the significance of the fat of the burnt offering. While He lived such a life absolutely for God, Christ wept for those who were not for God. On the one hand, He Himself lived a life absolutely for God; on the other hand, He wept for those who did not care for God. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeUPLWzpNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> The odor of galbanum as a resinous gum was exceedingly strong, disagreeable, unpleasant, and offensive. This unpleasant odor has three strange functions. First, although by itself it is offensive, it strengthens the fragrance of the other odors. When this spice is added to the other spices, the fragrance of the other spices is increased. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bRLhnNEJXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He certainly was offensive to the Pharisees and Sadducees. His rebuke of the Pharisees offended them to the uttermost. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37749" data-verses="Matthew 23:33">Matthew 23:33</span>, He called them “serpents, brood of vipers.” How strong and offensive the Lord was! Nevertheless, as the galbanum, He strengthened the fragrance of the other odors. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJp3fe-9VCqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> Myrrh is fragrant, and onycha gives off a pleasant fragrance when it is burned. The more onycha is burned, the more pleasant is its fragrance. Therefore, both myrrh and onycha have a sweet fragrance. But when galbanum is added <span class="pg" data-page-id="1798" id="1798">[1798]</span> to these spices, the offensive odor of the galbanum strengthens the sweet fragrance of the myrrh and the onycha. </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRE5IagljWTX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> The second function of the galbanum was to cause the fragrance of the incense to remain and endure. In other words, it enabled the incense to retain its fragrance for a longer time. Therefore, the galbanum not only strengthens the fragrance of the other spices; it also causes the incense to retain its fragrance. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJziBVSdtP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> Third, the galbanum functions as a repellent. It repels and expels noxious insects and poisonous reptiles, including serpents. In itself galbanum is noxious. It is used to repel and expel insects and poisonous reptiles and snakes. This is especially true of the “old serpent, the Devil.” The galbanum indicates that the death of Christ expels the serpent. In a sense, Christ’s death is not pleasant, but it truly strengthens and preserves the other elements, and it expels the serpent. His death is a repellent; it has the repelling power to expel Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9fR5lNdkfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> From the picture in these verses we see that all three spices signify the death of Christ. In the essence of all the ingredients we have the death of Christ. The Triune God came into humanity to die in order to redeem us, to produce sons, and expel evil. The Triune God became a man to generate us as sons, to redeem us from the fall, and to expel all evil. </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfSF3mRwvPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> Whenever I consider the three spices used to make the incense, I am convinced once again that the Bible truly is something inspired by God and revealed by Him. Man’s wisdom is not able to compose such a record. No doubt, these words were written according to the inspiration and revelation of God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr8678Rre7p8JK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s">Frankincense</h2><p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnlYMNUOGh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> Frankincense is a white resinous gum signifying the sweet resurrection of Christ. The root of the Hebrew word for frankincense means white. Furthermore, there are five kinds of gum-producing trees from which frankincense is derived, and these trees have flowers of five petals and fruits of five sides. This signifies responsibility in resurrection with the Trinity. It is also interesting to note that within the flowers of these <span class="pg" data-page-id="1799" id="1799">[1799]</span> trees are five pistils and five stamens. Therefore, with the tree that produces frankincense we see the number five again and again. We see this number with the kinds of trees, with the five petals on the flowers, with the five stamens and five pistils within the flowers, and with fruits of five sides. All this is related to the significance of the frankincense. </p>

<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqD8hB-nyUXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> Today God’s dwelling place is the church. The building up of the church is truly a great matter and a very important subject in the Bible. Over a long period of time, I have often spoken with the leading brothers in Anaheim concerning the building up of the church. This is a heavy burden on our heart. But we are not able to say much with clarity regarding how to build up the church in a locality. Even though I have studied the book of Exodus a number of times, I did not have a clear understanding from this book about the way to build the dwelling place of God on earth. For this reason, I appreciate the record in Exodus that speaks of the workers of the tabernacle. This is the unique record in the entire Bible showing us the detailed way for God’s people to build up His dwelling place on earth in this age. Therefore, we should treasure this record. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XgJuYeKO1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-">THE MASTER BUILDER</h2><p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc5oBOvN3w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37767" data-verses="Exodus 31:2-5">Exodus 31:2-5</span> speaks of the master builder of the tabernacle.

The name Bezalel means “in the shadow of God.” This indicates that as a master builder, Bezalel was altogether under God’s shadowing. He was a man under the shadow of God’s grace. This corresponds to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37770" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:10">1 Corinthians 3:10</span>, where he says that it was by God’s grace that he was made a wise master builder. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4DLu1K3xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> All of us, whether we are leaders in God’s building or common builders, need God’s grace. We need to be under the shadow of His grace. If we are not under the shadow of God’s grace, many things may come to disturb us. But the shadow of God will keep these things away from us and cause us to remain in a peaceful situation and condition to do the building work. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9BK4CMpyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> Regarding the building up of God’s dwelling place, there is a real conflict, a severe fighting between God and His enemy. The enemy does not like to see the building of God’s dwelling place going on in a good way. Therefore, he will do everything he can to interrupt, interfere, frustrate, attack, and destroy. The leading brothers in the churches know that it is a troublesome matter to take care of a local church because the enemy often causes disturbances and frustrations. Certain things we know have been sent by the enemy purposely to damage the work of building. There is no logical reason for such things to happen. Nevertheless, they happen because they were caused by the enemy. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl72PqmPovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> Especially the elders must realize that in order to build up a local church we need to be under the shadow of our God. For <span class="pg" data-page-id="1805" id="1805">[1805]</span> the building of God’s dwelling place, we all should be named Bezalel. We all should be those under the shadow of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yN9kYe089qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> The name of Bezalel’s father was Uri, which means “light of Jehovah.” This name indicates that all the builders of God’s dwelling place should be not only under God’s shadow, but also full of the Lord’s light. </p>
<p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9MJSfIj6RI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> The name of Bezalel’s grandfather was Hur. Hur means “free, noble, white.” Not only should we be under God’s shadow and full of light, but we should be free and noble. Those who build God’s dwelling place are not low people. On the contrary, they are noble people doing a noble work. No other work is as noble as the building of God’s dwelling place. Furthermore, the builders of God’s dwelling place are “white,” that is, they are clean and pure. When we put together the meaning of the names Bezalel, Uri, and Hur, we can see what kind of person the builders of God’s dwelling place, especially the elders, must be. </p>

By our natural life and ability and in our natural man, we are not able to do this work. Nothing natural is capable of building God’s dwelling place. Only the Spirit of God can build His own dwelling place through us. We are the instruments, the means. The actual ability, capacity, strength, and power must be God Himself as the Spirit to us. </p>

It is difficult to explain the difference between wisdom, understanding, and knowledge. The Hebrew word rendered workmanship also means craftsmanship. For the building of God’s dwelling place, we need craftsmanship. It takes skill to be able to build even a small table. This skill, this workmanship, involves knowledge. But it is not sufficient to have only knowledge; we also need understanding and wisdom. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1806" id="1806">[1806]</span> </p>

But it takes understanding to know how to put the materials together to make an article of clothing. I know something about the suits I wear, but I do not have any understanding at all concerning how they are actually made. I may know the length of my sleeves and the kind of material used in making my suits, but I do not understand how a tailor goes about making them. I use this as an illustration of the difference between knowledge and understanding and of the fact that we may have knowledge but still be lacking in understanding. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-46azGe5Y6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> We may also take the matter of listening to messages as an illustration of the difference between knowledge and understanding. You may know all the verses used in a particular message. Nevertheless, although you know these verses and may even be able to recite many of them, if you put all the verses together, you may not have any understanding of them. For the understanding of the verses, you need to listen to the ministry of the Word. Then you will begin to have understanding as well as knowledge. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMBPKISje3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> In listening to a message we first may have the knowledge of the verses and then an understanding of what the verses mean. However, we may have both knowledge and understanding of verses, but still not have any revelation concerning them. Someone may say, “I know these verses, and I also understand them. But as far as I am concerned, there is nothing here for me to see.” But as a minister of the Word continues to open the Word to you, you eventually begin to see what is revealed in the verses being considered. This is a matter of wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbENPtgL6nhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> When Moses was with the Lord on the mountain, God showed him the design of the tabernacle and all the furniture and utensils. Moses learned the dimensions of the ark, the showbread table, the incense altar, and the bronze altar. He also learned what materials were to be used in making these things. But suppose Moses had said to certain ones of the children of Israel, “Here is a description of the design, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1807" id="1807">[1807]</span> dimensions, and material of the tabernacle and its furniture. Please go and make the tabernacle and all the furniture.” No one could carry out this work without knowledge, understanding, and wisdom. </p>

We saw that in the book of Exodus the master builder was Bezalel, who was filled with the Spirit of God in wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and all workmanship. We emphasized the fact that the building up of God’s dwelling place, the church, is a noble work to be done by all the saints. Because this work cannot be done in our natural life or natural ability, we all need to be filled with the Spirit of God in knowledge, understanding, wisdom, and workmanship. In this message we shall go on to consider more details related to the workers of the tabernacle, the furniture, and the priestly garment. </p>

We use gold, silver, and bronze. We have already seen that gold signifies the nature of God, the divine nature, that silver signifies Christ’s redemption, and that bronze signifies God’s righteous judgment. If we would build up the church, all the saints must know how to use the divine nature as the gold, the redemption of Christ as the silver, and God’s righteous judgment as the bronze. Most Christians today have no way to build up God’s dwelling place, because they do not know the gold, the silver, and the bronze, and they do not know how <span class="pg" data-page-id="1814" id="1814">[1814]</span> to use these materials. But by the Lord’s mercy, even the young people in the Lord’s recovery may know how to use the divine gold for the building up of the church in their locality. They may also know how to use silver and bronze in a practical way for the building up of the church. Even the young sisters should use these materials to build God’s dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bRKjnNMZne1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37784" data-verses="Exodus 31:5">Verse 5</span> speaks of “cutting of stones for setting.” Here setting equals building. The cutting of the stones, therefore, is for building up. To cut stones for setting is to help the saints to be transformed into stones and to be adjusted to fit into God’s building. We all need to know how to cut stones for setting. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeVNLWzrNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> Many Christian workers do not know how to cut stones for God’s building. But I am also concerned that even in the local churches some elders do not know how to cut stones for this purpose. I do not have the confidence that all the elders in the local churches in this country know how to cut stones for setting. If all the elders were able to do this work, I would be very happy in the Lord. However, my heart is heavy, for I am somewhat concerned that some elders do not know how to cut stones for the work of building. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bRKjnNELXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> This word about cutting stones for building is quite enlightening and exposing. This is a word of warning for us all. Even the young sisters should know how to cut stones for setting. When the young sisters are fellowshipping with one another, they should know how to help others to be transformed and to fit into God’s building. A certain sister may have experienced an amount of transformation. However, she may not yet fit into the building. Hence, there is the need for cutting. The proper setting of stones into a wall always requires cutting. Without the cutting, the stones would not be able to fit into the building. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJp2de--Viqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> We all need to be reminded that we are not cutting adobe or bricks; we are cutting precious stones, transformed materials, for the building of God’s dwelling place. I believe that most of the saints will be able to understand my word. </p>
<p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRE4Kagmj2TX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> The “carving of wood” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37785" data-verses="Exodus 31:5">verse 5</span> signifies dealing with our humanity. We are not to be either angels or spirits. God <span class="pg" data-page-id="1815" id="1815">[1815]</span> designed us to be human beings with a proper humanity, signified by wood. For the building up of the church, the elders, the serving ones, and all the brothers and sisters, including the young ones, should know how to “carve” humanity. This is a figure of speech to express the thought of working on the humanity of the saints for the sake of God’s building. We all need to learn to fellowship, in the meetings, and in spiritual contact with the saints to cut stones for setting and to carve wood. Both the cutting of stones and the carving of wood are for the building up of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJygBVRcNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> The brothers and sisters in the churches should not place the burden of the building up of the church only on the shoulders of the elders. It is altogether not fair to put the whole burden on them. The elders are not magicians. They cannot be expected to accomplish all the building work. Nevertheless, nearly all the saints somehow expect the elders to do this. This is a dream. Some would even propose that the number of elders in their locality be doubled. Whoever makes this proposal is one who puts too much of the burden upon the elders. If you suggest that we increase the number of elders, I would reply that you need to bear your part of the burden as one of the builders. Do not expect the elders to do all the work of building. The reason the church in your locality is not built up is that many of the saints are not doing their share of the building work. Do not blame the elders. Be assured that I stand with the elders absolutely. If you are tempted to say that the elders have not fulfilled their responsibility, you should first blame yourself for not fulfilling your responsibility. I would urge you to forget about what the elders should do and to take care of your part in the building work. </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9eT5lOcEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> For years it has been my practice to encourage the saints to take responsibility to do what needs to be done in the church life. For example, if a sister would come to me and complain that the ladies’ rest room needs to be cleaned, I would respond by encouraging her to clean it herself. Eventually, the word went out not to come to me with any complaints, because I would tell the complaining one to take care of the matter himself. The point here is that we all have a part in the work of building up the church. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1816" id="1816">[1816]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfTH3mSwPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE">To Work in All Workmanship</h2><p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr8679Tre4pcJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> To build up the dwelling place of God, in addition to the work in gold, silver, and bronze, in cutting the stones, and in carving the wood, there is the need of the work in all workmanship, such as spinning, weaving, embroidery, and work on the animal skins, etc. These are the works to produce finer virtues in human character with the uplifted humanity of Christ, which are needed for the building up of the church as God’s dwelling place. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnkaMNXNmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2">THE CO-MASTER BUILDER</h2><p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH9rDasbW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37786" data-verses="Exodus 31:6">Verse 6</span> speaks of Bezalel’s co-master builder: “And I, behold, I have given with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.” The name Oholiab means the tent or tabernacle of my father. This signifies that one’s whole person cares for God’s tabernacle. Ahisamach, the name of Oholiab’s father, means a brother of strength or support. This co-master worker was a man for the tabernacle of God with strength and support. However, this co-master builder was of the tribe of Dan, the tribe of the lowest estate. The first master builder, Bezalel, was of the tribe of Judah. Judah is a kingly tribe, the tribe of the Lord Jesus. But the second master builder, Oholiab, came from the lowest tribe, the tribe of Dan. This indicates that the building work must include those of both the high estate and the low estate. No matter whether you are high or low, as long as you are one of God’s children, you must be included in the work of building. </p>

We all know that keeping the Sabbath is one of the Ten Commandments, the fourth commandment. We need to find out why this particular commandment is repeated after the record concerning the full revelation of God’s dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnka8NQdGh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> The last verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37801" data-verses="Exodus 31:1">chapter thirty-one</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37802" data-verses="Exodus 31:18">verse 18</span>, tells us that the Lord gave to Moses two tablets of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God. This verse concludes a long section that began no later than <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37803" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">chapter twenty</span>. When the Lord called Moses to go up to the mountain, the Lord first gave Moses the law. Then He gave Moses the revelation concerning the building up of His dwelling place on earth. In this section we see the design of the tabernacle and its furniture and a full revelation regarding the priesthood. There is also a record concerning the builders of the tabernacle. After all this, the Lord repeats the requirement related to keeping the Sabbath. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH9rzaqLm2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> The six verses about keeping the Sabbath, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37804" data-verses="Exodus 31:12-17">31:12-17</span>, are inserted between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37805" data-verses="Exodus 31:11">verses 11</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37806" data-verses="Exodus 31:18">18</span> of this chapter. What is the reason for this insertion? The reason for repeating the record of the Sabbath after the charge for the building work of the tabernacle is the first matter we need to cover in this message (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37807" data-verses="Exodus 20:8-11">20:8-11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzIJNMDQ1RdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> The fact that this insertion concerning the Sabbath follows the charge for the building work of the tabernacle <span class="pg" data-page-id="1822" id="1822">[1822]</span> indicates that the Lord was telling these builders, these workers, to learn how to rest with Him. They should not work and forget about resting with the Lord. Therefore, in charging them to do the work of building His dwelling place, the Lord reminded them that as they worked for Him, they should learn how to rest with Him. If we only know how to work for the Lord but do not know how to rest with Him, we are acting contrary to the divine principle. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAue_B6MOT0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> There has been much debate among Christians about the Sabbath, especially whether the Sabbath should be observed on the seventh day or on the eighth day. The Seventh-Day Adventists insist on keeping the Sabbath on the seventh day. Actually, the principle of the Sabbath is not a matter of the day on which it is observed. The principle of the Sabbath is that working with the Lord requires that we learn how to rest with Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldSyD8-EcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SABBATH</h2><p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6eOQcLwIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> Some may think that the significance of the Sabbath is merely to cease from work. This is not the real meaning of the Sabbath in the Bible. The Bible emphasizes the fact that God rested on the seventh day. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37808" data-verses="Genesis 2:2">Genesis 2:2</span> says, “And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.” </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cBxuO1TYwWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> According to the book of Genesis, to God the Sabbath is the seventh day, but to man it is the first day. In six days God created the heavens, the earth, and everything necessary for man to exist for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. After all things were made, man was created on the sixth day. This means that as soon as man came forth from the creating hand of God, his first day, which was God’s seventh day, was about to begin. Thus, what was the seventh day to God was the first day to man. The significance of this is that to God the Sabbath was rest after work, but to man it was rest first and then work. God first worked for six days and then He rested on the seventh day. But man rested on his first day and then began to work. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1823" id="1823">[1823]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUXl5OAE5AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ">God’s Refreshment</h2><p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-466zFfZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> I am happy that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37809" data-verses="Exodus 31:17">Exodus 31:17</span> tells us that “on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.” This indicates that the Sabbath was not only a rest to God, but was also a refreshment to Him. Both Genesis and Exodus tell us that God rested on the seventh day. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37810" data-verses="Exodus 31:17">31:17</span> the words “and was refreshed” are added. This reveals that even God needs to be refreshed. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMBPqIRi-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> To rest is one thing, but to be refreshed is something further. For us to rest we do not need anything in particular. It is sufficient either to sit down or to lie down. But to be refreshed we need something to eat or drink. We often refer to food and drink as refreshment. The point here is that if we would be refreshed, we need something to be a refreshment to us. The same is true of God. God needs something to refresh Him. Do you know what God’s refreshment is? What is it that refreshes God? </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbENPNgI6HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> Perhaps you have read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37811" data-verses="Exodus 31:1">Exodus 31</span> a number of times without ever being impressed by the fact that God needs to be refreshed. I can testify that I have expounded the book of Exodus more than once, but only recently have I seen the significance of the word “refreshed” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37812" data-verses="Exodus 31:17">31:17</span>. The Bible reveals that after God’s work of creation was completed, He rested and was refreshed. On what did God rest? He rested on His creation. To illustrate, suppose a craftsman spends a long time making a very special chair. When his work is finished, he may rest on the very chair he has made, enjoying it and thinking about it. I often experience this kind of rest after I have finished my work of writing. When I have finished writing something, I may sit back, look at what I have written, and enjoy it. I particularly enjoy the light I have received from the Lord through His Word. Likewise, sisters who make their own clothing may enjoy a good rest after they have finished making a particular garment. In the same principle, after God created man, He rested. He could look upon His handiwork, at the heavens, the earth, and all the living things, especially at man, and say, “Very good!” Then God could rest and be refreshed. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1824" id="1824">[1824]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0WXy8JuisWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> With what was God refreshed? God was refreshed with man. Man was God’s refreshment. God loved man. He created him in His own image with a spirit so that man could have fellowship with Him. Man, therefore, was God’s refreshment. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcKAjIJCazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37813" data-verses="Genesis 2:18">Genesis 2:18</span>, God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.” This word has a significance in typology, and indicates that it was not good for God to be alone. Before God created man, God could be compared to a bachelor. Some may criticize us for using the word bachelor to speak of our holy God. But I believe that God is happy to hear this word used with respect to Himself. Perhaps God would say, “My child, this word touches My heart. I truly was a bachelor before I created mankind.” The Bible reveals that in eternity past God was a “bachelor.” But in eternity future He will have a wife, the New Jerusalem, which is called the Lamb’s wife (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37814" data-verses="Revelation 21:9-10">Rev. 21:9-10</span>). Therefore, according to the revelation of the Bible that the New Jerusalem is the wife of the Lamb, I have the boldness to use the word bachelor with respect to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h4CUgAMMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> When God saw the man created by Him, He could rest and be refreshed. Man was like a refreshing drink to quench God’s thirst and satisfy Him. When God ended His work and began to rest, He had man as His companion. To God, the seventh day was a day of rest and refreshment. However, to man, God’s companion, the day of rest and refreshment was the first day. Man’s first day was a day of enjoyment. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFnvz7xNlB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s">A Divine Principle</h2><p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_FjsTj-q8k5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> It is a divine principle that God does not ask us to work until we have had enjoyment. God first supplies us with enjoyment. Then after a full enjoyment with Him and of Him, we may work together with Him. If we do not know how to have enjoyment with God and how to enjoy God Himself, we shall not know how to work with Him. We shall not know how to be one with God in His divine work. </p>

In this message we shall seek to find out the principles implied in this story. In the past we have pointed out that in studying the Bible, a basic need is to touch the spirit of the writer expressed in his writing. Now I would add that it is also important to discover the principles implied in any portion of the Word. In the account in Exodus regarding the making of the golden calf there are a number of basic principles. Our main concern in this message will be to see the principles related to worshipping the golden calf. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjM0AKi2js7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E">THE WAY OF GRACE PREPARED<br/>BEFORE THE LAW WAS BROKEN</h2><p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wJ0sG3Ms_l3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> After the decree of the law and before the breaking of it, God called Moses to His mount to give him the tablets of the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37822" data-verses="Exodus 24:12">24:12</span>). The Lord called Moses to Mount Sinai first in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37823" data-verses="Exodus 19:20">Exodus 19:20</span>. That was the time the Lord gave Moses the law of the Ten Commandments with all the subordinate ordinances. Then, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37824" data-verses="Exodus 24:12">24:12</span>, the Lord called Moses to go to the mountain again. The Lord wanted to give him the tablets of the law. The law had been decreed, but the tablets of the Ten Commandments had not yet been given to Moses. The tablets of the law were given to Moses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37825" data-verses="Exodus 31:18">31:18</span>: “And He gave to Moses, when He finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.” </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8dpa-AwKTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> Both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37826" data-verses="Exodus 24:12">24:12</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37827" data-verses="Exodus 31:18">31:18</span> refer to the giving of the tablets of the law. But between these verses is a long insertion of seven <span class="pg" data-page-id="1834" id="1834">[1834]</span> chapters. This indicates that after the Lord called Moses to the mountain for the purpose of giving him the tablets of the law, He first spoke to him about other things. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37828" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">chapters twenty-five through thirty-one</span> the Lord revealed to Moses the design of the tabernacle and its furniture, and He spoke to him concerning matters related to the priesthood. We have seen that the tabernacle and the priesthood typify Christ. The tabernacle with its furniture typifies Christ, and the priesthood with the garments and the priestly food are also detailed types of Christ. If we would know Christ, we need to study <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37829" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">chapters twenty-five through thirty-one</span> of Exodus. God’s intention in calling Moses to the mountain was to give him the tablets of the law. But before giving Moses these tablets, God first gave him the design of the tabernacle and instructions concerning the priesthood. Only then did the Lord give Moses the tablets. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5D5HHAVIFazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> The fact that God showed Moses the tabernacle with its furniture and the priesthood before giving him the tablets of the law indicates that while God was giving the law, He knew that man could not keep it. This also indicates that God had prepared the way of grace for man to contact Him and enjoy Him. The way of grace is Christ typified by the tabernacle and the priesthood. God prepared Christ as the way of grace for man to contact God and enjoy Him. While God was giving the law, He knew that man would not be able to keep it; therefore, He prepared this way of grace. Christ is our tabernacle, the offerings, and all the aspects of the priesthood. The writings of John reveal that Christ is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnkasNXPmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> After showing Moses the tabernacle and the priesthood, God gave him the two tablets of the law. God could do this in peace, even though He knew that the law would be broken. God was not troubled by this, because, before the law was broken, God had already prepared the way of grace so that man would be able to contact God and enjoy Him. It was not God’s intention, therefore, to trust in the law; His trust was in Christ as the prepared way of grace. Even though God was giving the law, He did not have any trust in the law. God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="1835" id="1835">[1835]</span> trust was, and still is, absolutely in His Christ as the tabernacle and the priesthood. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPH9rjasZW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg"> I believe that Moses was happy to have the tablets of the law and that he put his trust in them. As he was coming down the mountain, he may have said to himself, “Oh, I have two stone tablets in my hands! On these tablets are words written by the finger of God.” No doubt, Moses treasured these tablets containing the law engraved in stone by God Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzIJNMTQ8DdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> Moses was on the mountain with God for a period of forty days. In the Bible forty is a number of testing and trial. For example, the Lord Jesus fasted in the wilderness for forty days. It is doubtful that the golden calf was made earlier than Moses’ thirty-sixth day on the mountain. It may have been made during the last two or three days, when the people could no longer bear to wait for Moses to come back. Some of them may have said, “The one whom we respected and who brought us out of Egypt and led us to this place has been gone for more than five weeks. He went up the mountain, and we do not know what has happened to him. We cannot wait any longer.” It may have been that at the very time God was giving the tablets to Moses, to the mediator, the people at the foot of the mountain were making the golden calf. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAue_R6EcD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK">THE BREAKING OF THE LAW THROUGH IDOLATRY</h2><p data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw3-XBFLLMBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw"> Now we come to the breaking of the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37830" data-verses="Exodus 32:1-20">32:1-20</span>). Why is it that we human beings cannot keep the law but break it instead? The answer to this question involves an important principle. The principle here is that we break the law because we have idols. Everyone has his own idol. There is no need for us deliberately to try to break the law of God. As long as we have an idol, the first three commandments of the law are already broken. The first three commandments are related to not having any other god, not making images, and not using the Lord’s name in vain. These commandments are all related to God. The fourth commandment concerns the Sabbath, and the last six commandments involve our relationships with others. The first three commandments are broken by everyone who has an idol. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZwOzx29KYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> We cannot keep the law because we have idols. If we have <span class="pg" data-page-id="1836" id="1836">[1836]</span> God and allow no idols to replace Him, the very God whom we enjoy will become to us the ability to keep His commandments. As a result, we shall keep the law of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneDNNt7LUHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> This principle is seen in John’s writings. Both in the Gospel of John and in the first Epistle of John we are charged to keep the commandments. We are able to fulfill this charge because, according to the New Testament, we have the Lord within us as our enjoyment. Not only is the indwelling Christ who becomes our enjoyment the strength to keep the law, but the enjoyment of Christ is itself the keeping of the law. This means that the indwelling Christ becoming our enjoyment is actually the keeping of the commandments. There is no need for us to try in ourselves to keep the commandments. Our enjoyment of the indwelling Christ spontaneously becomes the keeping of the commandments. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbouyVQhwzAoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> Why are human beings not able to keep the law? People cannot keep the law because they have idols that replace God. But as we have pointed out, if we have God and do not allow idols to replace Him, the God we have and enjoy will be the strength to keep the law. In fact, God Himself as our enjoyment is the real keeping of the law. If we have God in us as our enjoyment, we would never have another god, we would never make an image, and we would not take God’s name in vain. We would rest with God, and we would honor our parents. Furthermore, we would not murder, commit fornication, steal, lie, or bear false witness. And we would not be greedy, covetous. We would keep all the commandments of the law, and this keeping of the law would actually be the experience of the indwelling God becoming our enjoyment. This is the first principle we see in the account in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37831" data-verses="Exodus 32:1">Exodus 32</span> of the breaking of the law. </p>

<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzk2iJ5lUyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that in reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37856" data-verses="Exodus 32:1">chapter thirty-two</span> of Exodus we need to find out the principles implied in this record. Before we go on to consider the matter of the dealing with the idol and the idolaters, we need to consider the principle of the golden-calf idol. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc5oAOvKlQ9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> Although there were idol worshippers in Genesis, the worship of the idol in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37857" data-verses="Exodus 32:1">Exodus 32</span> is unique. At least two million people had been rescued out of the hand of Pharaoh and brought out of the land of tyranny. They crossed the Red Sea and passed through the wilderness. These people had witnessed many great miracles done for them by God. Even in the days when they were making the idol and worshipping it, they still gathered the manna that came down from the heavens. They were in a situation under God’s miraculous care. Nevertheless, they made an idol and worshipped it as the very God who had brought them out of Egypt and led them to Mount Sinai. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC82X4-Bpy81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> Moses had already gone up the mountain once and descended. All the people knew about this. Moses must have told them something concerning the decree of God’s law. I believe that, at least, Moses must have spoken to the people about the Ten Commandments. Then Moses was called back to the mount and stayed there for forty days. According to the context, the idol, the golden calf, was not made in the earlier part of these forty days. As we mentioned already, the golden calf was probably made toward the end of these forty days. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTfOAwBKFVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O">TWO SCENES</h2><p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4DKu1Clhnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37858" data-verses="Exodus 32:1">Exodus 32</span> we have two scenes: one on the mountain and the other at the foot of the mountain. The scene on the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1846" id="1846">[1846]</span> mountain was wonderful. Here the design of the tabernacle and its furniture was given to Moses. It may have been that while God was inscribing the law on the tablets of stone with His finger, Aaron and his helpers were making the golden calf at the foot of the mountain. In the scene at the top of the mountain, the inscribing of the law was taking place. But in the scene at the foot of the mountain, the fashioning of an idol was taking place. The comparison here is very significant. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcKBDIJAazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> The situation of God’s people today can be compared to that of the children of Israel at Mount Sinai. The Lord Jesus has gone into the heavens, where He is today. In the heavens the Lord reveals the design concerning God’s dwelling place on earth. In the Old Testament Moses was on the mount. But according to the New Testament, the Lord Jesus is now in the heavens. If you read the book of Hebrews carefully, you will see that Moses’ experience on Mount Sinai was a type. What was revealed to Moses concerning the tabernacle was a type of today’s revelation concerning God’s dwelling place. This is true especially regarding the matter of the priesthood. The priesthood revealed to Moses was a type of the New Testament priesthood revealed through the Lord Jesus in the heavens. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h4D0gAOMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> While Moses was tarrying on the mountain, God’s people began to worship the golden-calf idol. In principle, the situation is the same today among Christians. What is happening on earth among Christians while the Lord Jesus is tarrying in the heavens? Golden calves are being fashioned and worshipped by God’s people. The situation at the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37859" data-verses="Exodus 32:1">Exodus 32</span> and the situation among God’s people today are very similar. In fact, today’s situation is almost a copy of what happened in the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFnuT7yNFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> Moses received a revelation concerning the tabernacle for God’s dwelling place and the priesthood for God’s service. Likewise, after the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens, He gave the revelation concerning the dwelling place of God and God’s priesthood. In writing the various New Testament books, apostles such as Paul, Peter, and John were working together with the Christ in heaven to reveal God’s design. As we read the New Testament Epistles, we can see the pattern <span class="pg" data-page-id="1847" id="1847">[1847]</span> and design of God’s dwelling place and His priesthood. In the Epistles of Paul, Peter, and John we can see the pattern of the tabernacle, the ark, the lampstand, the showbread table, the incense altar, the bronze altar, the laver, and all the utensils related to the dwelling place of God. Moreover, in all these Epistles we can also see the priesthood. This revelation has been given in the heavens. But at the bottom of the mountain Christians are making a golden calf. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Fjtzj9qck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X">MIXTURE IN WORSHIP</h2><p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_CjZ16fsZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> It is important for us to see that the worship of the golden calf in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37860" data-verses="Exodus 32:1">Exodus 32</span> was a mixture. It was an idol that was worshipped, but it was worshipped in the way that God’s people were supposed to worship God. This is a common practice among many Christians today. Christians may worship in the way that is suitable to the worship of God, but actually the object of their worship may be something other than God. If we have a clear, heavenly view, we shall realize that much of the worship among Christians today is a mixture. Something that pretends to be God is worshipped as if it were actually God Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQezRdszxAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> After Aaron made the golden calf, the people said, “This is your God, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37861" data-verses="Exodus 32:4">Exo. 32:4</span>). The people worshipped the golden calf as if it were the very God who had brought them out of Egypt. Was that not a mixture? Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37862" data-verses="Exodus 32:5-6">32:5 and 6</span> say, “And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation and said, A feast to Jehovah—tomorrow! And they rose up early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings.” Here we see that an altar was built before the idol, and the people offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings. This indicates that they worshipped the idol in the way that they were supposed to worship God. That was utterly a mixture. In other words, that worship was not pure. We can compare the worship among Christians today with that of the children of Israel at Mount Sinai. The worship of the golden calf by the children of Israel is a picture of the impure worship among Christians today. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1848" id="1848">[1848]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755T2_TLj99jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> The worship of the golden calf was different from the pagan worship of idols. The golden calf was worshipped by a redeemed people in the name of the Lord their Redeemer. After the golden calf was made, the people declared that it was the Lord who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. This indicates that they worshipped an idol in the name of Jehovah their God. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoACoCjw6AePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> Furthermore, they worshipped that idol in the way they should have worshipped God, that is, in the way ordained by God. They offered to the idol the kind of offerings that they should have offered to God. This is a shameful mixture. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyNhu_KGJvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> People would easily condemn the pagan worship of idols. But in its present-day expression it is not easy for anyone to condemn the kind of impure worship we see in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37863" data-verses="Exodus 32:1">Exodus 32</span>, a worship that is full of mixture. Do you have the assurance that the so-called worship services that take place in today’s cathedrals and chapels are a pure worship of God? Is it really God who is being worshipped? If God is not the One who is being worshipped, then who is the object of worship? If the worship is not purely the worship of God, it must be the worship of something other than God. Holy songs may be sung to God and prayers may be offered to God, but actually the worship is to someone or something other than God. </p>

<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-47KzMM5Y6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> Moses was not the first to know that the children of Israel were practicing idolatry at the foot of the mountain. It was God who told Moses about this: “And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Go! Get down, for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37877" data-verses="Exodus 32:7">v. 7</span>). God specifically told Moses that the people had corrupted themselves. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMBOaIZxO3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> Do you believe that there are groups of Christians on earth today who have not corrupted themselves? The elements used by the enemy of God to corrupt Christians are the idols. Idols are corrupting factors. Nothing corrupts us more than idols. Whatever you love more than God is an idol, and that thing corrupts you. Once you have been corrupted by an idol, many sinful things will come in. If we love a certain thing more than God, that will become a factor of our corruption. This will be followed by sins. Therefore, we need to be careful not to corrupt ourselves by having idols, by having things that we love more than God. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83AvBavySXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> Concerning the idolatrous people, the Lord went on to tell Moses, “They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them; they have made for themselves a molten calf, and have bowed themselves down to it and have sacrificed to it; and they said, This is your god, O Israel, who <span class="pg" data-page-id="1856" id="1856">[1856]</span> brought you up out of the land of Egypt” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37878" data-verses="Exodus 32:8">v. 8</span>). The children of Israel had been under God’s dealings and training for approximately a year. They had seen many miracles performed by God. It is difficult to believe that they could have so quickly turned aside from God’s way. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCkaCYvSIvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> What is the situation of today’s Christians regarding God’s way? Christians have the Bible, but very few take God’s way. Instead, many have turned aside by making a golden calf and worshipping it. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjM0Bqixxs7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37879" data-verses="Exodus 32:9">verse 9</span>, the Lord also said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.” This means that the people were stubborn and were not willing to be subdued or convinced to have a change. Not only was their neck stiff, but their entire being was unbending. This is also the condition of many Christians today. Who can subdue those Christians who are worshipping a golden calf? Who can convince them to act otherwise? If you try to speak to them, they may condemn you as being heretical. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wJ0tm3K-vl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37880" data-verses="Exodus 32:10">verse 10</span> the Lord went on to say, “And now, let Me alone, that My anger may burn against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make you into a great nation.” This word indicates that God was considering that He would wipe out the children of Israel. He certainly would not have spoken this way to Moses to threaten him. The Lord surely meant what He said. He was thinking of preserving Moses and his family and of making of Moses a nation to fulfill His purpose and to fulfill His promise to the forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8do6-JjqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN">Moses’ Word of Petition</h2><p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5D4nHIG4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37881" data-verses="Exodus 32:11-13">32:11-13</span> we have Moses’ petition for the idolatrous people. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37882" data-verses="Exodus 32:11">Verse 11</span> says, “And Moses appeased the face of Jehovah his God, and he said, O Jehovah, why does Your anger burn against Your people whom You have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand?” The Hebrew word rendered “appeased” means to mollify, entreat the favor of. The literal meaning is to make the face of anyone sweet or pleasant. God had an angry expression on His face, and Moses was trying to appease God’s face, to make <span class="pg" data-page-id="1857" id="1857">[1857]</span> His face happy. Moses was trying to cause God to be in favor of the idolatrous people. This was Moses’ petition. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fSwV28TNcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> It seems that Moses was not tempted by God’s word about making him into a great nation. The Lord was saying that the people were hopeless, that He would consume them, and that He would make of Moses a great nation. If I had been there, I probably would have been tempted by this situation. It would be easy for us to say, “Amen, Lord. Whatever You say, Lord,” humbling ourselves somewhat. However, Moses did not give in to this kind of thought. Instead, he appeased God’s angry face for the favor of the idolatrous people. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vRoS9rhE6d_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37883" data-verses="Exodus 32:7">verse 7</span> the Lord said to Moses that the people were his people and that he had brought them out of the land of Egypt. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37884" data-verses="Exodus 32:11">verse 11</span> Moses asked the Lord, “Why does Your anger burn against Your people whom You have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand?” Here Moses seems to be saying, “Lord, You say that these are my people and that I brought them out of Egypt. But, Lord, this is Your people, not mine. You brought them out of the land of Egypt, not I. I did not have the strength to do that.” Moses was a true mediator, an ancient attorney, as he made his petition to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4brZo07WCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> Then Moses continued, “Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, With evil intent He has brought them out to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from Your fierce anger and repent concerning this evil toward Your people. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Yourself, and You spoke to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have spoken I will give to your seed, and they shall possess it forever” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37885" data-verses="Exodus 32:12-13">vv. 12-13</span>). Moses told the Lord that if He consumed His people, the Egyptians would slander Him. It was necessary for the Lord to take care of His name and not to allow Himself to be slandered by the Egyptians. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL53Zf6DP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> After saying this, Moses urged the Lord to repent, and then he reminded Him of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. Moses had a strong ground on which to pray. He stood upon God’s faithful word, the unchanging promise, that <span class="pg" data-page-id="1858" id="1858">[1858]</span> He had given to Moses’ forefathers as a covenant. Moses seemed to be saying, “Lord, if You consume this people, You will break Your word. You will break the covenant You made with our forefathers. Not only would You give ground to the Egyptians to slander You, but You would act contrary to Yourself. You are the faithful God, and You cannot swallow Your words.” </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cymjzklcFAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37886" data-verses="Exodus 32:14">Verse 14</span> indicates that Moses’ appeal was effective: “And Jehovah repented concerning the evil which He spoke of doing to His people.” We would never expect God to repent. But Moses was a very able petitioner. He was able to convince God that He should repent. Therefore, God changed His mind and decided not to consume the people. The expression in the Lord’s face changed from one of anger to one of pleasantness. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzk2yJ-3kyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> If we had been Moses, we would have acted differently. Once we heard words of anger spoken by the Lord, we might have run down to the bottom of the mountain to deal with the idolatrous people. But before Moses came down, he appeased the Lord. He settled the case in the heavenly lawcourt. Only then did he come down to deal with the idol and the idolaters. </p>

Aaron had used fire to shape the golden calf. But Moses used fire to destroy the calf. After burning the calf with fire, Moses ground it until it was powder. Then he scattered it upon the surface of the water and forced the sons of Israel to drink it. What is the significance of this? This signifies that eventually those who worship an idol must drink the very idol they worship. This can be compared to the saying that we reap what we sow, or that we eat the result of what we do. </p>

<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_CjZV6Y_5KauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> In this message we come to the record of a very particular matter, a record that reveals that Moses was a companion of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37903" data-verses="Exodus 32:30">32:30—33:23</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQezR9s1iwajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg">THE NEED OF A MEDIATOR</h2><p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755T2_zLqu9jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> The making of the golden calf was a severe blow to both God and Moses. Before the calf was made, everything was going smoothly. Moses was on the mountaintop with the Lord, and the Lord was revealing to him the design of the tabernacle and its furniture and utensils. No doubt, God and Moses were very happy. But at the end of the forty days Moses spent on the mountain with God, the children of Israel did evil in making a golden calf and worshipping it. By doing that, they broke the first four of the Ten Commandments. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoACoCDwyTOPzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> The worship of the golden calf caused a serious problem. What should God do? Should He give up the children of Israel? Should He forsake His purpose in bringing them out of Egypt? Surely God could not do this. If you had brought more than two million people out of Egypt, not according to your mood, but according to your promise, would you have been able to give them up? Certainly not. God delivered the children of Israel in order to fulfill His promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God brought the people out of Egypt, led them through the wilderness, and brought them to Mount Sinai, where He gave them training. Suddenly, as a great surprise, the children of Israel did evil by worshipping the golden calf. What the children of Israel did caused God a big <span class="pg" data-page-id="1864" id="1864">[1864]</span> problem. What should He do? In principle, we may have the assurance that God would not give up His people or abandon His project with them. On the contrary, He would still go on with them. But how could He go on with the children of Israel in such a situation? </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyNhufKGLvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> The problem God faced with His people can be compared to certain problems between husband and wife or between parents and children. Although a wife may cause her husband a serious problem, and although the children may cause their parents serious problems, the husband cannot give up the wife, and the parents cannot give up their children. There must be a way for the husband and wife and the parents and children to go on together. Likewise, it was necessary for God to find a way to go on with His people. He needed a way out of the problem that had arisen regarding them. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqD8gh-hgkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> God’s way out was through Moses as the middleman, the mediator. In order to be a middleman, a mediator, between God and the children of Israel, it was necessary for Moses to be intimately involved with both parties. Moses was uniquely qualified to be the mediator. He had had nothing to do with the worship of the golden calf. He had been kept from that evil thing and was preserved in the presence of God. Therefore, he was the only one among God’s people who was clean. Furthermore, Moses was very close to God. As we shall see, the way Moses expressed his petition to God indicates that his relationship with God was an intimate one. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDToyAys4YAr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> I believe that, deep in His heart, God expected Moses to come in as the mediator between Him and the people. It was God’s desire that Moses would give Him a way out of the problem. Without a middleman who could speak to God intimately, God would not have had a solution to His problem. No doubt, God wanted to be appeased. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37904" data-verses="Exodus 32:30">32:30</span> Moses indicated that propitiation was necessary: “And it came about on the next day that Moses said to the people, You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to Jehovah; perhaps I can make propitiation for your sin.” </p>
<p data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XgIOYWYe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-"> The offense caused by the children of Israel was extremely serious. What they did was inexcusable. They did not merely <span class="pg" data-page-id="1865" id="1865">[1865]</span> do something wrong; they made an idol and worshipped it as if it were God. They used the name of the Lord in vain. In so doing, they offended God to the uttermost, and it was as if they left no ground for Him to forgive them. It seemed that there was no possibility for God to come in to forgive this offense or to say anything to the people. Apparently, the only thing He could do was destroy the children of Israel there in the wilderness. Therefore, there was the need of a middleman, a mediator. How good that Moses was there to be the mediator between God and the children of Israel! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9MhpZlJRHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0">INTIMATE WITH GOD</h2><p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCq9ZBwYfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> At this point I would like to say to all the saints, especially the young people, that to serve the Lord is not simply a matter of a way or a method. Serving the Lord is something very personal. If we would serve the Lord, we must be a person who has an intimate relationship with Him. Otherwise, we may be good Christian workers, but we cannot be those who are able to touch God’s heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLW83kquJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> Moses was a man greatly used by God. In previous messages we have seen how Moses was raised up by God and trained by Him. Moses was raised up by God during the first forty years of his life, and he was trained by Him during the next forty years. When Moses was eighty years old, God came in to call him and use him. God gave him a vision of a burning bush (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37905" data-verses="Exodus 3:2">3:2</span>). Although the fire was burning in the bush, the bush was not consumed. Through this vision God seemed to be saying, “Moses, you are like this bush. I intend to use you, but I shall not burn you. I shall not consume you. I shall burn in you according to what I am.” </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG-heRr8fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> When Moses was called by God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37906" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span>, there was not yet any intimacy between him and God. Moses was new to God. Their relationship can be compared to that between an employer and a new employee. God, the employer, spoke to Moses, the new employee, and asked him if he would accept the job. We know that eventually Moses was convinced to take the “job” the Lord offered him. </p>
<p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyND_S00MaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> The period of time from the day Moses was called in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37907" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span> to the conversation between him and God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37908" data-verses="Exodus 32:1-2">Exodus 32 and 33</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="1866" id="1866">[1866]</span> was probably not more than two years. During the course of this period of time, Moses became intimate with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0rwcMx5qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> According to the record in Exodus, Moses twice spent a period of forty days alone with God on the mountaintop. During the first forty days, God gave Moses the design of the tabernacle and the furniture. This is described in six chapters, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37909" data-verses="Exodus 25:1-30">Exodus 25 through 30</span>. Do you think that the content of these six chapters occupied God for those entire forty days? This certainly would not seem to be the case. What were God and Moses doing all that time? They may have been enjoying intimate fellowship. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBf-IHAbqzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> The children of Israel may have tried to excuse themselves for making the golden calf by the fact that Moses was gone so long. Some of them may have said, “We have not heard from the Lord or from Moses for a long time. They have left us here at the foot of the mountain, and we have been here for nearly forty days. The Lord and Moses brought us out of Egypt and led us to this place. But we don’t know what has happened to them. We can’t see God, and we can’t see Moses either. Therefore, we must do something for ourselves.” God, of course, did not give the people a chance to excuse themselves. Likewise, Moses did not allow the children of Israel, especially Aaron, to make an excuse. If Aaron and the children of Israel had been allowed to excuse themselves, they probably would have blamed Moses for being gone too long. They may have said, “Moses, where have you been? You have been gone too long. Does the Lord intend to have us for His people, or does He plan to have only you? It seems to us that you and God have forgotten about us.” </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf8v_ropRGndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> We may say that the Lord and Moses stayed together so long because they were intimate with each other. They had a happy time together on the mountaintop. But that pleasant time was a time of testing to the children of Israel. Later God asked Moses to go up to the mountain again, and they were together for another forty days. Moses and God simply liked to stay together. They loved each other, and they wanted to be together. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1867" id="1867">[1867]</span> </p>

Moses and God were partners in a single enterprise. As God’s companion, Moses knew God’s heart and could converse with Him in an intimate way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnG-hORtvPiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ">MADE MANIFEST BY AND<br/>AMONG THE IDOLATROUS PEOPLE</h2><p data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyND_C09c6oTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB"> The fact that Moses was a companion of God was made manifest by the idolatrous people and among them. From this we who serve the saints in the churches may learn an important lesson. This lesson is never to blame the situation. The elders should not say, “Oh, all the brothers and sisters here are troublemakers. This makes it hard for us to go on. Let us resign, and let others come in to be the elders. Then they will taste how bitter it is to be an elder in this locality.” Sometimes this thought is in the heart of the elders. On a number of occasions I have heard elders speak in this way. </p>
<p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0rwMM5paQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> The elders need to see that how much we have been dealt with by the Lord and how much we have learned of the Lord will always be made manifest by the difficulties we face with the saints. It was the idolatrous people who made manifest Moses’ qualifications as God’s companion. Likewise, it will be troublesome saints who will create an opportunity for the Lord to manifest what He has done in us. If the elders only have to be involved with positive brothers and sisters, what the elders are would not be manifest. </p>
<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4brZI07UCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> The making of the golden calf was a severe blow to Moses. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1874" id="1874">[1874]</span> What should he do about the situation? This was determined by the kind of person he was. The evil situation among the children of Israel provided an opportunity for Moses to be manifested as a companion of God. </p>

And now I will go up to Jehovah; perhaps I can make propitiation for your sin.” Here we see that Moses was willing to make propitiation in behalf of a people who were stiff-necked and idolatrous. In a human sense, this required a great deal of patience. If you had been Moses, would you have been willing to appease God for the sake of such a rebellious people? If we had been there, we might have urged God to wipe out such a people. It requires patience to do the work of appeasing or propitiating. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzk2SJ93EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA">By Conversing with God Intimately</h2><p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc5oA-vN2w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> Moses sought to propitiate God by conversing with Him intimately. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37927" data-verses="Exodus 32:31">Exodus 32:31</span> says, “And Moses returned to Jehovah and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and they have made for themselves a god of gold.” Notice that Moses here uses the neutral expression “this people.” He does not say to the Lord “Your people”; neither does he refer to them as “my people.” God had said to Moses that it was Moses who had brought the people out of Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37928" data-verses="Exodus 32:7">32:7</span>). But Moses said to God that it was God who had brought them out (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37929" data-verses="Exodus 32:11">32:11</span>). But here Moses, following the way of a middleman, a mediator, uses a neutral expression and speaks neither of God’s people nor of his own people, but of “this people.” </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC82XI-H6C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> There is no record that Moses gave God a report of how he dealt with the idolatrous people. He did not tell God that he ground the calf into powder, scattered the powder on the water, and forced the people to drink the water. Neither did he tell the Lord that he had called for some to slaughter the idolaters. What we have is a friendly, intimate conversation between Moses and the Lord. Moses simply told God that the people had sinned a great sin in making a god of gold. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1875" id="1875">[1875]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTfOAABDWVFgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O">Interceding at the Risk of His Eternal Destiny</h2><p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4DKe1K2xnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> Moses sought to make propitiation for the people even at the risk of his eternal destiny. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37930" data-verses="Exodus 32:32">verse 32</span>, he said to the Lord, “And now, if You will forgive their sin—and if not, wipe me out, I pray, from Your book which You have written.” Notice that Moses did not complete the first part of his statement. He simply said, “If You will forgive their sin.” If we had been Moses, we may have said something like this: “Now, if You will forgive their sin, everything will be all right.” Moses, however, left the matter open. To indicate this, some translations use an ellipsis and say, “If You will forgive their sin....” Sometimes it is necessary to speak in this way to those close to us. In speaking to our husband or wife we may need to say, “If you will do this....” We should not always complete our thought. Moses spoke in such a way because he realized that he was not the Lord. Only the Lord is the Lord. Therefore, Moses did not presume to say what would be the result or consequence if the Lord forgave their sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9BLICMqyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> The latter part of Moses’ word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37931" data-verses="Exodus 32:32">verse 32</span> makes it clear that he was propitiating for the people at the risk of his spiritual destiny. He said to the Lord, “If not, wipe me out, I pray, from Your book which You have written.” It seems that Moses was saying, “Concerning my own destiny, Lord, I would ask you to wipe me out if you would not forgive this people. But I leave with You the question concerning the destiny of the people. Only you can say what their destiny should be.” </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl73_qmMovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> Do you think that Moses’ word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37932" data-verses="Exodus 32:31-32">verses 31 and 32</span> is an ordinary prayer? He did not pray in an ordinary way for the children of Israel; instead, he conversed with God intimately in their behalf. That was the wise way followed by Moses to appease God in that situation. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yN8UYd1c9qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS">According to God’s Heart</h2><p data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9MIifLiaRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9"> Moses made propitiation for the people according to God’s heart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37933" data-verses="Exodus 32:33">32:33—33:3</span>). From what the Lord says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37934" data-verses="Exodus 32:33">verse 33</span>, apparently He did not heed Moses’ word. Outwardly it may seem that God resisted Moses’ word, but inwardly He had already honored it. God was happy to have such a companion. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1876" id="1876">[1876]</span> God may have said to Himself, “I am glad to have Moses for a companion. He is intimate with Me, and He knows My heart and what I want to do. Moses knows that I want to forgive this people and continue to use them. However, I would not initiate this conversation in their behalf. But Moses, My companion, one who knows My heart, has initiated this talk.” </p>
<p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldSzT89E8JlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37935" data-verses="Exodus 32:33">verse 33</span> God said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against Me, I will wipe him out from My book.” This word was an outward expression to uphold God’s honor. But what the Lord goes on to say in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37936" data-verses="Exodus 32:34">verse 34</span> indicates that He had forgiven the people: “And now, go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, My angel shall go before you, and in the day of My visitation I will visit their sin upon them.” Moses, the mediator, realized that God’s word here was an indication that He had forgiven the people. Moses had said, “If You will forgive their sin....” It seems that he was saying to the Lord, “Lord, I won’t say anything further. You speak a word. Now You tell me to go lead the people to the place of which You have spoken to me. I have no problem with this.” </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6ePAcIwos4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> The King James Version and Darby’s translation capitalize the word angel in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37937" data-verses="Exodus 32:34">verse 34</span>. I agree with this, for it is an indication that the angel here is Christ. The Lord promised Moses that His angel would go before him, and in the day of His visitation He would visit the people’s sin upon them. On the one hand, the people were forgiven. But on the other hand, there was still a problem, and God said that He would deal with it. Sometimes the relationship between a father and his children is like this. The children may do something wrong, and the father will forgive them and release them. However, he may intend to deal with them in some way at a later time. </p>

<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJyiRVWPtP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37971" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Exodus 34</span> is a chapter that is not easy to understand. After we read through this chapter, we still may not be able to grasp what is spoken in it, because so many matters are covered. Therefore, at the beginning of this message I would like to point out two matters that may help our understanding of this chapter. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9eRplIP0fCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer">TYPES, FIGURES, AND SHADOWS</h2><p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfTFnmbjPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> The first is that when we, the New Testament believers, read the Old Testament, especially certain books, we need to realize that in the Old Testament there are types, figures, and shadows of the divine and spiritual things revealed in the New Testament. Things that are divine and spiritual are mysterious, beyond the understanding of our natural mentality. However, we may understand these divine, spiritual, and mysterious things by the types, figures, and shadows in the Old Testament. Nevertheless, there is a problem here in that we may read about all the Old Testament types, figures, and allegories, but find it very difficult to see the significance of these things. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr8679R7ew6MJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> As a help to knowing the significance of the Old Testament types, we should realize that the record in the Old Testament does not merely concern the history of an ancient people. This record is also about us. Hence, when we read the Old Testament, we are reading about ourselves and not only about the children of Israel. We should not read the book of <span class="pg" data-page-id="1886" id="1886">[1886]</span> Exodus merely as history. We need to see ourselves in this book. Exodus contains not only the history of an ancient people; it also contains our story. It is the story of our present Christian life. Moreover, many spiritual and divine things related to our Christian experience are typified in this book. It is very important that we realize this. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyND8y00OaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB">RECOVERY OF THE BROKEN COVENANT</h2><p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0rz8Mx7qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> Second, as we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37972" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">chapter thirty-four</span> with this understanding, we also need to see that in this chapter we have a full recovery of the broken covenant. For this reason, many things recorded in this chapter are a repetition of what was given earlier. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37973" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Exodus 34</span> is a chapter of repetition, a chapter that repeats what God has already spoken. Nearly everything in this chapter is a repetition. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBf9oHDbKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> The covenant God had made with His people during Moses’ first stay with Him on the mountain had been broken. The two tablets of testimony, which signified that covenant, had been broken and cast aside. This covenant was not broken by God, the One who gave the law; it was broken by the one who received the tables of the law. We have seen that if it had not been for Moses as God’s companion, everything would have ended there with the breaking of the covenant. The special relationship between God and His people would have been seriously damaged. However, this companion of God knew God’s heart, and he knew that God would not give up His purpose with the children of Israel. Moses knew that this purposeful God had a very strong intention, and that no one could stop Him from doing what He intended to do. Perhaps God may be temporarily delayed or frustrated, but He cannot be stopped. </p>
<p data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf8v8LoqRmndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr"> Because it was necessary for God to keep His standing, His position, He needed a companion to be the mediator between Him and His people. This mediator could make propitiation in behalf of the people and appease God’s anger in that situation. As we have seen, Moses went to God as a mediator. Every point that Moses covered in his talk with God was a matter related to what was on God’s heart. This was the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1887" id="1887">[1887]</span> reason God sanctioned what Moses said and granted his petitions. </p>
<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeVPbWzqNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> After God had been appeased, it was necessary for the broken covenant to be recovered. The tablets signifying the covenant had been broken. Now in order to recover the situation between God and His people, it certainly was necessary for the broken covenant to be recovered. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37974" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Chapter thirty-four</span>, therefore, is a chapter concerned with the recovery of the broken covenant. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bRKh3NEKXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37975" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Exodus 34:1</span> says, “And Jehovah said to Moses, Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I will write upon the tablets the words which were on the first tablets, which you broke in pieces.” Because God had been appeased and because Moses had made propitiation in behalf of the people, the Lord had the ground to speak this way to Moses. The proposal in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37976" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">34:1</span> was not made by Moses; it was made by the Lord. The propitiation made by Moses for the people meant a great deal to God. Apart from that propitiation, God would not have had the ground to do anything to recover the broken covenant. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJp2fO--Uiqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37977" data-verses="Exodus 34:2">34:2</span> the Lord went on to say to Moses, “And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and stand by Me there on the top of the mountain.” It was necessary for Moses to come up to the mountaintop to meet with the Lord. The Lord could not go down to where Moses was. The mountaintop was the meeting place for both parties, for both God and Moses. The meeting on the mountaintop involved Moses going up and God coming down. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRE4IKgmi2TX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO">MEETING WITH THE LORD ALONE</h2><p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJyiRVRfNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37978" data-verses="Exodus 34:4-5">Verses 4 and 5</span> say, “And he hewed two tablets of stone like the first ones; and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai as Jehovah had commanded him, and he took in his hands two tablets of stone. And Jehovah descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.” In these verses we see that Moses went up to Mount Sinai, and the Lord descended to Mount Sinai. Hence, to Moses it was a matter of going up, but to God it was a matter of coming down. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1888" id="1888">[1888]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9eRplOfEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37979" data-verses="Exodus 34:2">verse 2</span> the Lord charged Moses to be ready in the morning and to come up in the morning to Mount Sinai. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37980" data-verses="Exodus 34:4">verse 4</span>, “Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him.” I appreciate this word about meeting with the Lord in the morning. How marvelous it would be if we could meet together every morning! </p>
<p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfTFnmRxvPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37981" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">chapter thirty-four</span> carefully, we shall see that God did not tell Moses explicitly to meet with Him in the morning of the next day. Rather, God simply said for him to come up “in the morning.” However, this must refer to the next morning available to Moses, that is, to the morning of the next day. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr8679R7e7o8JK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> To meet with the Lord in the morning means not only to meet with Him early in the day; it also means that we should meet with God in a situation that is full of light. Our meeting with God should be at sunrise, not at sunset. The entrance both of the tabernacle and of the temple was toward the east, toward the sunrise (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="37982" data-verses="Exodus 27:13-15">27:13-15</span>). The way we take should be in the light. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37983" data-verses="Proverbs 4:18">Proverbs 4:18</span> says, “The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” The way we take should be toward the sunrise, not toward the sunset. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnkYcNUPGh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37984" data-verses="Exodus 34:3">34:3</span> the Lord said to Moses, “And no man shall come up with you, neither let any man be seen on all the mountain; neither let the flocks and the herds feed before that mountain.” Here the Lord told Moses not to bring anyone with him on the mountain. Moses was not permitted to bring Joshua, Aaron, or anyone else. He was to come to the Lord alone. Furthermore, he was to leave all the flocks and herds. No doubt, he was also to leave behind all his possessions. This means that when Moses went up the mountain to meet with the Lord, he was not to bring with him anyone or anything except the tablets of stone. </p>

<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneDNPN7MHHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="37999" data-verses="Exodus 34:18-35">Verses 18 through 35</span> of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38000" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Exodus 34</span> cover three important matters: God’s charge to His people to feast and rest with Him, five conditions for enjoying the Lord, and God’s infusion into Moses. In this message we shall consider the charge related to feasting and resting with the Lord. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbouyVSBw1T4UeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN">FEASTING AND RESTING</h2><p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83AsBamgyXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38001" data-verses="Exodus 34:18">verse 18</span> the Lord says, “You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread: seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time of the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38002" data-verses="Exodus 34:21-22">verses 21 and 22</span> He goes on to speak of keeping the Sabbath and observing the feast of weeks and the feast of ingathering. In these verses God commanded the people to feast with Him and rest with Him. If I had been Moses, I might have said, “Lord, when You called me to come to the mountaintop, You told me to bring two tablets. You promised to rewrite the Ten Commandments on these tablets. But now You wouldn’t say a word about these commandments. Instead, You are telling me that we should feast with You and rest with You.” </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCkaBYvaafwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> It was not God’s intention that His people would try to keep the Ten Commandments. God’s intention was to command His people to enjoy Him—to feast with Him and rest in Him. This is contrary to our natural desire to want always to do something for God. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9BIoCMoyQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> Consider the parable of the prodigal son in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38003" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span>. When the prodigal son came back to his father, he said to the father, “Make me as one of your hired servants” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38004" data-verses="Luke 15:19">Luke 15:19</span>). This <span class="pg" data-page-id="1898" id="1898">[1898]</span> indicates that the returned prodigal wanted to do something for his father. The father, however, did not have the heart to listen to that kind of talk. Immediately he said to the servants, “Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38005" data-verses="Luke 15:23">v. 23</span>). The father’s desire was that they all would have a feast. In feasting together they would have enjoyment and rest. </p>
<p data-content-id="PMpE0WkF5HulOrGH-zWl70fqmOovIa2YpYMKlmhed48W2aSB-FiykJIxxN5toFyX3"> Moses did not know that it was not God’s intention to charge His people to keep His commandments. The keeping of the commandments must be secondary; it must be the issue of feasting with the Lord and resting with Him. If the children of Israel would feast with the Lord properly and rest with Him continually, they would not have a problem in keeping the Ten Commandments. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yN_0Ye189qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> This principle also applies to us today. If we feast with the Lord every day and rest with Him during the day, everything will be all right in our daily living. However, a brother may endeavor to be a good husband without feasting with the Lord and resting in Him. Likewise, a sister may try to be a good wife without this feasting and resting. But if we do not feast with the Lord and rest in Him, we shall be a poor husband or wife. Instead of trying to fulfill <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38006" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span>, we should simply feast with the Lord a number of times during the day. In the morning we should enjoy the feast of unleavened bread; during the day, the feast of Pentecost; and in the evening, the feast of tabernacles. The children of Israel enjoyed these feasts yearly, but we should enjoy them daily. Furthermore, we should rest with the Lord many times throughout the day. The children of Israel had a Sabbath once a week, but we should have a Sabbath rest many times during the day. Actually, every hour, we should rest with the Lord. If we feast with the Lord and rest in Him in this way, we shall surely experience <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38007" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9MLCfIi6RI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9">THREE FEASTS</h2><p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-fldSwz8-FcJlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> According to the Old Testament, God had ordained that seven feasts be observed annually by the children of Israel: the Passover, the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of firstfruit, the feast of weeks (Pentecost), the feast of trumpets, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1899" id="1899">[1899]</span> feast of atonement, and the feast of tabernacles (also called the feast of ingathering or harvest). The feast of unleavened bread was held immediately after the feast of Passover in the month of Abib, at the beginning of the year. Abib, the first month of the year, indicates a new beginning. The word Abib means a tender sprout. In a very real sense, the feast of the Passover and the feast of unleavened bread were one feast. We may say that the first day was the feast of Passover and the following days were the feast of unleavened bread. This indicates that immediately after we enjoy the Passover, we need to cleanse ourselves of all leaven in order to keep the feast of unleavened bread. For us today to keep the feast of unleavened bread means that we live a clean life, a life without sin, without leaven. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6eMgcLxIs4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> The feast of firstfruit issues in the feast of Pentecost. Between the feasts of unleavened bread and of ingathering, there is some enjoyment of the produce of the good land during the feast of firstfruit. Toward the end of the year, at the feast of ingathering, God’s people had the full enjoyment of the produce of the good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="2WrTsDVqiqH8_Zcv5cBxuMFTYxWedSI9O4vbLr2hrGs8sVORPH6xtE4ngBTBdPMpa"> The feasts in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38008" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Exodus 34</span> are all for enjoyment. At the beginning we may say that we have sowing and farming, and then we start to enjoy the produce. But at the end we have the full harvest for our full enjoyment. The feasts that were observed in the intervals were not as crucial as far as the enjoyment of the good land was concerned. The important point here is that the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38009" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Exodus 34</span> indicates that God wanted His people to have the full enjoyment of the good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="uIUNYvwaBvK9SZG7KuUXl7-AE4AmFRxFLEjjA-mQTR6wNYvdWRTuMVzZLwn16DwPZ"> In addition to the feasts, the children of Israel were to keep the Sabbath every week. No matter how busy they were, they had to take one day a week to stop work and rest with the Lord. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-44KzFcZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ">DAILY FEASTING AND RESTING</h2><p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMBNaIRh-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> In these verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38010" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Exodus 34</span> we have feasting and resting. These are two matters for us to enjoy today. Every day we need to feast and rest. It is not possible for us to feast all day long. However, we can enjoy a feast three times a day, at morning, at <span class="pg" data-page-id="1900" id="1900">[1900]</span> noon, and in the evening. Moreover, we need to rest with the Lord many times during the day. At least three times a day we should feast with the Lord, and many times a day we should rest with Him. Again and again we should take a break to remember the Lord and rest with Him. Suppose we took a break every twenty minutes to enjoy a rest with the Lord. If we deduct eight hours spent in sleeping, this would allow us to rest with the Lord at least forty-eight times during the day. How good it would be to have a Sabbath every twenty minutes! </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbENN9gL7nhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> The significance of the Sabbath is that it is a time to remember the Lord, a time to remember our Creator. If we do not take the time for a Sabbath rest, this means that we forget the Lord. But whenever we have a Sabbath, we remember Him. Certainly it is not too much for us to remember the Lord every fifteen or twenty minutes. Let us practice to remember the Lord and rest in Him time after time during the day. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0WXwMJtjMWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6">THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD</h2><p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcKCTIKA6zJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> As we have pointed out, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38011" data-verses="Exodus 34:18">34:18</span> does not mention the feast of Passover, but the feast of unleavened bread. The reason is that the concern here is not salvation; it is our fellowship with God. We have already been saved, but what is the situation with respect to our fellowship with the Lord? If we desire to maintain fellowship with God, we need to clear away all the leaven from our lives. This is to keep the feast of unleavened bread. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h4AkgDOsl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD">THE FEAST OF WEEKS</h2><p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFntD7xMlB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> The second feast spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38012" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">chapter thirty-four</span> is the feast of weeks, which came in between the feast of unleavened bread and the feast of ingathering. The feast of weeks or Pentecost is the full issue of resurrection life. We know that the feast of weeks is observed seven weeks after the feast of firstfruit. This is my reason for saying that the feast of Pentecost is the full issue of the feast of firstfruit. Firstfruit produces Pentecost. This is true both in the type in the Old Testament and in the fulfillment of the type in the New Testament. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1901" id="1901">[1901]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4bkY408GiuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> In the foregoing message we saw that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38023" data-verses="Exodus 34:18-35">34:18-35</span> there are three important matters: feasting and resting with the Lord, five conditions for enjoying the Lord as our feast, and God’s infusion into Moses by His speaking with him. In the previous message we considered the matter of feasting with the Lord and resting with Him. In this message we shall go on to consider the five conditions that must be fulfilled in order for us to feast with the Lord. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL22Jf8T_8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8">TO REDEEM THE FIRSTLING OF A DONKEY<br/>WITH A LAMB</h2><p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cypijkvOlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> The first of the five conditions is described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38024" data-verses="Exodus 34:20">verse 20</span>: “And the firstling of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, and if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. Every firstborn of your sons you shall redeem, and none shall appear before Me empty.” This signifies that our natural man must be replaced with Christ so that we may live a sanctified life for God. Even though we have been redeemed, we still are natural. We are a “donkey,” an unclean animal; we are not a lamb. Yes, we have been redeemed, but we are not clean. Therefore, as “donkeys” we need our natural being to be replaced with Christ as the Lamb. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzr3iJ1lUyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> As far as sanctification is concerned, we are not sheep or oxen; we are donkeys. Even though we have been redeemed, our natural man is still unclean in the sight of God. Hence, in order to be sanctified to the Lord, we need Christ to be our Substitute. The Passover lamb typifies Christ as our Redeemer. Through Him as our Substitute, we have been <span class="pg" data-page-id="1906" id="1906">[1906]</span> redeemed. However, because we are still unclean and natural, we cannot be a living sacrifice for God’s satisfaction. We need Christ to be our Substitute in sanctification. For more regarding the firstling of a donkey being redeemed with a lamb, see Life-study of Exodus, Message 27, pages 305-307. </p>
<p data-content-id="YQxCjJBuS6c19nmWngTJ9gRVRdNP-GwdbyoELpoG3C_CYNe5MEMwdjTEp4oMWo_rO"> No matter how nice we may be, or how good, we still are natural. On the one hand, I like to meet nice people. On the other hand, I realize that the nicer a person is, the more natural he is. I am not implying, of course, that in order to be spiritual we should be crude instead of nice. The point here is that even our natural niceness needs to be replaced with Christ. We need to remember that in our natural life we are a “donkey.” We have been redeemed, but we are still donkeys. So many “donkeys” have been gathered together in the church life. Now there is the need for all of us to be replaced with Christ. If our natural “donkey life” is not replaced with Christ, we shall be hindered in the enjoyment of the feasts and also in the keeping of the Sabbath. Having our natural life replaced with Christ is a condition both of feasting with the Lord and resting with Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="E23sjAFWTeX35JOJuPq9RTplOdEfCQuR65kbHqis8hZT0IrFgvI6FEqxNLTBgjCer">NOT OFFERING THE BLOOD<br/>OF THE LORD’S SACRIFICE<br/>WITH LEAVENED BREAD</h2><p data-content-id="DdarnURtStjPH1Rz1_FfcHnmSxPPh0bpFxHVX84VT-SKAcj95D_rnDrm1rSYlBhIE"> The second condition is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38025" data-verses="Exodus 34:25">34:25a</span>: “You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread.” This indicates that we should not mix Christ’s redemption with our sinful life. We should never mix Christ’s redemption with a sinful life. We should not declare that we are redeemed and then continue living in sin. To do this is to offer the blood of the Lord’s sacrifice with leavened bread. A person who is still living in sin should not boast that he has been redeemed. </p>
<p data-content-id="SXPMkEAWjre5tI9Dr867yT7e4ocJK21Bpll1x_x-SMozSA5-bICGfHPszxCYRMH7s"> We have pointed out that we need to keep the feast of unleavened bread. This is to purge away everything sinful as evidence that we have been redeemed by the blood of Christ. When a believer clears up his sinful life, this is a testimony that he has been redeemed by Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkxq8N658aXfwXDNzAQnracNXOmh1q9ogz0Q8oIPPxMBa7o01H-04Npt84DF0I8J2"> It is not hard for us to realize that if we still live in sin, yet claim that we have been redeemed, we shall not be able to <span class="pg" data-page-id="1907" id="1907">[1907]</span> enjoy Christ. We all have been redeemed by the blood of Christ in order to enjoy Christ. Nevertheless, we still must fulfill the condition of clearing away all leaven, the requirement of not mixing Christ’s redemption with a sinful life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="eGxvQc0p2yejchkCAaPHyrTasYW2pNeDOs5YOaxlrUdw_MxdLuVely-ckdC-yIyfg">NOT ALLOWING THE SACRIFICE OF THE FEAST<br/>OF THE PASSOVER TO REMAIN UNTIL THE MORNING</h2><p data-content-id="5gIMwHsvXdtX4snNzzIJCMjQ8CdBVrW3GCR8LWp7JzPnMZ48ohsxIi7lBGx5ZZCHU"> A third condition of feasting with the Lord and resting with Him is found in the second part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38026" data-verses="Exodus 34:25">verse 25</span>: “Neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover remain until the morning.” What is the significance of not allowing the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover to remain until the morning? This signifies that we should enjoy the riches of Christ in this age and not leave them until the next age. We need to enjoy Christ today. We need to enjoy Him in full in this age. We cannot exhaust the enjoyment of Christ. We can enjoy to the utmost our particular portion of Him. Whatever portion we receive of Christ should be enjoyed today. We should not leave anything for the next “morning”; that is, we should not postpone the enjoyment of Christ until the coming age. Enjoy Christ now. Do not wait for the future to enjoy Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZPyc1-noLYWcukx3jAuR_h6EdD0LqbYtMUBEomreUiiYvb7iOLBA0ea4qiJL-ZpK"> Some saints may have the thought of waiting for a period of time before they enjoy Christ. Certain young people may say to themselves, “I am still young. Let me enjoy the worldly things for a time. Later I’ll come back to the enjoyment of Christ.” Do not make this mistake. If you put off the enjoyment of Christ until the future, you will not fulfill the third condition of feasting with the Lord—the requirement that we not hold the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover until the morning. Do not wait to enjoy the riches of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw3-YB1LLPBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw">BRINGING THE FIRST OF THE FIRSTFRUITS<br/>TO THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZwBzB29JYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38027" data-verses="Exodus 34:26">Exodus 34:26a</span> says, “You shall bring the first of the firstfruits of your ground to the house of Jehovah your God.” Here we see another condition: bringing the first of the firstfruits to the house of God. This signifies bringing the topmost experience of Christ to the church meetings for God’s satisfaction. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1908" id="1908">[1908]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneDCNd7IVnXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM"> Many saints are very poor in the experience of Christ. As a result, they do not have any fruit. Some may have fruit, but most of this fruit is not firstfruit. We all need to have some of the topmost experiences of Christ. We should not share these experiences of Christ with anyone until we bring them to the church meetings for God’s satisfaction. Those who have adequate experience know what it means to bring the topmost experience of Christ to the church meetings for God’s satisfaction. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbouyaQRwwBIUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN">NOT BOILING THE KID IN ITS MOTHER’S MILK</h2><p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83PuRasyyXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> Now we come to the last condition, a condition that may seem very strange: “You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38028" data-verses="Exodus 34:26">v. 26b</span>). You may be surprised at the significance of the requirement not to boil a kid in its mother’s milk. This requirement indicates or typifies that we should not seethe young believers with the milk of the word; that is, we should not “boil” them with the word of life that is for nourishment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38029" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">1 Pet. 2:2</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCkVDIvRIPwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> In ancient times some people probably did have the practice of boiling a kid in its mother’s milk. This may have been regarded as a delicious dish. As we have indicated, we should not use the milk of the word to seethe young believers. This is to use the milk of the word, which is for life-nourishment, to kill the young ones. The point here is that the milk of the Word of God is for nourishment. However, today many Christians use the Word to kill young believers. Be careful never to use the Word to kill the young ones. The Word is for the nourishment of the believers. It is possible to use the Word either to nourish the saints or to seethe them, to kill them. In the past many of us have used the Word of God to seethe the saints. </p>

<p data-content-id="-ZWEX_hT-hrJwwya4t-yC90YZn89qeF4g5hdW5RrFZCb6GEa33bx6d1B0cY3pbfbS"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38035" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Chapter thirty-four</span> of Exodus, the record of Moses’ stay with God, covers three main subjects: feasting with the Lord and resting with Him, five conditions for enjoying the Lord, and God’s infusion of Himself into Moses. In the two foregoing messages we covered the three feasts and the Sabbath and the five conditions. In this message, after a word of introduction and review, we shall consider God’s infusion of Himself into Moses. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="p2icA3Sl-lJUyA0YBiB9DJCfOwqRI6Z8AfYgxylUHKLBjExaSXRxt0fbwW8crggX9">THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING EXODUS 34</h2><p data-content-id="vUFH6A_sPE1fsaXb-flddyz83W8JlBFwPTKipZOLhS4BJfzXNFigop7aDF-xXO-jQ"> We have seen that Moses broke into pieces the two tablets containing the Ten Commandments. This indicates that the covenant made by God with the children of Israel was broken. A covenant was made in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38036" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">chapters twenty through twenty-four</span>, and this covenant was sealed by the sprinkling of the blood of the redeeming sacrifice. We may say that the sealing of the covenant was actually the signing of the covenant by God. God signed the covenant by sprinkling it with the redeeming blood of the sacrifice. The terms of this covenant were the Ten Commandments with all the ordinances. God wanted to have His people completely and thoroughly covenanted to Him. But because of the incident of the golden calf, the covenant was broken. However, in His mercy God came in to recover this broken covenant. This was the reason God told Moses to hew out two tablets of stone and to come up to the mountaintop to meet with Him. God’s intention was to recover the covenant. </p>
<p data-content-id="WNmCnMItuvVbQGWxlol6ROgcDi4s4d-18YGvq9CJMR4VBvgn31izS5ZmySq1bImNI"> Moses no doubt expected God to repeat the giving of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="1914" id="1914">[1914]</span> Ten Commandments and the ordinances. He may have been happy as he prepared the two tablets of stone for this purpose and brought them with him to the mountaintop. But after Moses arrived there and God descended to him, God did something else instead of giving Moses the Ten Commandments. What God spoke to Moses before giving him the Ten Commandments the second time was according to the real desire of His heart. It was not God’s intention merely to have a people to keep His commandments and ordinances. God’s intention was to dispense Himself into His chosen people so that they would be fully infused with Him in order to express Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdEB4il_qyYeCdASbd8-36KzFeZY6er_LZqurteGJsUsOO3Y6F8Ksc0MJ30pH4RhZ"> From the very beginning, the law did not have a standing as part of God’s original intention. In typology, the position of the law is that of a concubine, typified by Hagar. This indicates that in the sight of God and in His economy the law does not have a place of honor just as a concubine does not have a legal position. The Bible says that the law was something added. It was not a part of God’s original intention and therefore does not have a place of honor. In a sense, God was forced to decree the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="IrjnlWqJ43KG0PXO0XuMOPaIRj-3Luva5lhkj1Y0pGKx0qXVkcm3xLSROjd4zI-YC"> God was not unhappy because the two tablets were broken. God was angry not because of the breaking of the tablets, but because of the idolatry of the golden calf. When He met with Moses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38037" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">chapter thirty-four</span>, He did not at first say anything about the Ten Commandments. </p>
<p data-content-id="HatwRoocAXfpk5U_JSbECP9gI7HhdAVIllnwJNpt58oj8Ig0iGxtjJHK6VaJT8C42"> First God told Moses that He would do marvels in order to bring the people into the good land: “And He said, Behold, I am making a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels which have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in all the nations; and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of Jehovah, for it is a fearful thing which I am doing with you. Observe what I am commanding you this day; behold, I will drive out from before you the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38038" data-verses="Exodus 34:10-11">vv. 10-11</span>). God would do miracles for the purpose of bringing the people into the good land where they could enjoy Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="XxRGADQuesKPZwuC1N0WYyMJujsWf6nYOWUI47jmQ5fRZqvQK0AhISj4XFM6WXdv6"> Second, God warned the people regarding idolatry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38039" data-verses="Exodus 34:12-17">vv. 12-17</span>). The Lord said, “You shall not bow yourself down to <span class="pg" data-page-id="1915" id="1915">[1915]</span> another god, for Jehovah—Jealous is His name—is a jealous God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38040" data-verses="Exodus 34:14">v. 14</span>). He also said, “You shall not make for yourself molten gods” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38041" data-verses="Exodus 34:17">v. 17</span>). God definitely warned the people to stay away from every kind of idolatry. We must not allow anything to be a substitute for God or a replacement for Him. We must take Him and Him alone as God. </p>
<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcFATIJBazJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> Then the Lord went on to speak to Moses concerning feasting with Him and resting with Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38042" data-verses="Exodus 34:18">verse 18</span> He said, “You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread: seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time of the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38043" data-verses="Exodus 34:22">verse 22</span> He continued, “You shall observe the feast of weeks, the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the feast of the ingathering at the turn of the year.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38044" data-verses="Exodus 34:21">verse 21</span> the Lord spoke to Moses about keeping the Sabbath: “Six days you shall work, and on the seventh day you shall rest; in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.” We can see, therefore, that the Lord spoke to Moses about idolatry and about feasting and resting. But at this time He did not say a word concerning the Ten Commandments and the ordinances. Instead, He told Moses that the males were to feast with Him three times a year and that every seven days they were to remember Him by resting with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h3CkgAPMl6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD"> In a previous message we pointed out that the three feasts mentioned in this chapter indicate that we need to feast with the Lord three times a day. Furthermore, we have seen that the weekly Sabbath indicates that during the day, perhaps every fifteen or twenty minutes, we should take a break to remember the Lord by resting with Him. A year is a turn of time, and a day is also such a turn. Daily we should feast with the Lord and rest with Him. Both the feasting and the resting are for the enjoyment of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFovD7yMFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38045" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Exodus 34</span> the Lord not only spoke to Moses about feasting and resting; He also charged him with five matters that are conditions to be fulfilled in order for God’s people to enjoy Him. According to our natural understanding, each of these five points is insignificant. The first of these conditions is the matter of redeeming the firstling of a donkey with a lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38046" data-verses="Exodus 34:20">v. 20</span>), and the last is the word about not boiling a kid in <span class="pg" data-page-id="1916" id="1916">[1916]</span> its mother’s milk (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38047" data-verses="Exodus 34:26">v. 26</span>). Why did the Lord not speak to Moses about the honoring of parents or about the commandment concerning murder? Why did He speak to him about such things as redeeming the firstling of a donkey with a lamb and about not boiling a kid in its mother’s milk? The reason is that if we do not fulfill these five conditions, our enjoyment of the Lord will be broken. If we would maintain our enjoyment of the Lord by feasting and resting with Him, we must take care of these five seemingly insignificant requirements. </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_Fssjj9rck5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> If we study <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38048" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Exodus 34</span> only with our mentality, we shall not be able to understand this chapter. But if we consider this chapter in the light of our spiritual experience, we shall see that the key here is the enjoyment of the Lord. This chapter reveals that we need to enjoy the Lord all day long by feasting with Him and resting with Him. Furthermore, along with this enjoyment and as a requirement for maintaining it, we need to fulfill five conditions. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_CsYl6fvZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> It seems that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38049" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Exodus 34</span> Moses was concerned for the decree of the law, not for the enjoyment of the Lord or for the infusion of the Lord into him. If we are enlightened as we read this chapter, we shall realize that we should not focus our attention on the Ten Commandments and the ordinances, because God is more concerned that we take care of the feasts and the Sabbaths. We need to take care of the repeated feasting and resting with the Lord. We need to feast on Him and rest with Him for our full enjoyment of Him. Then we shall be infused with Him. As a result, we shall be filled inwardly, and we shall shine outwardly. </p>

<p data-content-id="krqSdqyVkhlGxbfvQvLcFAjIOS6zJ9WSM3rserM9yxUjKSTqCFuLBQRmPZEgRxNej"> In this message we shall begin to consider a section containing five chapters, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38072" data-verses="Exodus 35:1">chapters thirty-five through thirty-nine</span>. In these chapters we have a record of the making of the tabernacle with its furniture and the holy garments for the priests. Since we have covered most of the details related to these matters in previous messages, we do not need to consider all these details again. Rather, in this message and in the message following we shall consider certain basic matters found in these chapters. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="JEan5QW_9INhJNcuSe-h3CUgGc8l6lSNr-BuTVUnPZG9Kz8TKVGzbsL7I6wYoVaQD">A WORD CONCERNING THE SABBATH</h2><p data-content-id="z32K6bIEKf9dn4GOwRlFovz77fFB5i8OIp--mVPIf-wxwZxm6WGTQfPaOqHuStU3s"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38073" data-verses="Exodus 35:1-3">Exodus 35:1-3</span> says, “And Moses gathered all the congregation of the sons of Israel together and said to them, These are the words which Jehovah has commanded to do. Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy sabbath of rest to Jehovah; whoever does work on it shall be put to death. You shall not kindle a fire in all your dwellings on the sabbath day.” At the beginning of this section we have a word concerning the Sabbath. It seems that this has nothing to do with the making of the tabernacle with its furniture and the garments for the priests. Why does this section begin with a serious word about the Sabbath? According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38074" data-verses="Exodus 35:2">35:2</span>, working on the Sabbath was a crime punishable by death. The failure to rest with the Lord on the Sabbath was a capital offense. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38075" data-verses="Exodus 35:3">verse 3</span>, not even cooking was allowed on the Sabbath. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1924" id="1924">[1924]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="aIz7hchtr8fuBtiPzA_FssTj14Mk5H8esgW5ecqSvu_qoGGryRUlkuAIoT11HK-8X"> Apparently these three verses, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38076" data-verses="Exodus 35:1-3">35:1-3</span>, have nothing to do with the making of the tabernacle with its furniture and the priestly garments. Actually there is an important connection here, but we need adequate spiritual experience in order to understand this point in the Word. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tSanpS-B9o40zeMuYw3-YBVLLNBsQ0_LM6OWO9mIlLpUJ-t0Chvcu3hWB7pr1Upgw">A REVIEW OF CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</h2><p data-content-id="hiOWiC7-0Y27-Ik6iOZwBzh29LYJJDG-9pmSc1f0cE-mHFqQGTyqussvoqVRhDtfJ"> As a help to understanding why a command about keeping the Sabbath is mentioned at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38077" data-verses="Exodus 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span>, let us review some points from the messages on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38078" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">chapter thirty-four</span>. There we covered three main matters: the feasting and resting with the Lord, the five conditions for enjoying the Lord, and God’s infusion of Himself into Moses. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="UeM85URd3f3ndHy4DneDCN97LVHXHUW89KMQLsPsTzuuuaTmLInoAWyOug-38VNnM">Five Conditions for Enjoying the Lord</h2><p data-content-id="Mkz7wT9F-m630QUdbouyaQxwzBoUeDPzzz8L3F1FuvmbJR3qZmCuGb2AU-8Z0M3nN"> We have seen that the first of the five conditions was the redeeming of a donkey with a lamb and that the last was the requirement not to boil a kid in its mother’s milk. When I read this portion as a young Christian, I was not able to understand why such matters were included in the Bible. God had called Moses to the mountain for the purpose of recovering the broken covenant. If God wanted to review with Moses the details of the law, why did He not speak about honoring parents or the commandment related to murder? Why did He instead speak about redeeming a donkey and about not boiling a kid in its mother’s milk? It seemed to me that such matters were not important. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmuBTDNNM29IUzA87o83PuxavzSXoheFntXzuL0voTXnlaHoFSG1VsfIQzYLBe7fS"> By means of human reasoning we cannot understand why these five conditions were given or what they mean. But these conditions were very important requirements related to the enjoyment of the feasts by God’s people. If the children of Israel did not fulfill these conditions, they would lose the enjoyment of the feasts. These conditions are also meaningful for us today in their spiritual interpretation according to our experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="idCyBNmrkB4H2w0N5UCkVDovSJvwZP692Up1NOpTVHSbPtjw8DpIyAZntQds75Ema"> To redeem a donkey with a lamb indicates that we as fallen ones who are unclean, are redeemed by Christ. Do you intend to enjoy feasting and resting with the Lord? If you do, <span class="pg" data-page-id="1925" id="1925">[1925]</span> you need to remember that according to your old man, your natural man, your flesh, and according to the fact that you are a descendant of Adam, you are a “donkey.” No matter who you may be, in the sight of God your natural man is a donkey. If you intend to enjoy Christ as your feast and your rest, you need to realize this. We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38079" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span> the Lord Jesus indicated to Nicodemus that he was a serpent. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38080" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Exodus 34</span> we see that, according to the natural life, all those who would enjoy Christ are donkeys needing to be redeemed. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38081" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">Leviticus 11</span> says that a donkey is an unclean animal. Furthermore, a donkey is a beast of burden. In our natural man and according to our natural life, we can be compared to beasts under a heavy burden. We are unclean, and we are heavily burdened. The best way for a donkey to be free from its burden is to die. In a similar manner the way for us, unclean beasts of burden, to enjoy Christ and rest with Him is for us to be replaced by Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="1eAgQUgBRe2qW5UC7pjM7Aaixws7Gl8qDCb3LgYRIn80UHi-FUKCjwfCSt0fv9x4E"> The second condition mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38082" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Exodus 34</span> is not to mix leaven with the redeeming blood. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38083" data-verses="Exodus 34:25">Verse 25</span> says, “You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread.” Immediately after having our natural person replaced with Christ, we must clear away all leaven. Do you want to enjoy the blood of Christ? If this is your desire, do not mix the redeeming blood with the leaven of your sinful life. </p>
<p data-content-id="9IWXxSK0VSeru1JSP1wJ7sW3K_vl3thk3e38kGNwIYxbNzcKQhpNMeFGhCnWAto2e"> First our natural man needs to be replaced by Christ. In Paul’s words, “I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38084" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal 2:20</span>). This means that the “donkey” has been crucified and the Christ who replaces us now lives in us. Now we must go on to clear away all the leaven. We need the redeeming blood, but we cannot offer this blood along with our sinful life. Such a thing is strictly prohibited. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8SpK-JgqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38085" data-verses="Exodus 34:25">Exodus 34:25b</span> says, “Neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover remain until the morning.” Here we have the third condition for enjoying Christ. After we have been replaced by Christ and have cleared away all leaven, we need to exhaust today’s portion of Christ. This means that we must enjoy Christ to the uttermost today, not leaving anything of today’s portion for the future. However, many Christians do <span class="pg" data-page-id="1926" id="1926">[1926]</span> not have an appetite to enjoy Christ fully today. They can be compared to naughty children who do not eat all their food at dinnertime. These believers have a portion of Christ, but they do not enjoy it. The requirement that the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover not remain until the morning means that we need to exhaust the portion of Christ we have for our enjoyment today. We should not postpone the enjoyment of Christ until tomorrow or until the next age. Instead, we must fully enjoy the portion of Christ that has been given to us today. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5M5XHIF4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> The fourth requirement for feasting with Christ and enjoying Him is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38086" data-verses="Exodus 34:26">34:26a</span>: “You shall bring the first of the firstfruits of your ground to the house of Jehovah your God.” As we are enjoying today’s portion of Christ, we need to bring the firstfruit, the top portion, to the meeting to offer to God for His satisfaction. We need to bring the topmost experience of Christ to the house of God, to the church meetings, and there offer this portion to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fdxl2_StcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38087" data-verses="Exodus 34:26">Exodus 34:26b</span> gives us the fifth condition: “You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.” A mother is for producing life, and milk is for the nourishment of life. We should not produce young ones and then turn around and kill them. After producing them, we need to nourish them. This means that when we are enjoying Christ, we should not cause anything of death to enter into the realm, the sphere, of the nourishing life. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vRnTNriFad_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52"> Recently in a meeting some of the saints were declaring, “Eating Jesus is the way!” While they were declaring this, I was saying to myself, “You say that eating Jesus is the way. But have you eaten Him?” Yes, eating Jesus is the way. But we need to consider how much of the Lord we ourselves have eaten. For some of us, the proclamation that eating Jesus is the way may simply be a slogan. If we would enjoy Christ, we need to fulfill the five conditions. We need to be replaced by Christ, we need to clear away all leaven, we need to exhaust our present portion of Christ, we need to bring the topmost experience of Christ to the church meeting and offer it to God, and we need to keep death away from the sphere of nourishing life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1927" id="1927">[1927]</span> </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XvJeYQKO1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-">THE OFFERING OF THE MATERIALS</h2><p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9MuoJlACnJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38111" data-verses="Exodus 35:4-9">35:4-9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38112" data-verses="Exodus 35:20-29">20-29</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38113" data-verses="Exodus 36:3-7">36:3-7</span> we have the offering of the materials. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38114" data-verses="Exodus 35:4-5">Exodus 35:4 and 5</span> say, “And Moses said to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, This is the word which Jehovah has commanded, saying, Take from among you a heave offering to Jehovah; everyone whose heart is willing shall bring it, Jehovah’s heave offering.” Then various materials are mentioned: gold, silver, bronze, blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats’ hair, rams’ skins dyed red, porpoise skins, acacia wood, oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the incense of fragrant spices, and onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCl8JB4LvVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> In the matter of offering these materials, the people who had been idolatrous now became faithful to God. Formerly they used their gold to make an idol. But now they were faithful and offered everything to God for the building of the tabernacle, His dwelling place. This thought is conveyed in the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38115" data-verses="Exodus 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span> regarding the offering of the materials. However, it is somewhat superficial. The emphasis in this message will be on the spiritual significance of the offering of the materials. </p>
<p data-content-id="bpSnLwi4_Ct7y7X1P5_CsYF6ftZKauB11qEBSPc4edSKO5CkZ_rjt670WHxMZTQ9M"> The materials offered for the building of the tabernacle <span class="pg" data-page-id="1934" id="1934">[1934]</span> typify the Christ experienced by us in different aspects. Although these materials were gained by the children of Israel while they were in Egypt, they are nevertheless called heave offerings, wave offerings, and freewill offerings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38116" data-verses="Exodus 35:5">35:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38117" data-verses="Exodus 35:21-22">21-22</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38118" data-verses="Exodus 35:24">24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38119" data-verses="Exodus 35:29">29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38120" data-verses="Exodus 36:3">36:3</span>). Some translations do not point out that these offerings were heave offerings, wave offerings, and freewill offerings. Instead, certain versions say only that these offerings were gifts or contributions. The heave offering signifies the ascended Christ; the wave offering, the resurrected Christ; and the freewill offering, the Christ we offer to God of our free will. God does not force us to experience Christ. Whether or not we experience Christ and then offer Him to God is a matter of our free will. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe6XS1psTTi4O7B3bsQe8QtszwAajT4BhyRLxJWqUPIYajJouoGU_SQ6MMtP9YWjg"> According to the spiritual interpretation, all the offerings here are types of the Christ whom we experience. Sometimes we experience Christ as the reality of God. This is gold. At other times we experience Christ as our Redeemer or as our redemption. This is silver. At other times we may experience Christ as the One judged by God for us, as the Christ who takes our place in judgment, as the One who is our Substitute to suffer God’s judgment for us. This is bronze. All these are different aspects of the Christ experienced by us. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYd7gm3RV_KZZ2P8755T5-jLj89jlidwOISWwRWZ1mSj5sXn12GN8FMhoY8kVWiQv"> For the building of the church, God’s dwelling place, we all need to experience Christ. If we do not experience Christ, we shall not have anything to offer to God as a heave offering, wave offering, or freewill offering for the building up of His dwelling place. Suppose some of the Israelites were empty-handed, having nothing to offer to the Lord for the building of the tabernacle. They may have said, “Moses has spoken to us concerning offerings for the building of the tabernacle. But we are pitiful and have nothing to offer.” What a shame that would have been! Nevertheless, this is the situation of many saints today. As far as the experience of Christ is concerned, they do not have an offering to bring. Regarding the building up of the church, their hands are empty. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_o66VclLw7SrkppeoACnDTw6BePzB43QJGXSaxJL3C4WNtYpbUzv4F_NN0CdZgCB"> We all need to have some riches of the experience of Christ. At least we need to have a brooch or an earring (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38121" data-verses="Exodus 35:22">35:22</span>). We should at least have Christ as a small brooch that we can offer for the building of the church. Perhaps you are <span class="pg" data-page-id="1935" id="1935">[1935]</span> wondering what this means in our practical experience. Suppose a sister wears a little brooch. If in wearing that brooch she experiences Christ, eventually that experience, in its spiritual significance, will be an experience of Christ as a golden brooch. Likewise, a brother may experience Christ even in the small matter of wearing a tiepin. If a brother experiences Christ in the buying and wearing of a tiepin, that will become an aspect of Christ experienced by him. Then in the sight of God he will have Christ as a spiritual tiepin. The important point here is that we should not have anything by ourselves, but we should have everything by Christ and with Christ. If we experience Christ in a certain thing, we shall have Christ in a particular aspect to offer to God for the building up of the church, His dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="0aI2fHRlVYLsjXhYVsyNuvPKGKvAxY-ftpF3b7Ifxzw_vjYFntzGDjv8FaKd5O8nY"> It is possible to experience Christ even in buying a tie and in wearing that tie. If I experience Christ in the wearing of a tie, then in spiritual experience I shall have Christ as my golden tie. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ISbKfvULRZqmnYJwxqDzhx-hhkXcSWmIlIcy2ykzw3wgbdOQlu6CkrqAkpzWJPBR"> A married brother can experience Christ when he is tempted to argue with his wife. When he is about to argue with her, he should say, “Lord, I’m going to argue with my wife. Lord, I don’t want to argue without You. If You are not my way to argue with my wife, I will not argue with her.” If a brother experiences Christ in this way, he will gain Christ, even in a situation where he is about to argue with his wife. This is an illustration of how practical the experience of Christ needs to be. However, among many Christians today there is a shortage of the subjective teaching concerning the practical experience of Christ in our daily life. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PY4Y3FdHCRzXyrJDToyPz84YBr6FTFHaC4bcxzL4H_jz7wzB9bz1Rxm6iYny7ceb"> We need to experience Christ in every aspect of our daily life, for example, in the clothes we wear, in the way we cut our hair, and in our attitudes. In everything, great or small, we need to experience Christ. In wearing shoes, in cutting our hair, and even in expressing our attitudes, we should have Christ. A sister should not show a “long face” to her husband by herself. Instead, she should say, “Lord, I intend to show a long face to my husband. Will You do this with me? If You are not one with me in this matter, I will not do it.” Before showing her husband a long face, a married sister should first <span class="pg" data-page-id="1936" id="1936">[1936]</span> abide in the Lord and pray to Him concerning it. If she prays like this, she will not show a long face to her husband. On the contrary, she may show him a broad, happy face. I use this as an illustration to point out that we need to apply the truth of experiencing Christ as the materials offered to God for the building of His dwelling place in a practical way. If we are practical with this truth, we shall have something of Christ to offer to God for the building up of the church, His dwelling place on earth today. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BtgRm975zCc41anXsc7XvJeYWZe1jpSWdkggpIk2qTDFkAR8H4q7UmLrHAOXCV4j-">THE PREPARING OF THE WORKERS</h2><p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9MuoJlJSHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> We have pointed out that many Christians do not have anything of Christ to offer. But even if we do have Christ in many aspects as the materials, that is not yet the building. In order to have the building, we need not only the materials but also the skillful workers. Therefore, the next matter to be covered in these chapters is the preparing of the workers, the preparing of the gifted ones to function (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38122" data-verses="Exodus 35:10">35:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38123" data-verses="Exodus 35:30-35">30-35</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38124" data-verses="Exodus 36:1-2">36:1-2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38125" data-verses="Exodus 38:22-23">38:22-23</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCl8JBwbfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38126" data-verses="Exodus 35:1">Exodus 35</span>, the two leading workmen were Bezalel and Oholiab (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38127" data-verses="Exodus 35:30">vv. 30</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38128" data-verses="Exodus 35:34">34</span>). Bezalel was of the tribe of Judah, a kingly tribe, and Oholiab was of the tribe of Dan, a lowly tribe. This indicates that God does not care about our human estate, whether we are high or low. For the work of building His dwelling place, He can raise up one from a kingly tribe and also one from a lowly tribe. </p>

I prefer to use the word “lifted” in this verse. We need to have a heart that always lifts us up. We need an upward heart, not a downward heart. Many times I have been told that a certain brother or sister is discouraged, disappointed, or disheartened. Whenever we are disheartened, we are through with the work of God’s building. We constantly need an uplifted heart, even an uplifting heart, a heart that lifts us <span class="pg" data-page-id="1937" id="1937">[1937]</span> up. Every one of us needs such an uplifted heart. If we do not have this kind of heart, who then would be able to help us? </p>

<p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeaMbW05tP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> As the conclusion of the Life-study of Exodus, in this message and the following we shall consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38155" data-verses="Exodus 40:1-38">40:1-38</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bRFi3NCZne1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> In Exodus we have the record of God’s revelation concerning the tabernacle and its furniture and also the record of the making of the tabernacle and its furniture. In chapter forty of Exodus we have two records. The first is God’s commandment concerning the erecting of the tabernacle and the placement of the furniture and utensils. The second record describes how Moses did everything according to God’s commandment. These two records, of course, are almost exactly the same. In the book of Exodus there are actually four records related to the tabernacle and its furniture and utensils. In the foregoing message we pointed out the reason for the difference in sequence between the record of the revelation of the tabernacle and its furniture and the record concerning the making of the tabernacle and its furniture. Here I would like to point out that in each of the four records the most important matter is the ark of the testimony. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJp5cO-3Hiqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h">GOD’S SIDE AND OUR SIDE</h2><p data-content-id="c9a9fncUzMAkXCbwhgRE3LKguxmTX_m2DY94vKR1TXJkMjMOBd3_tXezQtNDn1ZMO"> We have seen that the revelation of the tabernacle and its furniture begins with the ark of the testimony. God begins with the ark of the testimony and then proceeds outward to the outer court. But according to our experience, we begin with the altar of burnt offering and proceed onward until we reach the ark. Here we see the contrast between God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="1942" id="1942">[1942]</span> viewpoint and our viewpoint, between God’s end and our end. God begins with the ark of the testimony, and we begin with the altar of burnt offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="jnwt71DiVbO7TXaWVoW8Soq-JiqTp0PXiPdiu3NjjeECG_96eL2tvB6UnyliVNnCN"> If we compare the books of Romans and Ephesians, we shall also see a contrast between God’s side and our side, between God’s end and our end. The book of Romans begins with our side, with the situation of fallen man. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38156" data-verses="Romans 1:1">Romans 1</span> there is detail concerning the sinful things, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38157" data-verses="Romans 3:1">Romans 3</span> we see the altar. Ephesians, however, begins from God’s side. Even in the first chapter of Ephesians we can see God’s intention. This means that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38158" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span> we see Christ as the ark of testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="T0TNjVoH1KcjYDNVVBj5M43HIH4FazV2zsPc5jAS5s3vbekLoCk23b8Znithp23wP"> As far as the tabernacle and its furniture are concerned, the book of Exodus does not begin from our side and proceed to God’s side. Rather, it begins from God’s side and proceeds to our side. </p>
<p data-content-id="nWG_VdipfAU6L3DCB6_fdwF28SNcnAnFD1a3DPAwvKca2N762PwVSz7t0NUT-I1b5"> God is in the heavens, and we are on earth. We need to ask not only how we can reach God, but also how God can reach us. It is not an easy matter for God to reach us. However, some may say that because God is sovereign and almighty, He can do whatever He desires and can easily reach us. It is, of course, true that God is sovereign and almighty. But we need to remember that God is not lawless; rather, He is a God of law, regulation, and order. Because God is an orderly God, He cannot act contrary to His nature. He cannot do anything that is contrary to His righteous way. In order for the holy and righteous God to reach man, He must act in a way that matches His holiness and corresponds to His righteousness. Therefore, in order for God to come from heaven to earth to reach us, His righteousness must be upheld, and His holiness must be honored. This means that God cannot come to us in a careless way. God’s coming requires a number of steps, or turns, from the ark in the Holy of Holies to the altar in the outer court. These turns can be compared to the turns one makes in driving a car. The driver of a car may first turn right and then left, but all these turns are necessary for him to reach his destination. Likewise, within the tabernacle there are a number of turns. <span class="pg" data-page-id="1943" id="1943">[1943]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6ygW0c0NczFgSVOu17vRnStrhF6d_sC3yzI4Jw12mcw-apUBNbdoK_zRAbIVFuK52">GOD’S INTENTION TO HAVE THE ARK</h2><p data-content-id="RjHF8tPTUVqVJDSNfI4bkZ407VCuewOoOrbRYy4I_DI76E1GnPhT2WjTMrgd3DBGS"> The book of Exodus reveals that God’s intention is to have the ark. This ark is the ark of testimony, and this causes the tabernacle to become the tabernacle of testimony. What God wants is the ark of testimony in the tabernacle of testimony. We, however, may want nothing more than our own salvation. Because we care for our salvation, we may not have any thought concerning God’s testimony. Our salvation is at the altar, but God’s testimony is at the ark. Most of today’s Christians do not have any idea about God’s testimony. They are mainly concerned with their salvation. If you were to talk with them about other matters in the Word of God, they may say, “Does this have something to do with my salvation? Will this determine whether I go to heaven?” This is the way many Christians view things. Today’s Christians do not have much thought regarding God’s testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOGL-CZTb0omyvmTdLNL23Jf6AP8_ymPqvmBe6lqbvQ24rOJ7TfrCCgx3bbA0Gty8"> Do you know what is the main subject of the book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible? In answer to this question, some Christians would say that Revelation is a book of prophecy that tells us about a beast that comes from the sea and another beast that comes from the land. But this is not the main subject of Revelation. In the <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38159" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">first chapter of Revelation</span> we see the main subject of this book—the testimony of Jesus. The last book of the Bible is concerned with the testimony of Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="wEf4Kqi8x2KOUZU-z_cypjjkmdlAeluJvr00agk4lZTCjiWWB0XS5YTn40-CVMbqS"> Once again we must appreciate the wonderful fact that the Bible truly is the divine revelation. The human mind is not capable of composing such a book. </p>
<p data-content-id="LVsUoIczLeuXD2p1Q3pzr2iJ92EyR53qAiTclG8vNhxZXwjNOkf0bpRjGNYC5R9iA"> Eventually, in the last of the sixty-six books of the Bible, we have a book concerned with the testimony of Jesus. This testimony is the ark of God. According to Revelation, the ark of God eventually consummates in a tabernacle which will be the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate fulfillment of the tabernacle. It is God’s eternal goal to have the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrP2zs_66HfK_zpZgsc5nAOvN1w9foTT35_-_R0b2nABdY4Mh_Mug5DNGQ93guKEm"> In our reading of the book of Exodus, we need to pay careful attention to the significance of the ark of testimony. I hope that all the young people especially will see the importance of <span class="pg" data-page-id="1944" id="1944">[1944]</span> the ark of testimony in this book. In reading and studying the Word of God, we should not be controlled by our natural mind, religion, or culture. We should not merely be concerned with receiving some kind of blessing from God. We need to see that what God desires is the ark of testimony in the tabernacle of testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZJbQ4T6HW6A0ZGb-6zC85X4-H5C81I3ru12RvxEoweid7BSsJrbvpoF0yxXO9USDO"> In the revelation of the tabernacle and its furniture, the ark is mentioned first. In the making of the tabernacle and the furniture and in the two records concerning this matter in chapter forty, the ark of testimony also has a central place. We have seen that the ark of testimony typifies Christ. The first item of furniture to be put into the tabernacle was the ark. The ark, therefore, is the central item of the tabernacle and its furniture. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AX0yNwXc01G2cetpBmTfBAwBAX1FgdMkY9mGyJ4wQTnRxvGpX-3Xbp-XP1C7zE23O">TWO BEGINNINGS</h2><p data-content-id="Fq6DLwnvkRmqnUugSNG4MKu1J3Rnl0SVAq7HMu33B99ClRHsYHrHB2-nh2FQ1NLFF"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38160" data-verses="Exodus 40:2">Exodus 40:2</span> says, “On the first day of the first month you shall raise up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.” It is very significant that God commanded Moses to erect the tabernacle on the first day of the first month of the second year. We know that the first month of the first year was the time of the Passover. Hence, from the Passover to the erection of the tabernacle was one year. </p>
<p data-content-id="CpO5aPS7sbE58cWlF1m9OL4CPoSQ6vyp-HoF426CM8nTjNQjnRKX4UCHs0aU1mEzP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38161" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38162" data-verses="Exodus 40:1">40</span> we see that God’s people had two beginnings. The first beginning was with the Passover, which was for the salvation of the children of Israel. The second beginning was their beginning with God’s dwelling place. These two beginnings are clear types or signs. The first beginning is to be saved, to experience the Passover, to have God’s judgment pass over us. Every genuine Christian has experienced this beginning. But what about the second beginning, the beginning related to the building of God’s dwelling place? It is a fact that not many Christians realize the need to have this second beginning. </p>

Regarding the erection of the tabernacle, we see the following sequence: the raising up of the boards (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38190" data-verses="Exodus 40:18">v. 18</span>); spreading the curtains and the coverings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38191" data-verses="Exodus 40:19">v. 19</span>); placing the ark of the testimony into the Holy of Holies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38192" data-verses="Exodus 40:20-21">vv. 20-21a</span>); putting up the veil to cover the ark of the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38193" data-verses="Exodus 40:21">v. 21b</span>); placing the table in the Holy Place on the north side, outside the veil, and setting in order upon it the bread before the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38194" data-verses="Exodus 40:22-23">vv. 22-23</span>); placing the lampstand in the Holy Place, opposite the table, on the south side, and lighting the lamps before the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38195" data-verses="Exodus 40:24-25">vv. 24-25</span>); placing the golden altar in the Holy Place before the veil and burning upon it the incense of fragrant spices (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38196" data-verses="Exodus 40:26-27">vv. 26-27</span>); putting up the curtain of the door of the tabernacle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38197" data-verses="Exodus 40:28">v. 28</span>); placing the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle and offering upon it the burnt offering and the meal offering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38198" data-verses="Exodus 40:29">v. 29</span>); placing the laver between the tabernacle and the altar and putting water there for washing the hands and the feet of the priests (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38199" data-verses="Exodus 40:30-32">vv. 30-32</span>); raising up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38200" data-verses="Exodus 40:33">v. 33a</span>); and hanging up the curtain of the gate of the court (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38201" data-verses="Exodus 40:33">v. 33b</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="1950" id="1950">[1950]</span> </p>

The cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory filled the tabernacle. The same structure was both the tent of meeting and the tabernacle. With respect to man, it was the tent of meeting. But with respect to God, it was the tabernacle. We may also say that outwardly it was the tent of meeting and that inwardly it was the tabernacle. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYXLE5s9fVmQ8Jn8bV9MupplJQHJzE8XI-ZLHBsaBJd6NMEmjAee1O4aEDy42Qyd0"> In the church life today there is a difference between the tent of meeting and the tabernacle. We may have the church life and be in the church life, but we may be on the outside and not on the inside. This means that our church life may be merely the tent of meeting, not the tabernacle. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZ3Vp-BjpsUTcDMKJQrCl9pBwZfVgz0o2DeXoFRjvXRgfOtiJ9iIsr_cKciRbJItR"> If we study the book of Exodus carefully, we shall see that the first mention of the tent of meeting was shortly after the children of Israel practiced idolatry by making a golden calf and worshipping it. Moses moved his tent outside the camp, and then his tent became the tent of meeting. </p>
<p data-content-id="d7PAILzwbE07UOjUermLZ8HkqvJfkzHc29BKWVZy5flIrP7FH80EH8iUCglvpo8mZ"> In the church life we may simply be gathered around the tent of meeting. We may not be in the tabernacle. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38204" data-verses="Exodus 40:1">Exodus 40</span> the tent of meeting was covered by the cloud, but the tabernacle was filled with glory. Those who only gather around the tent of meeting may have the cloud. However, we need to enjoy not only the cloud upon the tent of meeting, but also the glory within the tabernacle. </p>
<p data-content-id="QCrRcyWbDPBHUJatjTnGxhuRr9fiyenWdyNW8liG3Yx4l1D4HuClXlUQPXnWVF3CQ"> By the Lord’s mercy I can testify that during the early years I was under the cloud, but today I am inside the tabernacle that is filled with glory. No longer is my enjoyment only that of the cloud, but it is also that of the glory. How about you? Are you enjoying only the cloud upon the tent of meeting, or are you also enjoying the glory within the tabernacle? Certain saints who are very happy and bubbling in the church life may be under the cloud, not in the glory. Such <span class="pg" data-page-id="1951" id="1951">[1951]</span> saints need more experience of the church life in order to enter into the tabernacle and see the glory that is inside. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="KV2otT9EgDQ49pAxCEyNM_i00PaoTe7Gkz3egiVaPaVZAXGObYPpJQEqUaOtl1DAB">The Tent of Meeting and the Tabernacle</h2><p data-content-id="lZXJNVKjFJ2hn79Xk-D0kwsMx6qQizHn8wVx6tzgwBimRK-M0PHjsf6Ju6pamnq0p"> The term “tabernacle” in the Bible refers to something deep concerning God and His testimony. The phrase “tent of meeting” is positive; however, the significance is not as deep as that of the tabernacle. The tabernacle is related to God’s testimony, but the tent of meeting is related mainly to God’s interest on earth and to His move. You may wish to keep this distinction in mind as you read through the Old Testament. Remember that the word “tabernacle” points to something directly related to God’s testimony and that the term “tent of meeting” points to something that is more outward, external, related to God’s interest and move. </p>
<p data-content-id="OrDBUGa4cge6qLkzhsNBQ-4HDaKzoZ9VUrG_MYfpN_EcTuW80p9r2MChmxjOiYqRE"> As an illustration of this distinction, let us consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38205" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">chapter one</span> of Leviticus. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38206" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1:1</span>, the Lord spoke to Moses out of the tent of meeting. In this verse we are not told that the Lord spoke to Moses out of the tabernacle. When we read this verse, we may think that it is a wonderful matter for God to speak out of the tent of meeting. Yes, God’s speaking out of the tent of meeting is wonderful. However, it is not as wonderful as His speaking in the tabernacle. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="46TeK6OrF8-_nRGYIpf8g_boqQmndUvLr396xZU2pA7USCYIxYCei2_RdaoDsjyWr">The Relationship between the Cloud<br/>and the Glory</h2><p data-content-id="oz1cJ5FNtlwc1HcN6HoeaMLWzpNP4mOojkpb5fGgAGJnZQcqkxuZPIiLEputc_Mky"> It is important for us to understand the relationship between the cloud and the glory. We may say that the cloud is the outer part, the “shell,” of God’s glory. By shell we mean an outer covering. If we understand the word shell in this way, we may say that an orange has a peeling as its shell, and we may say that the human body has the skin as its shell. The skin covers the body, and the body contains our being. But the shell covering the human body is not our actual being. Rather, our being is the spirit. Those who were outside the tabernacle could see the shell. Anyone who entered into the tabernacle would see not the shell, but would see the inward glory of the tabernacle. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kDgDLJEVMKWVOSif1bRFinNEJXe1Fc4aEOXEj8CzzP_ULKAVr7ptpa5cGs4Cy3-2"> The young people may enjoy the church life and testify <span class="pg" data-page-id="1952" id="1952">[1952]</span> how wonderful it is. However, they may be enjoying only the shell of the church. But this does not mean that they should give up this enjoyment. On the contrary, they should go on to enjoy the inward glory of the tabernacle. Young people, do not be disappointed by my word, and do not throw away the shell because you do not yet have much of the inward glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="GijPF4NdVb9CGT-uGYJp5ce-9VCqh8d0LZRDwAdGLAdadyc5ZDvDr5lHN3tXQdv1h"> I believe that many of us can testify that when we were in Elden Hall in Los Angeles, we were on the “roof” of the church life enjoying the cloud. Perhaps some would say that the church life in Anaheim is not as exciting as that in Elden. I agree. Nevertheless, we must admit that what we are enjoying today is something deeper and more inward than what we enjoyed in Elden Hall. We may no longer be on the roof enjoying the cloud, but we are learning to intercede at the incense altar. Anyone who intercedes at the incense altar is no longer in the cloud that covers the tent of meeting. Rather, this one is encompassed by the glory that is on the inside of the church life. I hope that more of us will see this and experience it. </p>

They may say to themselves, “Why are we not as fresh as we used to be? Why is the church life not so exciting?” It is good to be excited and it is also good to be able to excite others. However, it is mainly the young ones who are excited and exciting, for they are enjoying the cloud outside the tent of meeting. But it is difficult for the older ones who are experiencing the glory within the tabernacle to be excited. I can testify that as an older one I may not be excited outwardly, but I find it wonderful to intercede at the incense altar. How I love to enjoy the bread at the table and to linger at the incense altar! </p>

But if they want to see the glory, they need to come inside the tabernacle. The glory is not on the roof; it is within the tabernacle. When we come into the tabernacle, we shall see that the glory is there. </p>
