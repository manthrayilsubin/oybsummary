The Central Thought</h2><p data-content-id="lmP8wKYRQexdKnp0vAPTKN8kXMXxg0xfvtq5hz9tjAarkGjSdf1W0qWvd0mcLElWl"> The central thought of the book of Haggai is that the building of the house of Jehovah is related to the welfare of God’s people today and to the coming of the millennial kingdom with its Messiah in the age of restoration. In the Old Testament the house of God, or the temple, was a type first of Christ as the house of God individually, and then of the church, the Body, the enlarged Christ, as God’s house corporately. Thus, we should consider that Haggai refers to us, since we are the reality of the type. Jehovah’s dealing with the returned captives signifies His dealing with us in the recovery. </p>

Here we have the people’s excuse for delaying to rebuild the house of Jehovah. Their excuse was the time had not yet come for the house of Jehovah to be built. </p>

This tells us that if we do not have the heart to take care of God’s house for His <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> satisfaction, no matter how much we eat or drink or how well we dress ourselves, there will be no satisfaction. If we neglect the church, we will have no real enjoyment or satisfaction. </p>

When they brought it home, He blew on it because of His house which lay waste, and they each ran to their own house. Therefore, over them the heavens withheld their dew, and the earth withheld its yield (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60432" data-verses="Haggai 1:10">v. 10</span>). Indeed, Jehovah had called for a drought upon the land, upon the mountains, upon the grain, upon the new wine, upon the fresh oil, upon that which the ground brings forth, and upon man, beast, and all the toil of the hands (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60433" data-verses="Haggai 1:11">v. 11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="T4ZEgQSDFXuEtFhzv7DltrTpPzVw03VlDUqctWPghzNQliTvPSUYhuVO_Wi3TeMKF"> The word “run” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60434" data-verses="Haggai 1:9">verse 9</span> indicates that the people were busy caring for their own houses. Today some saints are so busy caring for their own houses that they have no time to attend the meetings. As we consider this, we need to realize that in the entire universe there is no such thing as neutrality. We must be absolute. We must either take care of our houses first or take care of the Lord’s house first. My point here is that we need to learn to save some time for the Lord’s interests. How many sinners are waiting for our visitation? How many saints, especially younger ones, are waiting for our cherishing and nourishing? We may excuse ourselves today, but we need to consider how we will answer the Lord Jesus when He comes. We may have many relatives who are unsaved. Their being unsaved may be our fault, not theirs. If so, when the Lord comes to settle accounts with us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60435" data-verses="Matthew 25:19">Matt. 25:19</span>), He will surely rebuke us. It has been difficult for us to get the increase, not mainly because of our environment but because of our excuses. </p>

Then Haggai, Jehovah’s messenger, encouraged the people with Jehovah’s declaration, “I am with you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60438" data-verses="Haggai 1:13">v. 13</span>). Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the spirit of Joshua, and the spirit of all the people, and they came and did work in the house of Jehovah of hosts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60439" data-verses="Haggai 1:14-15">vv. 14-15</span>). What a wonderful response! </p>
<p data-content-id="witZkQ39drIqduAOFMr2YYTikOyKeAzAy2dX8MfIYRf4k4dK11MIUfO1DwZYu1sPP"> I hope that all the dear saints will be busy in going out to visit people and in contacting their relatives, classmates, and colleagues for the gospel. All the saints should be occupied by the Lord Jesus in preaching the gospel, feeding the new believers, and taking care of others. I hope that concerning this the whole atmosphere and environment among us will be revolutionized. </p>
