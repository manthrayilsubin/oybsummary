AN ADVANCEMENT OF THE DIVINE REVELATION</h2><p data-content-id="zLs19c8l0fJmVCIlaXT2eNrO37Rx9xx4r18qhLGRHCQGX8rX56yBc-Lf9eVsYHyhn"> As we come to the book of Leviticus, we first need to have a general idea about the advancement of the divine revelation. All students of the Bible know that God’s revelation in the Bible is progressive. God does not reveal anything fully in just one book of the Bible. Thus, we cannot see a complete view of God’s revelation in one book. The divine revelation advances from one stage to another stage, from one level to another level, from one point to another point. Only when we reach the last chapter of the Bible do we have a complete view of God’s revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="abOlojkYEV6S5Nyw1iDNLhodVhZNdxNgoVyybWxTCvwbL9IKdQKnhKWGzjO26wOAP"> The divine revelation in the Bible advances continually. The Bible was written over a period of more than fifteen hundred years, beginning at the time of Moses and ending at the time of the Apostle John. Within this long period of time, the divine revelation was completed, and the books of the Bible were eventually arranged in a meaningful sequence. In tracing the advancement of the divine revelation, we need to follow the sequence of the Bible. Let us now consider how the divine revelation advances in the first three books of the Bible—in Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="bMciakEq1jnYyMA9zOc4fi_6CFBb40kBRXyiszf2beiMhuuovJ4PBc3b8Pwvp8oTA">A. In Genesis—God’s Creation and Man’s Fall</h2><p data-content-id="pOQyt1gjzS1vZpd150kJXgoeVoVtZeJdrM5O10orBdv0cPWAhLe2gIJMOqxTtjK6d"> The book of Genesis reveals God’s creation and man’s fall. According to Genesis, man fell step by step: from God to the conscience, from the conscience to human government, <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> and from human government to rebellion. In this rebellion man forsook God and turned to the worship of idols. After man rebelled against God at Babel, God gave up the created race; however, He could not and did not forsake His purpose. Therefore, after giving up the created race, God called out a new race, a selected race, beginning with Abraham. To Abraham God promised that in him all the families of the earth would be blessed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38220" data-verses="Genesis 12:3">Gen. 12:3</span>). Eventually the race selected and called by God fell from God’s selection and calling into Egypt, that is, into the world. </p>
<p data-content-id="vSQYV8H55L1lGrY7ZUxst6h7nhsi8mieBZUCxoEnjcViCSP5VYMPeX6RAh2edvmD6"> In Genesis we see that man fell from God to the conscience, from the conscience to human government, from human government to rebellion, and from rebellion to the world. Today’s world is the expression of man’s fall to the uttermost, for the world is the ultimate expression of the steps of man’s fall. </p>
<p data-content-id="WlA3awOYhU9znfuKt6dvGiqoUUY8C0tfDhtg3P_T8AseHPoPSWYPV6PMcXDqPbKl8"> The first verse of Genesis says, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,” and the last verse tells us that Joseph “was put in a coffin in Egypt” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38221" data-verses="Genesis 50:26">50:26</span>). In the first verse we have God’s creation, and in the last verse we have the issue of all the steps of man’s fall—a man put in a coffin in Egypt. This is the clear revelation in Genesis. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="2RckI5Ct4Iw0lfg0o-7qXnsUaetKMcK0dqFXHy3GZc1Qzj85J-8LmfOv-1xMzMlJ0">B. In Exodus—God’s Salvation<br/>and the Building of His Habitation</h2><p data-content-id="ugJdCXLu0ey6qT0teoiBGH7cGsymcqFo8Xz3Iczpu7TrQaSjH1QUlKlNLKEP00tlJ"> The book of Exodus reveals God’s salvation and the building of His habitation. Yes, the man created by God fell, and the man selected and called by God also fell. But God is God, and He was not disappointed. Nothing can stop Him or annul His purpose. After man had fallen to the uttermost, God came in to rescue fallen man. After redeeming His fallen people, God brought them to a point where He built them together to be His dwelling place on earth. Thus in Exodus we see two main things—God’s redemption and God’s habitation. </p>
<p data-content-id="f1SdNSV-jnmqSNmLFj2KduK6ElcbFoF0g5vVSa13IQ9kvvIAb-D_3fsbMnQfG6L1R"> The word <em>exodus</em> means “the way out.” What we see in the book of Exodus is the way to get out of man’s fall. Genesis ends with man in a coffin in Egypt, but in Exodus there is <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> the way out of this coffin, the way out of this box of death. This way out involves God’s redemption. God’s redemption is to bring us out of the coffin and back to Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="IcDSKk0-zyd2G7hWO-1B3c868IznjjtjBspMyxBYA_3Aefgwi8mVa14ggFd5zUntv"> In Exodus those who had been brought back to God were charged to build a tabernacle, a dwelling place, for God. This indicates that God is able not only to bring fallen man out of death but also able to use this man to build a dwelling place for Him on earth. Whereas at the end of Genesis there is a coffin containing a dead body, at the end of Exodus there is a tabernacle containing the living God. What a great advancement this is! </p>
<p data-content-id="HomP821jsfmQ8p43kMxD4q8qS34joTThflkEC69_mme9_M6bdRalURihY94i1Wws0"> In Genesis we have God’s creation and man’s fall, and in Exodus we have God’s redemption and God’s habitation. We praise the Lord that because of God’s redemption we are no longer in the fall. Through redemption we have been brought into God’s habitation, which for us today is the church. The tabernacle as God’s habitation in Exodus typifies the church. God’s habitation today is the church, and we are in it. </p>
<p data-content-id="XgZNVEXVlLg7OJdTmWIsMv5U2E3kmo8X5u0Ynp1K0k7DMJm_eLaooWZ29TKHlzJPK"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38222" data-verses="Exodus 40:1">Exodus 40</span> speaks of the tabernacle, but <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38223" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1:1</span>, which is the continuation of Exodus, speaks of the tent of meeting. These two terms refer to the same thing. The tabernacle is a dwelling place, and the tent of meeting is a meeting place. The tabernacle is for God’s habitation, for His dwelling, and the tent of meeting is for the meeting of His people. The tabernacle is God’s habitation, yet this habitation is also the center where God’s people meet. Hence, it is called the tent of meeting. The tent of meeting is a place for the meeting of God and His redeemed people. Today the church is the tabernacle and the tent of meeting. God has a dwelling place on earth, and this dwelling place is also a meeting place for us to meet with one another and to meet together with God. What is the church? The church is the meeting of the saved ones with the saving God. </p>
<p data-content-id="k1b_-LdFaDzH5eTjPaqBvcmPrKHYvaDHUrgPD1q4xSXGU2fRRcrs_GWJkW-01a5uN"> As soon as the tabernacle was built and set up, God came to dwell in it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38224" data-verses="Exodus 40:2">Exo. 40:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38225" data-verses="Exodus 40:33-35">33-35</span>). The God who indwells the tabernacle has become the God dwelling among men. God is no longer merely in the heavens. It is impossible for us to go <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> to the heavens to meet with God. But God came to tabernacle among us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38226" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>). This means that God became incarnated to be a man, and this man became God’s tabernacle on earth. God came down from the heavens and took on the form of man, and now God can be touched. </p>
<p data-content-id="JYgdOTAphL2MixIdDMe3gVg7nZqhPUwH83TVGMXXC5x0rPf1TViep-9RX2Pq_QKeG"> The four Gospels reveal that the God who was in the heavens and who was untouchable one day became a tabernacle, a man on earth. Having come down to earth, He presents Himself to us not in the form of God but in the form of man. Who is this One? Is He man or is He God? He is the God-man. Our God today is not only in the heavens as God, for He, the God-man, came to earth in the form of man to be a tabernacle. </p>
<p data-content-id="zLs19c8l0fJmVCIlaXT2eNrO37Rk2xx4r18qhLGRHCQGX8rX56yBc-Lf9eVsYHyhn"> The tabernacle in Exodus was enterable. By being incarnated our God not only became a man; He also became an enterable tabernacle. God destined all the children of Israel to be priests (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38227" data-verses="Exodus 19:6">Exo. 19:6</span>) that all might have the right and the privilege to enter the tabernacle, that is, to enter into God and dwell in God. In the Old Testament the priests could enter the tabernacle, and today we, the believers in Christ, can enter into God and dwell in Him. The New Testament speaks of abiding in God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38228" data-verses="1John 4:15">1 John 4:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38229" data-verses="1John 4:13">13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38230" data-verses="1John 3:24">3:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38231" data-verses="1John 2:6">2:6</span>). To abide in God is to dwell in God. The incarnated God has become our dwelling place, our home, as a place of enjoyment. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="abOlojkYEV6S5Nyw1iDNLhodVhZkVxNgoVyybWxTCvwbL9IKdQKnhKWGzjO26wOAP">C. In Leviticus—<br/>the Redeemed’s Worship and Living</h2><p data-content-id="bMciakEq1jnYyMA9zOc4fi_6CFB2x0kBRXyiszf2beiMhuuovJ4PBc3b8Pwvp8oTA"> In Leviticus we have the redeemed’s worship and living. We should not follow the common understanding of worship. According to the common understanding, to worship is to bow down or to hold a service with rituals. This, however, is not the denotation of worship in the Bible. In the Bible, worship denotes our contact with God to enjoy a common portion with God for our fellowship with Him. In Leviticus worship is a matter of contacting God by enjoying a common portion with Him. The issue of this is fellowship with Him and with one another in His presence. To do this is to worship God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> </p>

Exodus ends with the setting up of the tabernacle, and Leviticus begins with the offerings. Both the tabernacle and the offerings are types of Christ. The fact that Exodus ends with the tabernacle and Leviticus begins with the offerings indicates a direct continuation. Although Exodus and Leviticus are different in nature and in their points, there is nevertheless a direct relation between them. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="rCeQBKNuXLnpxNKjpL-6rcviTmEr1HB5ztp7_KErmZE1m7T-GugDdoJ0xk-AO9IMP">A.

The tabernacle was set up not only for God to dwell in but also for us to dwell in. In Leviticus the offerings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38239" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">chs. 1—7</span>) with the priesthood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38240" data-verses="Leviticus 8:1">chs. 8—10</span>) are ordained. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Slkwfbwd8WAXYyyQY7UU1NsY2w2jTLyLwR1_r8BaVpq62ItkpbBUwNo3LENsEhxaS">B.

Types, which are actually pictures, are also necessary. Both the tabernacle and the offerings are types of Christ. Christ as the tabernacle brings God to man, and Christ as the offerings brings man to God. This indicates that there is a <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> two-way traffic, a traffic coming and going. Christ comes to us as the tabernacle and He goes to God as the offerings. </p>
<p data-content-id="ehZiAV472AzUxzKg22tugFXMjhYJn3FEbtMfczCI5c6oYys5LccddxEzqypM7CPIR"> The tabernacle is a sign, a figure, a type, of Christ. It was through incarnation that Christ came as the tabernacle. The Word, which was God, became flesh and tabernacled among us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38241" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38242" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). Christ is the very God incarnated to be a man; hence, He is the God-man, and this God-man is the tabernacle. As the tabernacle, Christ brought God to man. Christ’s being on earth was a matter of God embodied in a tabernacle. Here we have one aspect of the two-way traffic—God coming to us in Christ through incarnation. </p>
<p data-content-id="5c5lLvOTxKbegnfVCkujIZCU2iZ6N8xQJy4GzCHBtPSGykqXudXnQpZPgRpmmqveb"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38243" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span> tells us that the Christ who is the tabernacle is also the Lamb of God: “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” Christ as the Lamb of God is the totality, the aggregate, of all the offerings. </p>
<p data-content-id="N1UwjLbqomFsD8Hs1MzRwX7oz_Dm1gZu-SP6P-yYnxUULR5dEvstQRid9lxUvJo_Y"> On the one hand, Christ is the tabernacle; on the other hand, He is the offerings. As the tabernacle, He has brought God to us. As the offerings, He is now bringing us all to God. Christ’s being the tabernacle is a matter of incarnation. Christ’s being the offerings is a matter of crucifixion and resurrection. Christ came in incarnation and He went through crucifixion and resurrection. This is the two-way traffic that brings God to us and brings us to God, making God one with us and us one with God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="tq7hKR37puDvUqPzDeSKSsL6gC_vOUnOB1sQ10OAzaUm598D1pDdUeNiY98sV6D5J">C. The Tabernacle Being Good for Us<br/>to Experience, to Join to, God, and the Offerings Being Good for Us to Enjoy and Mingle with God</h2><p data-content-id="huE1la_VvhqT-E_rMeCC-1o_EtVrXjHXdPzx2sbNshy0olh7DO3UOWL5zObECuN3-"> The tabernacle is good for us to experience, to join to, God, and the offerings are good for us to enjoy and mingle with God. To experience, to join to, God is to enter into the tabernacle. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, people contacted Him. Eventually, the disciples were brought into Him, into the incarnated God. Thus, the tabernacle brings God to us that we may experience, enter into, join to, God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Uy7vFEnwR55XavTnTo3EqFJS9pHwHdfDirVdCYDVpVTdtZKnpVBJGlLm1pEB8cOAx"> Both the tabernacle and the offerings signify Christ. The tabernacle signifies that God is in Christ for us to contact, to touch, to experience, to enter into, to join to, God. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> offerings are God in Christ for our enjoyment. By enjoying Christ as the offerings we are mingled with God. God in Christ is the tabernacle, the dwelling place, for us to approach, contact, enter, possess, and experience. God in Christ is also all the offerings for us to enjoy Him, to take Him in, and even to eat, digest, and assimilate Him that He may become our constituent. After enjoying the offerings and eating them, we enter into the tabernacle, and there we enjoy all the contents of what God is in Christ. It is a wonderful revelation that the Lord is the tabernacle and the offerings. We can enter into Him, and we can enjoy Him and be mingled with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="MPOCDFUKm8cVcjpGd7ROS35i63MKUGrsW0PImFA2Wzbc3DwzZLz1gDLcK7CSHAOA3"> Christ as the offerings is for our enjoyment because these offerings are edible. They can be eaten not only by God but also by us. We can enjoy and eat Christ with God. This mutual enjoyment can be compared to the mutual enjoyment we have in a feast where we encourage one another to enjoy all the different dishes. This co-enjoyment in a feast is a picture of our enjoying Christ together with God. As we are enjoying Christ in a certain way, we may say, “Father, I would like You also to enjoy this portion of Christ.” Then the Father may reply, “Child, I would like you to enjoy what I am enjoying.” This is the fellowship of mutual enjoyment, the fellowship of co-enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="V7B55sygWuttI4KoZ4bOSqho0H8Ydc2BybMHU3NWuBbXmv0xQiUlyWnEa-JNV4Dll"> Whatever we eat becomes us. If we realize this, we shall see that it is not wise to oppose the divine revelation concerning the mingling of divinity with humanity. Through Christ’s redemption and by His Spirit, Christ’s divine element becomes our food. After we eat this food, it is digested and assimilated to become our fibers and cells. Surely this is a matter of mingling. </p>
<p data-content-id="ivxFinYAwLQi2teoWLAO0sXUjaEC98tRoutdjeTon_4zq6XLkUjUpOe_VDOm3Pn7t"> The Bible reveals that the creating God became a man, the God-man, and that this man has become the offerings—the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, the wave offering, and the heave offering. These offerings have become food to us. This means that God in Christ is edible. God became edible by becoming the offerings. Through our eating of these <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> offerings, the divine element is mingled with humanity. Thus, Christ is not only our dwelling place; He is also our food to enjoy God and be mingled with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="187ceXh_NbRnYyu1mrKM_o0zZxjFnDgQKRD-2KHDg7OF95AMtokSZlUzK2LV54vgN"> Daily we may enjoy not only God’s presence but also His element, His essence, even His edible substance. Paul’s Epistles indicate that Christ is edible, but they do not give us the details concerning the eating of Christ. For the details, we need to come to the book of Leviticus. The Christ revealed in Leviticus is a Christ who is good for eating. Leviticus gives us not only the “groceries” but also the “recipe” for “cooking” Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="9XfKmc-D9mR_l4j2zl61bRPDR4yLE1EyjHCSkford0o6f2fHKljszhGKeM9npgLuc"> All the offerings are not only for us to enjoy God but also to have God assimilated into our being. This assimilation results in mingling. We need to realize that we are being mingled with God and that God is mingling Himself with us. The Lord Jesus as the Spirit is in our spirit, and daily He is mingling Himself with us. But this mingling depends on our eating Christ, digesting Christ, and assimilating Christ. Good food may be set before us, but we may eat the food wrongly and thus get indigestion. Likewise, if we eat Christ wrongly, we shall get spiritual indigestion. In such a case, we shall not assimilate Christ. We need to learn how to eat Christ, digest Christ, and assimilate Christ. Then we shall be nourished, strengthened, and mingled with God. </p>

<p data-content-id="67dOgBo1e70S3A3lNxA9Fxx9I41iF2q9yYLlBn7LhMEcWP1VC14MaUjBJJcP9KtDT"> Christ as the offerings is not only for our enjoyment but <span class="pg" data-page-id="15" id="15">[15]</span> also for God’s enjoyment. The burnt offering is altogether for God’s food, for God’s enjoyment. The offerings are not only for us to enjoy God and to be mingled with God; they are also for God’s enjoyment.

<p data-content-id="G8WifseOG75eXksZ0Xg3wn7IaetdI8YfLcO9OTK3bDlF2oEvqaaac2VQzRzH11-xg"> It is difficult for us to enter into the real significance of the burnt offering, and we admit that our experience of this offering is limited. Actually, very few Christians have the real experience of the burnt offering. We may have had much experience of the trespass offering and the sin offering and also some experience of the meal offering and the peace offering but only a little experience of the burnt offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="cEGQRZcEFdiSW_luPEGi_zuDl8CuWnBiAywbXPclmSQESewfF2_kdR7dnAPblMLTy"> The most fine and detailed types of Christ are in the book of Leviticus. Without <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38262" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">chapter one</span> of Leviticus, we do not have a way to explain or define Christ as the burnt offering. It is correct to say that the burnt offering is Christ for God’s satisfaction. But how could Christ be such an offering? This is not easy to explain. If we would know Christ as the burnt offering, we need to study <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38263" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="YDsRD7ifPw-lp8lc5xue-ret1PbtGOgMuQ4KkOc2H7hurUt1fU4NGccyn3CnOpDOB"> Before we come to this chapter, however, I would first like to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38264" data-verses="Hebrews 10:5-10">Hebrews 10:5-10</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38265" data-verses="Hebrews 10:5">Verse 5</span> says, “Wherefore, coming into the world, He says, Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me.” Here “sacrifice and offering” refer to the totality of all the different sacrifices and offerings. </p>
<p data-content-id="XgZNVEXVlLg7OJdTmWIsMv5U0E3kuo8X5u0Ynp1K0k7DMJm_eLaooWZ29TKHlzJPK"> There is a distinction between sacrifices and offerings. Sacrifices are for sins, and offerings are for gifts. If we feel that we are sinful and need to offer something to God, this offering for sin, strictly speaking, is a sacrifice. However, if <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> we bring something to God not for sin but for fellowship, what we bring is not a sacrifice but an offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="k1b_-LdFaDzH5eTjPaqBvcmPpKHYnaDHUrgPD1q4xSXGU2fRRcrs_GWJkW-01a5uN"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38266" data-verses="Hebrews 10:5">Hebrews 10:5</span> tells us that God did not desire sacrifices and offerings but instead prepared a body for Christ. This indicates that God intended that Christ would be the replacement of all the Old Testament sacrifices and offerings. </p>
<p data-content-id="JYgdOTAphL2MixIdDMe3gVg7lZqtNUwH83TVGMXXC5x0rPf1TViep-9RX2Pq_QKeG"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38267" data-verses="Hebrews 10:6">Verse 6</span> goes on to say, “In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You did not take pleasure.” This seems to be a repetition of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38268" data-verses="Hebrews 10:5">verse 5</span>. Actually it is an itemizing and definition of “sacrifice and offering” in the foregoing verse. </p>
<p data-content-id="zLs19c8l0fJmVCIlaXT2eNrO17Ro0xx4r18qhLGRHCQGX8rX56yBc-Lf9eVsYHyhn"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38269" data-verses="Hebrews 10:7-10">Verses 7 through 10</span> continue, “Then I said, Behold, I come (in the roll of the book it is written concerning Me) to do Your will, O God. Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You did not desire nor take pleasure in (which are offered according to the law); then He said, Behold, I come to do Your will. He takes away the first that He may establish the second; by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.” The “roll of the book” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38270" data-verses="Hebrews 10:7">verse 7</span> refers to the Old Testament. What is the will mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38271" data-verses="Hebrews 10:7">verses 7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38272" data-verses="Hebrews 10:9">9</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38273" data-verses="Hebrews 10:10">10</span>, and what is the meaning of the words “I come to do Your will”? Some Bible teachers say that this means that everything the Lord Jesus did and said was according to God’s will. This interpretation, however, is not according to the context. “Which will” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38274" data-verses="Hebrews 10:10">verse 10</span> refers back to “will” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38275" data-verses="Hebrews 10:7">verses 7</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38276" data-verses="Hebrews 10:9">9</span>. The will of God in these verses is to take away the first, the animal sacrifices of the old covenant, that the second, the sacrifice of Christ of the new testament, may be established. Therefore, God’s will here is for Christ to come to replace the Old Testament sacrifices and offerings. At the time Christ came, God wanted Him to take away the Old Testament sacrifices—the sacrifices of sheep, goats, and oxen—and to establish the New Testament sacrifices, which are Christ Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="abOlojkYEV6S5Nyw1iDNLhodXhZoTxNgoVyybWxTCvwbL9IKdQKnhKWGzjO26wOAP"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38277" data-verses="Hebrews 10:5-10">Hebrews 10:5-10</span> clearly indicates that the sacrifices and offerings in the Old Testament are types, shadows, of Christ. Christ is the reality, the body, of all those sacrifices and offerings. <span class="pg" data-page-id="23" id="23">[23]</span> </p>

This is also indicated in Leviticus, where the burnt offering is mentioned first. If we are to understand what the burnt offering is, we need to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38279" data-verses="Hebrews 10:1">Hebrews 10</span>, which tells us that as the burnt offering Christ did the will of <em>God.</em> We should not interpret the word “will” in this chapter in a way that is common, natural, or human. God wanted Christ to replace all the Old Testament offerings and sacrifices. This is God’s will here, and Christ came to do it. </p>
<p data-content-id="qrtD4k7nSUxKl3L1F9HYvF1O3nTPcWZnHU9tH7v7LVX2V0M-w6m_gV8s2EafX305n"> It was not a simple matter for Christ to replace the offerings and sacrifices with Himself. How could a man replace all the offerings and sacrifices? Consider the qualifications that were required and the kind of person one had to be. The person who replaced the offerings and sacrifices had to be one who was absolutely for God, even in every small thing. Anyone who is not absolutely for God in all of the small things is not qualified to do the will of God to replace the old sacrifices and offerings with the new, that is, to take away the first and establish the second. To take away the first and establish the second is to take away the old covenant and establish the new covenant. The will of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38280" data-verses="Hebrews 10:1">Hebrews 10</span> is to replace all the sacrifices and offerings of the Old Testament with the sacrifices and offerings of the new covenant, and to do this, one had to be absolutely for God. </p>
<p data-content-id="yM17TXa3OJ3JFUKUJNaJ-Z-AHZG5n-2qoV1tbp_R_HyvijpCtI2f4lXHS5dhDfOiX"> We have spoken often about walking in the spirit and about practicing being one spirit with the Lord. In big things it may be easy for us to be one spirit with the Lord, but this is not easy in small things. How easy it is for a small thing to break our oneness in spirit with the Lord! But such a thing never happened with the Lord Jesus. When He was on earth, there never was a time when a small thing caused Him to lose His oneness with the Father. If this oneness had been broken, then He Himself would have been in need of a Christ. Furthermore, He would have been disqualified from being the burnt offering, needing someone to be His savior. However, the Lord Jesus was absolutely for God, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> therefore He was qualified to be the burnt offering. It was a great thing for the Lord Jesus to do God’s will—to be the burnt offering to replace the Old Testament offerings and sacrifices. </p>
<p data-content-id="8CNj27OFWN_6qC9vAuBiiMuhPbkRWYeypGMeEZeM8id7MXFWLRMGZ4VnbbcHB5Ro8"> None of us is qualified to be the burnt offering. If we had been regenerated without having become fallen, it would have been hard for us to break the oneness with the Lord in our living. Although we have been regenerated, we are still living in the old, fallen nature. We may exercise our spirit to have a life that is one with the Lord, but often a small thing will cause this oneness to be broken. What, then, should we do? Instead of being disappointed, we should recognize that we need Christ. We need Him to be our burnt offering. </p>

As the sin offering Christ is for redeeming man’s sin, but as the burnt offering He is absolutely for living a life which can satisfy God in full. Throughout His life on earth, the Lord Jesus always lived a life that satisfied God to the uttermost. In the four Gospels He is presented as the One who is absolutely one with God. His divine attributes were expressed in His human virtues, and sometimes His human virtues were expressed in and with His divine attributes. When He was confronted, examined, and questioned by the evil, subtle opposers—the scribes, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Herodians—during His last days on earth, at certain times His human virtues were expressed through His divine attributes, and at other times His divine attributes were expressed in His human virtues. </p>

<p data-content-id="tq7hKR37puDvUqPzDeSKSsL6mC_2BUnOB1sQ10OAzaUm598D1pDdUeNiY98sV6D5J"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38303" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Chapters one through seven</span> of Leviticus do not give us the details concerning what Christ is as the offerings; instead, these chapters show us the way to offer Christ. Although <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38304" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1—7</span> tells us that Christ is the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering, actually these chapters do not tell us how Christ is these offerings but tell us how to offer Christ as these offerings. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38305" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1—7</span> does not speak of what Christ Himself is totally as the offerings. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38306" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1</span> speaks not of what Christ is totally as the burnt offering but rather speaks of the way to offer Christ as the burnt offering. If these chapters only told us what Christ is totally as the offerings, then these chapters would be merely objective teachings of doctrines. However, these chapters are not merely objective teachings, but they reveal to us the subjective experiences we may have of Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38307" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Chapter one</span> does not teach us how much Christ is as the burnt offering but teaches us how to experience Christ and then how to bring our experience of Christ to God. It is altogether a matter not of doctrine but of experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="huE1la_VvhqT-E_rMeCC-1o_CtVObjHXdPzx2sbNshy0olh7DO3UOWL5zObECuN3-"> If we do not realize this point, we shall be bothered by certain things in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38308" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1</span>, for instance, the washing of the burnt offering. What does it mean for Christ as the burnt <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> offering to be washed? A matter such as this becomes clear when we realize that this chapter does not tell us about Christ in His entirety as the burnt offering but shows us the way to offer Christ. What we offer is not Christ Himself in His entirety but the Christ we have experienced. </p>
<p data-content-id="Uy7vFEnwR55XavTnTo3EqFJS7pHRKdfDirVdCYDVpVTdtZKnpVBJGlLm1pEB8cOAx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38309" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1</span> Christ as the burnt offering is seen first as a bull (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38310" data-verses="Leviticus 1:5">v. 5</span>), second, as a sheep or a goat (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38311" data-verses="Leviticus 1:10">v. 10</span>), and finally, as a turtledove or a pigeon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38312" data-verses="Leviticus 1:14">v. 14</span>). This bothered me when I was young, for I wondered how we could have a Christ in different sizes. Of course, in Himself and in His totality Christ is of one size. Christ’s size is universal; His dimensions are the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38313" data-verses="Ephesians 3:18">Eph. 3:18</span>). Not even a bull can represent Christ in His universal greatness, in His dimensions. </p>
<p data-content-id="MPOCDFUKm8cVcjpGd7ROS35i83MKcGrsW0PImFA2Wzbc3DwzZLz1gDLcK7CSHAOA3"> Although in Himself Christ is of one size, in our experiences Christ is of different sizes. For example, a new believer who has been helped to know Christ to a certain degree may offer Christ to God at the Lord’s table. In God’s eyes what he offers of Christ might be a small pigeon. But suppose the Apostle Paul could be present in the meeting and also offer Christ to God as the burnt offering. In God’s eyes Paul’s offering might be a large bull. In the same meeting another believer, who has been in the Lord fifteen years and who has had considerable experience of the Lord, may also offer Christ as his burnt offering. In the eyes of God his offering might be a lamb. In this meeting Christ as the burnt offering is of three sizes. This does not mean, however, that Christ is actually of more than one size. In Himself Christ is of one size. The difference, then, is not in what He is but in what we experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="V7B55sygWuttI4KoZ4bOSqhoyH8YVc2BybMHU3NWuBbXmv0xQiUlyWnEa-JNV4Dll"> As we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38314" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1</span>, we need to keep in mind that this chapter does not teach us concerning the actual size of Christ in His totality. On the contrary, this chapter teaches us concerning the Christ whom we experience. Christ is eternally great, but in my experience He may be like a pigeon in size. After some years, I may be able to offer Christ as a lamb. If I continue to grow, eventually the Christ I offer as a burnt offering will be the same as that offered by Paul, <span class="pg" data-page-id="33" id="33">[33]</span> a large bull. This is a matter of experience, not of doctrine. The fact that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38315" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1</span> the burnt offering is of different sizes indicates that what is taught in this chapter is not doctrinal but experiential. </p>

<p data-content-id="j-jDcdhlkFZU8qlJLAj5ysDwpqYh-hfT2n3xMNxM3nxLGWTONa1r1tuZp-L9a064x"> Suppose an Israelite who had inherited a portion of the good land was a loose and lazy person, not tilling the ground or sowing seed and watering. At the time of harvest, such a person would not have anything to reap. As a result, he would not have anything to bring to the feast; he would come empty-handed. Like the foolish virgins in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38318" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">Matthew 25</span>, who wanted to borrow oil from the wise virgins, a lazy Israelite might have tried to borrow or to buy from others something to offer to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="TofT8HtRPh84NluTshenNJ4O-klVs9GX-6GWVXNVjM-AbkkrSnjYFGJ4XZJr1H9Yt"> Today many of the saints are like this. They are loose and lazy and do not labor on Christ, in Christ, with Christ, and for Christ. Paul, however, was different. He said that he strived, struggled (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38319" data-verses="Colossians 1:28-29">Col. 1:28-29</span>), labored (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38320" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:10">1 Cor. 15:10</span>), and even fought for Christ. Paul was a busy person; he labored more than all the other apostles, yet it was not he but the grace of God that was with him. Like Paul, we need to labor on Christ that we may have something of Christ to present to God. </p>

We surely must depend on the rain from the heavens. Suppose the heavens send rain, yet we do <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> not labor. What would happen then? We would reap nothing of Christ, and thus we would have nothing of Christ to bring to God. We need to labor on Christ that we may be able to bring something of Christ to God. This is not a matter of doctrine concerning Christ as the burnt offering but a matter of experience related to offering Christ to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="67dOgBo1e70S3A3lNxA9Fxx9O41uL2q9yYLlBn7LhMEcWP1VC14MaUjBJJcP9KtDT"> The Hebrew word that is translated as “offering” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38321" data-verses="Leviticus 1:2">Leviticus 1:2</span>, the word <em>corban,</em> means a gift or a present. What we bring to the presence of God becomes a gift, a present. If we would have a present for God, we need to labor on Christ and struggle, strive, and fight for Christ. To labor on Christ as the good land is to till the ground, to sow the seed, to water the seed, and to take care of the crop. This is to work, to toil, diligently as a farmer. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38322" data-verses="2Timothy 2:6">Second Timothy 2:6</span> indicates that we are farmers, the most diligent and industrious of people. As farmers, we need to labor on Christ. If we labor on Christ, we shall have something of Christ as the burnt offering to be a present for God. </p>

As lovers of Christ who would take Christ as our burnt offering, we need to experience His being slaughtered. Have you ever been slaughtered? Have you ever experienced Christ’s being slaughtered?

THE WAY TO OFFER</h2><p data-content-id="67dOgBo1e70S3A3lNxA9Fxx9P41LJ2q9yYLlBn7LhMEcWP1VC14MaUjBJJcP9KtDT"> Regarding the way to offer the burnt offering as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38336" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1</span>, there are a number of puzzling points. One of these points concerns the priests, who are serving ones. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="R36y4VgO7wqhNpNxDLl0OIeHxl1T5MnHC79X_ufmE0Wna47bAcYxxGOhmnV68pR00">A. By the Priest</h2><p data-content-id="8CNj27OFWN_6qC9vAuBiiMuhJbkReYeypGMeEZeM8id7MXFWLRMGZ4VnbbcHB5Ro8"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38337" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1</span> we often read of “Aaron’s sons, the priests” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38338" data-verses="Leviticus 1:5">vv. 5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38339" data-verses="Leviticus 1:7">7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38340" data-verses="Leviticus 1:8">8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38341" data-verses="Leviticus 1:11">11</span>). A number of verses simply speak of “the priest” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38342" data-verses="Leviticus 1:9">vv. 9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38343" data-verses="Leviticus 1:12">12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38344" data-verses="Leviticus 1:13">13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38345" data-verses="Leviticus 1:15">15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38346" data-verses="Leviticus 1:17">17</span>). The priests here are of three classes: Aaron, the sons of Aaron, and an individual priest, a priest who is singled out for service. As the book of Hebrews indicates, Aaron is a type of Christ. Aaron’s sons are types of the believers. In this chapter we do not see any actions performed by Aaron. Rather, here in relation to the offering of the burnt offering, we have the service of Aaron’s sons or the service of a particular priest. Whenever someone presented a burnt offering to God, the serving priests rendered some help to the offerer. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="0Mc2AjIjEcgnOIfYqSBXyGYXjncMnEwKUmlwVwYbl9P2sUtxfBsUTcI2aw4ETTmDP">B. The Offerings Differing Not Only<br/>in Size but Also in the Way They Are Offered</h2><p data-content-id="7KDrIgxvPeGxEknpu13p9NRZlL23CvFquTAbQrYdftQwur0W0NCp1o6e3TlKTMR6I"> The various kinds of burnt offerings differ not only in <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> size but also in the way they are offered. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38347" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1</span>, the burnt offering could be a bull, a sheep or a goat, or turtledoves or young pigeons. As we have pointed out, the differences in the size of the burnt offering indicate not that Christ Himself varies in size but that our apprehension, realization, and appreciation of Christ differ in degree. Surely a bull would not be large enough to represent Paul’s apprehension, realization, and appreciation of Christ, whereas even a pigeon may be too large to signify a new believer’s apprehension, realization, and appreciation. A new believer may be very zealous, but his appreciation of Christ is nevertheless very limited. </p>
<p data-content-id="_WsCu0UVGd8o3Q6ZANIAJepZjWd9K7Zx5OwRVVx1PunU7kpT6WA8gEA6LgK96lE05"> Having seen the significance of the differences in the size of the burnt offering, we now need to consider the significance of the different ways in which the burnt offerings were offered. The first two categories of offerings—a bull and a sheep or a goat—were offered in the same way. First, the offering was slain, not by the priests but by the offerer. Following this, the offering was skinned and cut into pieces. (The offering was not to be offered to God as a whole.) After the offering was cut into pieces, its inwards and its legs were washed with water. The offering was then ready to be burned, and it was burned completely. No part of it was rejected by God. This was the way to offer the first two categories of burnt offerings. </p>
<p data-content-id="BbO8eSfTx5R84H_f9kv8JKRRiG3Twcqg7Rva48wPNAlxcvoNCVQHbME6iRkopNA5y"> The way to offer the third category of burnt offerings—the turtledoves and young pigeons—was very different. With the offerings in the first two categories, the priest did nothing to the offering except dash its blood on the altar and lay the pieces of the offering on the fire. The slaughtering, skinning, cutting, and washing of the offering were done by the offerer. We may say that the offerer was the “cook” and that the priests were merely “waiters.” However, with the offerings in the third category, the offerer simply brought the offering to the tent of meeting, and the priests did everything else. The priest brought the offering to the altar, nipped its head, took away its crop, tore it by the wings, and offered it up in smoke on the altar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38348" data-verses="Leviticus 1:14-17">vv. 14-17</span>). This surely is <span class="pg" data-page-id="43" id="43">[43]</span> different from the offerings in the first two categories, where nearly everything was done not by the priest but by the offerer. </p>
<p data-content-id="xpuW_vPofBGDzDc22724t8RKd5jnW0BSr8301X99RY97AKbZvApQctIkumW21xaSQ"> We need to see that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38349" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1</span> the way to offer the burnt offering is very particular and peculiar. The way of offering differs according to one’s spiritual age and spiritual ability. Therefore, my burden in this message is to point out that the way we offer Christ to God as the burnt offering depends entirely on our apprehension, realization, and appreciation of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="rCeQBKNuXLnpxNKjpL-6rcviUmEO5HB5ztp7_KErmZE1m7T-GugDdoJ0xk-AO9IMP"> Spiritually speaking, the one who offers Christ as typified by turtledoves or pigeons has a limited apprehension, realization, and appreciation of Christ. Such a one is young in the spiritual life and therefore lacks maturity. He does not have much ability to appreciate Christ. In contrast to worldly people, who have no appreciation or realization of Christ, a new believer has begun to have some appreciation of Christ. However, he does not yet have the ability to slaughter, skin, cut, and wash his burnt offering. He can only bring Christ as a very small burnt offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="dUhqhQwKWbXKSbqvLKXmrZOTr6OXK9A-m0V4pRJtqQPpDGovAqJWJcKK1hwOATnaE"> A believer’s appreciation of Christ and his offering of Christ may be quite natural. For example, some believers may appreciate Christ as He is presented in the four Gospels, but this appreciation may be natural. Furthermore, their love of the Lord Jesus may be according to their natural understanding. This was my situation after I was saved and began to love the Lord. For the most part, my way of offering Christ to God was also natural. However, through the years my apprehension, realization, appreciation, and offering of Christ have changed. </p>
<p data-content-id="QrptJJxnlubdylPzgsOm36qsF-PH6LPyv1OlLurgtE73Y3Ur-McK8L5I1R7Ma9Rtr"> Those who offer Christ as a bull appreciate Christ in a deep and detailed way. Those who offer Christ as a turtledove do not have such a deep and detailed appreciation of Christ. Moreover, their way of offering Christ as the burnt offering is natural. </p>
<p data-content-id="Kbr2zMFu7prMv589VrFoje5KO-W_WbKZ7yQ9bjy8JdXHTAd4mjuWZo9eiEivMyu1q"> The Old Testament priests knew that in order for a turtledove to be accepted as a burnt offering, the turtledove had to pass through a process. It was necessary for the priest <span class="pg" data-page-id="44" id="44">[44]</span> to kill the bird, take away its crop with its feathers, and tear its wings. The taking away of the crop and the feathers indicates the removal of what is unclean. The priest did all that was required to process the offering. This signifies that to offer Christ as a turtledove is to offer a Christ who has not been processed by the offerer; it is to offer Christ in a natural way. Therefore, when someone offers Christ as a turtledove, this offering needs to be processed by someone other than the offerer. However, the one who offers Christ as a bull or as a lamb offers Christ in a processed way, not in a natural way. </p>
<p data-content-id="lo2rhE_cgAMwRI2ZJVIpYWq_0pSbj6e5Meoawkyfbmb_iVgZMNNND2h_d1VBdUhRD"> All the offerings were offered at the tent of meeting. Since the tent of meeting typifies the church, offering the burnt offering at the tent of meeting typifies offering Christ to God in the church meetings. </p>
<p data-content-id="OETCsjMBdqbNfrPdG1o4GALDIHA0LO7bMBYHie8kfs2o1Fr5FqXL4WjAzs30TDaPr"> As we have indicated, the size of a believer’s offering and the way he offers it depend on his spiritual maturity, capacity, and ability. Some saints may offer Christ as the burnt offering in a way that is not natural and with an offering that is not whole but processed. Such saints, who are matured and rich in the ability to apprehend, realize, and appreciate Christ, have had very deep experiences of Christ. They have experienced what is signified by the different parts of the burnt offering: the head, the fat, the inwards, and the legs. To experience Christ’s head is to experience His understanding, wisdom, and prudence. To experience Christ’s inwards is to experience His sensibility, affections, feelings, thoughts, will, intentions, and purposes. The burnt offering presented by these saints is an offering that has been cut into pieces. This indicates that their experience of Christ is detailed and also that their way of offering Christ to God as the burnt offering is not at all natural. </p>
<p data-content-id="4mdq3y0cOc3Dr86Vjcerq3eopY44FYlfe9OOpxJJ8hAcXLR1eihN1Srq4IoiphC0s"> Little by little, the matured saints experience Christ in detail according to the pieces of Christ. They have come to realize that the Lord Jesus lived a life of having His inwards purified by the Spirit. This is typified in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38350" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1</span> by the water. These saints have also experienced Christ’s walk on earth, a walk in which the Spirit constantly kept Him clean and pure in His outward contacts. In their daily experience, <span class="pg" data-page-id="45" id="45">[45]</span> they appreciate Christ as the One who was always being washed inwardly and outwardly, not because He was unclean but for the purpose of preserving Him in His cleanness and purity. This is the Christ they apprehend, realize, and appreciate, and this is the Christ they offer to God. </p>

<p data-content-id="Fv8eruG2C4An5ussdVnkAb4U19jkUBFRCDYUBaT7z4c3XGWu7IZmTcTRA2UgLmbJe"> The most crucial point for us to interpret and understand concerning the burnt offering is the difference in the way the burnt offering is offered. For years, Bible teachers have stressed the difference in the size of the offering: the bull—the largest size; the lamb or goat—the second largest size; and a pair of birds—the smallest size. It is easy for us to see the difference in size, but it is not easy for us to see the difference in the way to offer, although this matter is clearly recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38357" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1</span>. Even if we see the difference in the way to offer the burnt offering, it may still be difficult for us to realize the significance of this difference. </p>
<p data-content-id="CmWO4n8XWbzptjiYJJrutWL9OtwLGtdWPFMX_iz9FQow2HICWW0e_sbr39oUdQ53H"> In order to understand the burnt offering, we need to realize that whenever we present a burnt offering we review our experience in our daily life. Because the burnt offering, subjectively speaking, is altogether related to our daily life, to our daily walk, the presentation of the burnt offering is a demonstration, a display, of our daily experience. If we daily and hourly live a life of experiencing Christ, we shall have Christ as a burnt offering to offer to God. However, if we do not experience Christ in our daily walk, we shall not have Him as a burnt offering. Then we shall be able to offer Christ mainly as the trespass offering. The point here is that we cannot offer Christ as a burnt offering if we do not live Christ and experience Christ in our daily walk. </p>
<p data-content-id="PuyO3Sd3rtHDCrlUqHprqNkWurIl3ZNKJnWiDhMvDB-DvcclyKQkDsf8ThJYtKq9k"> Let us consider the experience of three brothers. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="50" id="50">[50]</span> first experiences Christ as a bull, the second experiences Christ as a lamb or a goat, and the third experiences Christ as a pair of birds. </p>
<p data-content-id="-PeHukwbm9F9hxNjtJPlj6vo7-HkJXPXqV79a6e9f-uRqp0PM1xtx1OvvtRGpg6pH"> The brother who experiences Christ as a bull lives Christ at every time, in everything, and with everyone. In his living of Christ, he first experiences Christ’s crucifixion; he experiences Christ’s being slaughtered on the cross. This is the real experience of Christ’s death, the real experience of being conformed to Christ’s death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38358" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Phil. 3:10</span>). This brother experiences Christ’s death in his relationship to his parents, wife, and children. In his daily life there truly is the conformity to the death of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="67dOgBo1e70S3A3lNxA9Fxx9M41uD2q9yYLlBn7LhMEcWP1VC14MaUjBJJcP9KtDT"> As this brother experiences Christ’s death in such a way, he will also experience Christ’s being stripped of His outward beauty. In the four Gospels we see that while our Lord was living on earth, He had the experience of being stripped of His outward beauty. This means that He was stripped of the outward expression of His human virtues, a matter that is closely related to His death. Therefore, as the brother experiences being conformed to Christ’s death, he spontaneously experiences Christ’s being stripped of His outward beauty. This experience is actually equal to being the object of an evil report (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38359" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:8">2 Cor. 6:8</span>). The Lord Jesus had many evil reports spread about Him, and these evil reports stripped Him of the outward appearance of His human virtues. </p>
<p data-content-id="R36y4VgO7wqhNpNxDLl0OIeHyl1yyMnHC79X_ufmE0Wna47bAcYxxGOhmnV68pR00"> Moreover, as the brother is conformed to the death of Christ, he will also be cut into pieces. This means that he will have the experiences of Christ’s being cut into pieces. Such an experience may be contrary to our expectations. We may think that the more we love the Lord and fear God, the more blessings we will have. Consider the situation with John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Lord Jesus. Instead of receiving blessings, John was imprisoned and beheaded. Consider further the situation with the Lord Jesus Himself. How much blessing did He receive? Was He not cut into pieces? The Gospels reveal that, as far as His humanity was concerned, the Lord Jesus was cut into pieces in every way. Not one aspect of His human life was left whole; on the <span class="pg" data-page-id="51" id="51">[51]</span> contrary, every part of His human life was cut into pieces. Therefore, the Lord Jesus is the unique example of one who was cut into pieces in every way. </p>
<p data-content-id="sA3DT0shgAyQDQA-p8ePSMOJYDAnHm6lmg0vdxCAVblltDJck0V84lLYhSpuxHAEb"> Being cut into pieces will also be the experience of those who follow the Lord Jesus today. This is why Paul says, “To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38360" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Phil. 3:10</span>). Living a life of being conformed to the death of Christ requires the power of His resurrection, because as we experience being conformed to His death, we shall be cut into pieces. Our whole being and our entire life will be cut into pieces. The brother who experiences Christ as a bull experiences this cutting. </p>
<p data-content-id="wC5_UtyIRPyB7WpxJOJXBMKOBb92CCN8AU3cnMbGoPMp8MiDs1CTFLNSZcpsTXlfK"> While the brother is living a life of being conformed to the death of Christ and of being cut into pieces, he will realize that he surely needs wisdom. A foolish person cannot live a life which is the experience of the life of Christ. Living such a life requires the highest wisdom. Human wisdom is not adequate; it does not avail. This kind of living requires the very wisdom with which Christ lived when He was on earth. The four Gospels reveal that the Lord Jesus is the wisest person who ever lived. Everything He did was right and was done at exactly the right time. He never spoke a wasted word, and He never did anything in a vain, unwise, or meaningless way. He was One who lived a life altogether in wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="LN8LqFsPX2mirpNVn3_Fl_N0KEwtfzowX3QYUfdcNcHOHUZ6TUtCG5uztkJS3CHT0"> This wisdom is typified by the head of the bull used for the burnt offering. The brother whose living is an experience of Christ’s life will experience Christ’s head; that is, he will experience Christ’s wisdom. Under God’s sovereignty, this brother’s family, including his parents, wife, and children, may be difficult to deal with. Since he lives in such an environment, he realizes that he needs Christ’s wisdom. In his relationship with the members of his family, he spontaneously experiences the head, the wisdom, of Christ. The wisdom by which Christ lived in relation to His family thus becomes this brother’s experience in his daily life. </p>
<p data-content-id="mqLFmiP5_8OCpZzE87Nge8sEkJOFTmqJWkZYIFBzM8DlynnVp33_qIBdunbYlLH9U"> The brother who offers Christ as a bull will also experience <span class="pg" data-page-id="52" id="52">[52]</span> the washing of the legs and the inward parts of the burnt offering. This means that the continual washing of the Holy Spirit as the water will keep him from defilement both outwardly and inwardly. As he is living a life of being conformed to the death of Christ, he will experience the Holy Spirit’s keeping, preserving, and protecting him from defilement. The washing of the Holy Spirit will keep him from defilement outwardly, and this washing will also annul the defiling factor of anything that may get into him from the outside. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZFdhXfV0GtQ7ozQy5uEoF65vy6rkIlqjdVAMW6C4PfTWSUVAOgHKQM3Y0B8x6f0De"> When this brother comes to the church meeting to offer Christ, he will offer Christ not merely as the trespass offering but also as the burnt offering. As the brother presents his burnt offering, he will slaughter it, skin it, cut it into pieces, and wash its legs and its inwards. His slaughtering of the burnt offering will be a review of his experience of Christ’s death. His skinning of the offering and cutting it into pieces will be a demonstration, a display, of his experience in his own daily life of Christ’s sufferings. His washing of the offering will likewise be a review of his experience of the washing of the Holy Spirit outwardly and inwardly, that is, his experience of the washing that Christ experienced when He was on earth. Therefore, the way the brother presents the burnt offering will be a display of his experience; it will be a review of his daily experience. Without the daily experience there could not be such a review, for there would be nothing to display or demonstrate. Everything that this brother does in offering the burnt offering is a review, a display, and a demonstration of his daily experiences of Christ. However, he does not offer his experiences to God; he offers the Christ whom he has experienced. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX99LAoSSDDp0sZ8GP9dslCymGo8sDOOXlVaDXIcuoHkKGg7wn__7mL30AgWcce-r"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38361" data-verses="Leviticus 1:4">Leviticus 1:4</span> says that the offering from the herd would be accepted for the offerer “to make expiation for him.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38362" data-verses="Leviticus 1:5">Verse 5</span> goes on to say that after the offerer had slaughtered the offering, the priests were to “bring the blood and dash the blood all around on the altar which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.” This sprinkling of the blood was for expiation, for propitiation, which is needed by every offerer. Because we <span class="pg" data-page-id="53" id="53">[53]</span> are still lacking in the sight of God, we all need propitiation. Hence, the first thing the burnt offering does for the offerer is to make propitiation for him so that God may be pleased and happy with the offerer. </p>

In the following message we shall consider our experiences of Christ in His experiences. </p>
<p data-content-id="XgZNVEXVlLg7OJdTmWIsMv5UwE3Bko8X5u0Ynp1K0k7DMJm_eLaooWZ29TKHlzJPK"> The second part of the title of this message is unusual, even peculiar: “Experiencing Christ in His Experiences and Offering the Christ We Have Experienced, and Offering Him to God as Our Burnt Offering according to Our Experiences of Him.” This part of the title has three points. The first point is experiencing Christ in His experiences; the second is offering the Christ we have experienced; and the third is offering Christ to God as our burnt offering according to our experiences of Him. Here we would emphasize the fact that we cannot offer to God a Christ whom we have not experienced. If you try to offer as a burnt offering to God a Christ whom you have not experienced, you will discover that this is impossible. What we offer of Christ as the burnt offering must be according to our experience. If we have experienced <span class="pg" data-page-id="62" id="62">[62]</span> Christ as a bull, then we can offer Him as a bull. But if we have experienced Christ only as two pigeons, we cannot offer Him as a bull, for we have not experienced Him as a bull. We cannot offer as a burnt offering to God a Christ who is greater than the Christ we have experienced. We have to offer Christ to God, but we must offer Christ according to our experiences of Him. </p>

Christ experienced many things in order to be a burnt offering for God. </p>

<p data-content-id="OETCsjMBdqbNfrPdG1o4GALDKHA4JO7bMBYHie8kfs2o1Fr5FqXL4WjAzs30TDaPr"> Another New Testament verse which refers to Christ’s being brought to the slaughter is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38398" data-verses="Philippians 2:8">Philippians 2:8</span>, a verse which tells us that Christ became obedient “even unto death, and that the death of a cross.” Christ was obedient as He was brought outside the city to the place of the slaughter—Golgotha. </p>

Being Slaughtered</h2><p data-content-id="o5HGAna4E3UbMG7NGiSbaPlpVm3RqYoLI3dKIr2iVbybx3hEM_7DGG6BX7Kk3dEPS"> After Pilate had judged the Lord Jesus and had found Him innocent, he wanted to release Him. But the people were shouting, “Crucify, crucify him!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38399" data-verses="Luke 23:21">Luke 23:21</span>), and their voices prevailed. Pilate, being fearful and wanting to please the crowd, sentenced the Lord Jesus to death. The Lord was then brought to the place of slaughter and was slaughtered on the cross. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38400" data-verses="Acts 2:23">Acts 2:23</span> Peter refers to this. “This man...you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to <span class="pg" data-page-id="63" id="63">[63]</span> the cross and killed.” For them to kill the Lord Jesus means that they slaughtered Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="3lBTmaq9moHRumeUlLI0z9-1Zbb9MhxeMZAEbbLWdHR7eQxL9TMP84tRESuFndxAt"> Many years ago I read an article about how the Jews slew the lamb on the day of Passover. According to this article, a lamb was put on two wooden stakes that were arranged in the shape of a cross, with two feet attached to one stake and two feet attached to the cross bar. The lamb was then killed. This indicates that the Lord’s crucifixion may have been a fulfillment of the way, in type, the Passover lamb was slaughtered. </p>

Being Skinned (Stripped)</h2><p data-content-id="cEGQRZcEFdiSW_luPEGi_zuDh8CLUnBiAywbXPclmSQESewfF2_kdR7dnAPblMLTy"> Christ was also skinned, stripped of the outward appearance of His human virtues. One example of this skinning is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38401" data-verses="Matthew 11:19">Matthew 11:19</span>. “The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a wine drinker.” Such a word spoken about the Lord Jesus stripped Him of the appearance of His virtues. He was not a gluttonous man or a wine drinker; on the contrary, He was a proper man with proper conduct. </p>
<p data-content-id="YDsRD7ifPw-lp8lc5xue-retxPbMFOgMuQ4KkOc2H7hurUt1fU4NGccyn3CnOpDOB"> Other examples of skinning, of stripping, are found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38402" data-verses="Mark 3:22">Mark 3:22</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38403" data-verses="John 8:48">John 8:48</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38404" data-verses="Mark 3:22">Mark 3:22</span> the scribes said of the Lord Jesus, “He has Beelzebub, and by the ruler of the demons He casts out the demons.” Beelzebub means “the lord of the flies” and refers to Satan, the Devil. Flies are living, but they are unclean. The scribes were saying that the Lord Jesus was unclean and that He cast out demons by the lord, the king, of the flies. What slander! In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38405" data-verses="John 8:48">John 8:48</span> the Jews said to Him, “Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?” A Samaritan is a person of mixed blood. Thus, the Lord Jesus was accused of being a person of mixture and of having a demon. This also was a kind of stripping. </p>
<p data-content-id="Eo8_f6xczFEz8Dhy4DUKmRXFodtjCuIMuEdkcPMoX47E1B39u_MgRBsuwxjcPeLGZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38406" data-verses="Matthew 26:65">Matthew 26:65</span> the high priest said of the Lord Jesus, “He has blasphemed!...Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy.” This too was a stripping of the outward expression of the Lord’s human virtues. </p>
<p data-content-id="DAXcbsbzMAWBUrvVTy0dqdzCQ2I4b5ymf8MzGShj-RTqJixX3OkvHHtouXshNnro9"> Finally, when the Lord Jesus was about to be slaughtered, <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> He was stripped of His clothing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38407" data-verses="Matthew 27:28">Matt. 27:28</span>). How shameful this was! Furthermore, when the soldiers had crucified Him, “they divided His garments among them, casting lots” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38408" data-verses="Matthew 27:35">v. 35</span>). This had been prophesied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38409" data-verses="Psalms 22:18">Psalm 22:18</span>, and it was fulfilled in the Lord’s presence while He was on the cross. What a stripping the Lord Jesus experienced! </p>

Being Cut into Pieces</h2><p data-content-id="ge3wnxIwGxa4rrtSyd1Wi9TjxOsMi5UCxwpTMeqQUEqdRe-NF0C2fsGQOIKlAT22Z"> When and where was the Lord Jesus cut into pieces? I believe that this took place when people spoke cruel things to Him as He hung on the cross. Consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38410" data-verses="Mark 15:29-32">Mark 15:29-32</span>. “Those passing by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross! Likewise also the chief priests with the scribes, mocking with one another, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save! Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe! And those who were crucified with Him reproached Him.” Those passing by twisted the Lord’s words concerning the temple and told Him to save Himself. Was this not a cutting? Surely it was. The Lord Jesus also experienced the cutting when the chief priests and the scribes mocked Him, telling Him to come down from the cross that they might see and believe. Even those who were crucified with Him reproached Him and thereby participated in the cutting. </p>
<p data-content-id="ehZiAV472AzUxzKg22tugFXMmhYFh3FEbtMfczCI5c6oYys5LccddxEzqypM7CPIR"> This cutting was prophesied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38411" data-verses="Psalms 22:16-17">Psalm 22:16 and 17</span>. “For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me....they look and stare upon me.” This prophecy was fulfilled during the first three of the six hours the Lord Jesus was on the cross. Before He was judged by God on our behalf during the second three hours, He was cut into pieces by men during the first three hours. Therefore, Christ was slaughtered, skinned, and cut into pieces. </p>

As a child the Lord Jesus grew and was <span class="pg" data-page-id="65" id="65">[65]</span> filled with wisdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38412" data-verses="Luke 2:40">Luke 2:40</span>), and He kept advancing in wisdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38413" data-verses="Luke 2:52">v. 52</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="tq7hKR37puDvUqPzDeSKSsL6lC_jMUnOB1sQ10OAzaUm598D1pDdUeNiY98sV6D5J"> In the course of His ministry, the Lord Jesus spoke many maxims and words of wisdom. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38414" data-verses="Mark 9:40">Mark 9:40</span> He said, “He who is not against us is for us,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38415" data-verses="Matthew 12:30">Matthew 12:30</span> He said, “He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who is not gathering with Me is scattering.” These words are not contradictory. The maxim in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38416" data-verses="Mark 9:40">Mark 9:40</span> speaks of outward conformity in practice and is in regard to people who are not against Him; that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38417" data-verses="Matthew 12:30">Matthew 12:30</span> speaks of the inward unity of purpose and is in regard to people who are against Him. To maintain the inward unity we need to practice the word in Matthew, and for the outward conformity we should practice the word in Mark, tolerating believers who differ from us. </p>

OUR EXPERIENCES OF CHRIST IN HIS EXPERIENCES</h2><p data-content-id="_WsCu0UVGd8o3Q6ZANIAJepZuWdcD7Zx5OwRVVx1PunU7kpT6WA8gEA6LgK96lE05"> The burnt offering is not a light matter but a very weighty matter. The Hebrew word translated “burnt offering” literally means “that which goes up” and thus denotes something that ascends to God. What is there on this earth that can ascend to God? The only thing that can ascend to God from earth is the life lived by Christ, for He is the unique person to live a life absolutely for God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fv8eruG2C4An5ussdVnkAb4U79j5eBFRCDYUBaT7z4c3XGWu7IZmTcTRA2UgLmbJe"> In ourselves we cannot live a life that is absolutely for God. Recently, I have had the deep sensation that even our holiness and our confession of sins are not pure but are dirty. We human beings are nothing but dirt. Whatever comes out of our being is dirty, and anything we touch becomes dirty. For this reason, according to the typology in the Bible, even when we come to God to do the most holy thing we still need <span class="pg" data-page-id="72" id="72">[72]</span> the sin offering and the trespass offering. Whenever I speak the holy word, I am deeply conscious of my need of the sin offering and the trespass offering, and I trust in the Lord’s washing and cleansing. </p>
<p data-content-id="CmWO4n8XWbzptjiYJJrutWL9AtwSNtdWPFMX_iz9FQow2HICWW0e_sbr39oUdQ53H"> The burnt offering indicates a life absolutely for God. Such a life is absolutely out of a pure source, with no element of the fall, no defect, and no sin. This kind of life is pure and holy. In ourselves we cannot live this kind of life. We have fallen to such an extent that we have become the world, which is altogether dirty. Actually, the world is we ourselves, and we are the world. Every part of our substance, our essence, our fiber, our element, is dirty. We could never be a burnt offering to God. Therefore, we must take Christ as our burnt offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="PuyO3Sd3rtHDCrlUqHprqNkWgrIA_ZNKJnWiDhMvDB-DvcclyKQkDsf8ThJYtKq9k"> As far as our situation is concerned, the burnt offering is for expiation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38455" data-verses="Leviticus 1:4">Lev. 1:4</span>). We need propitiation through the blood of Christ as the burnt offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="-PeHukwbm9F9hxNjtJPlj6vo1-HFAXPXqV79a6e9f-uRqp0PM1xtx1OvvtRGpg6pH"> To take Christ as our sin offering and trespass offering, there is no need for us to experience what Christ experienced. However, to take Christ as our burnt offering, we need to experience what Christ experienced. Offering Christ as our burnt offering is not effective unless we have had some experience of His experience as the burnt offering. We can offer Christ as the burnt offering only to the extent to which we have experienced Him as this offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="pOQyt1gjzS1vZpd150kJXgoecoVtdeJdrM5O10orBdv0cPWAhLe2gIJMOqxTtjK6d"> A person does not need any experience of Christ in order to offer Him to God as the sin offering and as the trespass offering. A sinner may hear the gospel, repent, and say, “O God, have mercy on me! I take the Lord Jesus as my Savior.” A sinner who prays like this will be forgiven immediately, for he is not required to experience Christ. The repentant sinner simply takes Christ as his sin offering and trespass offering. The situation is absolutely different with the burnt offering. We can take Christ as the burnt offering only to the extent to which we have experienced Him in His experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="vSQYV8H55L1lGrY7ZUxst6h7uhsi4mieBZUCxoEnjcViCSP5VYMPeX6RAh2edvmD6"> It took me many years to realize that our offering of Christ as the burnt offering cannot exceed our experience of Him as this offering. Concerning this matter, the book <span class="pg" data-page-id="73" id="73">[73]</span> of Leviticus had not yet been opened to me, although it had been opened in the sense that I had learned the Brethren teachings about the offerings. Eventually I was enlightened to see that the chapters in Leviticus dealing with the offerings do not reveal to us what Christ is in totality as the burnt offering but instead reveal how to offer Christ as the burnt offering. Our offering of Him is according to our experience of Him. If we have not experienced anything of Christ in His experience as the burnt offering, we cannot offer Him to God as the burnt offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="WlA3awOYhU9znfuKt6dvGiqodUY8G0tfDhtg3P_T8AseHPoPSWYPV6PMcXDqPbKl8"> Christ’s being the burnt offering altogether refers to His being absolute toward God. In all His experiences as the burnt offering to God, Christ was a real man who was absolutely for God. This was the reason He could be the replacement of all the offerings. His being the burnt offering qualified Him to be the sin offering. If Christ had not been the burnt offering, He would not have had the qualification to be the sin offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="2RckI5Ct4Iw0lfg0o-7qXnsUTetKIcK0dqFXHy3GZc1Qzj85J-8LmfOv-1xMzMlJ0"> As the burnt offering, Christ was slaughtered, stripped, and cut into pieces. Why was He willing to be slaughtered? Because He was absolute toward God. Why was He willing to be stripped and cut into pieces? Because He was absolute toward God. The reason we are not willing to be slaughtered, stripped, and cut into pieces is that we are not absolute toward God. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugJdCXLu0ey6qT0teoiBGH7cPsymQqFo8Xz3Iczpu7TrQaSjH1QUlKlNLKEP00tlJ"> Why do Christians still have problems in their family life? Why are there problems among the brothers and sisters in the church and among the elders and the co-workers? Since we all have been saved and love the Lord Jesus, there should not be any problems. It is natural for there to be problems among the unsaved people in society, but why are there problems among the saints in the church? The reason we have problems in our married life and in the church life is that we are not absolutely for God. </p>
<p data-content-id="f1SdNSV-jnmqSNmLFj2KduK6NlcbJoF0g5vVSa13IQ9kvvIAb-D_3fsbMnQfG6L1R"> Even in doing things for God, a married couple may argue and fight. A brother and his wife both love the Lord, but they may still quarrel, even about loving the Lord. They may also argue about offering money to God. One party may <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> want to give an amount of money for a certain purpose, but the other party may want that money to be given for another purpose. Sometimes a brother and his wife may disagree over what hymn to use in praising the Lord in a home meeting. Because of this disagreement, the meeting is damaged. This quarreling is caused by the lack of being absolutely for God. </p>
<p data-content-id="IcDSKk0-zyd2G7hWO-1B3c861IzrljtjBspMyxBYA_3Aefgwi8mVa14ggFd5zUntv"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38456" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span> we see that there was a problem between Barnabas and Paul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38457" data-verses="Acts 15:35-39">vv. 35-39</span>). It was Barnabas who had brought Saul of Tarsus into the fellowship of the Body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38458" data-verses="Acts 9:26-28">Acts 9:26-28</span>). It was also Barnabas who sought for Saul in Tarsus and brought him into the New Testament ministry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38459" data-verses="Acts 11:25-26">Acts 11:25-26</span>). However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38460" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span>, after gaining the victory over the problem of circumcision, they separated from each other. We may give different reasons for this separation, but in the eyes of God the problem was due to one thing—not being absolute toward God. </p>
<p data-content-id="HomP821jsfmQ8p43kMxD4q8qb34vuTThflkEC69_mme9_M6bdRalURihY94i1Wws0"> Because Christ is altogether absolute for God and we are absolute for God only to a limited extent, we cannot experience Christ as our burnt offering to the uttermost. We may be absolute for God, but we are not utterly absolute for Him. Therefore, we can offer Christ to God as the burnt offering only in a limited way. </p>
<p data-content-id="XgZNVEXVlLg7OJdTmWIsMv5U_E3oso8X5u0Ynp1K0k7DMJm_eLaooWZ29TKHlzJPK"> If we would offer Christ to God as the burnt offering, we need to experience Christ in His experiences, and then, according to our experiences of Christ, offer to God the Christ whom we have experienced. Suppose in our married life and in our church life we experience Christ in His being brought to the slaughter. If this is the situation, there will not be quarrels in our married life or problems in the church life. As long as we still quarrel with our spouse, we cannot offer Christ to God as the burnt offering in the church meetings because we have not experienced Christ in His experience of being slaughtered. If we do not experience Christ in His experiences as the burnt offering to God, all our talk about Christ as the burnt offering will be in vain. We will have no burnt offering to offer to God unless we experience Christ in His experience. <span class="pg" data-page-id="75" id="75">[75]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38484" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1</span> Christ’s wisdom is typified by the head of the burnt offering. We need Christ’s head; that is, we need His wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="cEGQRZcEFdiSW_luPEGi_zuDv8CLcnBiAywbXPclmSQESewfF2_kdR7dnAPblMLTy"> If we would take Christ as our wisdom, we must live Christ. The proper Christian life, a life of abiding in the Lord that we may enjoy His life, is a life of doing things not by ourselves but by Him. As long as we do things by ourselves, we cannot have the wisdom of Christ and He cannot be wisdom to us. For example, if you speak to your husband or wife and to your children in your self and by your self, Christ will not be wisdom to you in your speaking. If we <span class="pg" data-page-id="82" id="82">[82]</span> would speak and do all things by Christ, we need to pray, “Lord, live in me. I have been crucified, and it is no longer I who live. Lord, I don’t want to do anything by myself—I want to do everything by You. Actually, Lord, I would let You live in me and do everything for me.” When we let Christ live in us and do everything for us, He becomes our wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="YDsRD7ifPw-lp8lc5xue-ret_PbMNOgMuQ4KkOc2H7hurUt1fU4NGccyn3CnOpDOB"> Our problem today is that we want to live a victorious and perfect life, yet we do not live and act by Christ. We have the heart to live by Christ, even to live Christ, but we are not accustomed to doing this. On the contrary, we are accustomed to living ourselves. We spontaneously live ourselves without trying to do so and without deliberately exercising any part of our being. However, in order to live Christ, we need to exercise our entire being. </p>
<p data-content-id="Eo8_f6xczFEz8Dhy4DUKmRXFmdtvAuIMuEdkcPMoX47E1B39u_MgRBsuwxjcPeLGZ"> Concerning the matter of living Christ, the question is not whether or not something is sinful but whether or not we are the ones who are living. We usually consider whether or not a certain thing is sinful, but God considers whether we are living by ourselves or by Christ. When we lose our temper, we do something sinful. However, even if our behavior does not seem to be sinful, if we live by ourselves and not by Christ, sin will issue forth. When we live ourselves, we eventually do something sinful, simply because we are the ones living. But if Christ lives in us, we shall be victorious, and He will become our wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="DAXcbsbzMAWBUrvVTy0dqdzCe2I0Z5ymf8MzGShj-RTqJixX3OkvHHtouXshNnro9"> If we live Christ in our married life, Christ will be not only our life but also our wisdom. Whenever we find it difficult to deal with our husband or wife, we are short of Christ as wisdom. If we do not live Christ, we shall have trouble in our married life. The way to avoid trouble with our husband or wife is to live Christ and thereby have Him as our wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="Slkwfbwd8WAXYyyQY7UU1NsY9w2jXLyLwR1_r8BaVpq62ItkpbBUwNo3LENsEhxaS"> Christ is very wise. As He lives in us, He repeats in us His life of wisdom. In this way we experience Christ in His wisdom and live a life with Christ as our wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="ge3wnxIwGxa4rrtSyd1Wi9Tj_OsAk5UCxwpTMeqQUEqdRe-NF0C2fsGQOIKlAT22Z"> Concerning our experiencing Christ in His wisdom, Paul says, “We speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the <span class="pg" data-page-id="83" id="83">[83]</span> ages for our glory” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38485" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:7">1 Cor. 2:7</span>). God’s wisdom is Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38486" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:24">1 Cor. 1:24</span>), who is the hidden mystery (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38487" data-verses="Colossians 1:26-27">Col. 1:26-27</span>), predestined, predesignated, and foreordained before the ages for our glory. Christ is the wisdom of God, and He is the wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom, and the One predestined by God before the ages for our glory. We may think that this glory is something only for the future. However, if we live Christ and He becomes our wisdom in our living, we shall experience a little of this glory even today. </p>

The Lord Jesus was always a delight to God. On two occasions a voice from the heavens said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38488" data-verses="Matthew 3:17">Matt. 3:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38489" data-verses="Matthew 17:5">17:5</span>).

<p data-content-id="N1UwjLbqomFsD8Hs1MzRwX7o4_Dm5gZu-SP6P-yYnxUULR5dEvstQRid9lxUvJo_Y"> Paul experienced Christ in this way. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38490" data-verses="Galatians 1:10">Galatians 1:10</span> he says, “For am I now persuading men or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I would not be a slave of Christ.” Paul lived a life which was a repetition of Christ’s life, pleasing God all the time. His life, therefore, was a delight to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="tq7hKR37puDvUqPzDeSKSsL6rC_vCUnOB1sQ10OAzaUm598D1pDdUeNiY98sV6D5J"> We may think that Paul was extraordinary, that his living was incomparable, and that his standard is too high for us. Yet Paul told us to be imitators of him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38491" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:16">1 Cor. 4:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38492" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">11:1</span>). Paul was the same as we are. He was a human being, he was part of the old creation, and he lived in the flesh. Whether we imitate Paul in being a delight to God depends on whether we live or Christ lives in us. If we are the ones living, we cannot be a delight to God. But if we let Christ live for us and if we live by Christ and even live Christ, our life will surely be a delight to God. Whenever our life is a delight to God, we shall have within us a deep sense regarding this. We shall know that we are living a life which is a repetition of the life of Christ and which is a delight to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="huE1la_VvhqT-E_rMeCC-1o_PtVnRjHXdPzx2sbNshy0olh7DO3UOWL5zObECuN3-"> I believe that all of us have had at least a limited experience of this and have had the deep sense that we are <span class="pg" data-page-id="84" id="84">[84]</span> pleasing to God and pleasing also to ourselves. Quite often, however, we are not pleasing to God and thus are not pleasing even to ourselves. </p>
<p data-content-id="Uy7vFEnwR55XavTnTo3EqFJS2pH8BdfDirVdCYDVpVTdtZKnpVBJGlLm1pEB8cOAx"> What kind of life is pleasing to God? The only life that is pleasing to God is the life that is a repetition of the life Christ lived on earth. A life that experiences Christ in His experiences as the burnt offering is a God-pleasing life. Such a life is a delight to God. </p>

He who serves as a slave in this—in the kingdom of God—is well-pleasing to God. When we live a kingdom life, we live a life that is righteous and full of peace and joy. Such a living is a repetition of Christ’s life as the burnt offering, which is always a delight to God. </p>

<p data-content-id="ge3wnxIwGxa4rrtSyd1Wi9Tn2OsZr5UCxwpTMeqQUEqdRe-NF0C2fsGQOIKlAT22Z"> In the two previous messages we considered in detail the matter of experiencing Christ in His experiences and of offering to God the Christ whom we have experienced. In this message I would like to give a brief further word concerning our experiencing Christ in His experiences as the burnt offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="ehZiAV472AzUxzKg22tugFXIhhYsv3FEbtMfczCI5c6oYys5LccddxEzqypM7CPIR"> I am concerned that some may misunderstand what I mean by experiencing Christ in His experiences. When many Christians hear that we need to experience Christ in His experiences in order to have Him as our burnt offering, they may think that this is a matter of imitating Christ in an outward way, of taking Christ as an outward example and pattern and then following Him and learning of Him. This understanding is wrong. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5c5lLvOTxKbegnfVCkujIZCQ0iZbE8xQJy4GzCHBtPSGykqXudXnQpZPgRpmmqveb">TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT<br/>CONCERNING THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="ugJdCXLu0ey6qT0teoiBGH7YHsymYqFo8Xz3Iczpu7TrQaSjH1QUlKlNLKEP00tlJ"> In order to help you have the right understanding of experiencing Christ in His experiences, I would point out <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> that regarding this matter there are in so-called theology two main schools of thought. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="f1SdNSV-jnmqSNmLFj2KduK-FlcbBoF0g5vVSa13IQ9kvvIAb-D_3fsbMnQfG6L1R">Imitating Christ Merely<br/>in an Outward Way</h2><p data-content-id="IcDSKk0-zyd2G7hWO-1B3c8-9IznnjtjBspMyxBYA_3Aefgwi8mVa14ggFd5zUntv"> The first school, which is much more popular than the second and which is held by both Catholics and Protestants, teaches the believers to follow Christ and imitate Him altogether in an outward way. This teaching is illustrated in a famous Catholic book written hundreds of years ago entitled <em>The Imitation of Christ.</em> According to this book, a Christian should try to imitate the outward living of Christ. Much of today’s Protestant theology also speaks of following Christ, imitating Him, and learning of Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="HomP821jsfmQ8p43kMxD4q8uT34jsTThflkEC69_mme9_M6bdRalURihY94i1Wws0"> Certain verses in the New Testament seem to provide a basis for this school of thought. In the Gospels the Lord Jesus often charges others to follow Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38523" data-verses="Matthew 11:29">Matthew 11:29</span> He said, “Take My yoke on you and learn from Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart.” Furthermore, Paul exhorted the believers, saying, “Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38524" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">1 Cor. 11:1</span>). Such verses apparently support the teaching that to experience Christ is to imitate Him outwardly. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="XgZNVEXVlLg7OJdTmWIsMv5Q3E3kqo8X5u0Ynp1K0k7DMJm_eLaooWZ29TKHlzJPK">Living Christ</h2><p data-content-id="k1b_-LdFaDzH5eTjPaqBvcmLqKHYjaDHUrgPD1q4xSXGU2fRRcrs_GWJkW-01a5uN"> The second school of thought, which is held by only a few Bible teachers, says that experiencing Christ in His experiences is not a matter of imitating Christ outwardly but is instead a matter of living Christ. To experience Christ in His experiences is not to take Him as a pattern outwardly—it is to live Christ. Regarding this, Paul says, “I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38525" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>). Paul does not say, “I take Christ as my pattern and follow Him”; he says, “I have been crucified with Christ” and “Christ lives in me.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38526" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Philippians 1:21</span> Paul goes on to say, “To me to live is Christ.” Paul did not merely take Christ as his pattern and imitate Him outwardly. Paul lived Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="93" id="93">[93]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="JYgdOTAphL2MixIdDMe3gVg_mZqtJUwH83TVGMXXC5x0rPf1TViep-9RX2Pq_QKeG">LIVING CHRIST IN OUR DAILY LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="zLs19c8l0fJmVCIlaXT2eNrK27Rowxx4r18qhLGRHCQGX8rX56yBc-Lf9eVsYHyhn"> In our married life we may try to imitate Christ, or we may exercise ourselves to live Christ. Many Christians have been taught to follow Christ’s steps in their married life. For example, a pastor may advise a married couple, saying, “Christ never quarreled with others. Now you should follow His example and not quarrel with each other. If you are tempted to quarrel, you must remember to follow Christ and live as He lived.” </p>
<p data-content-id="abOlojkYEV6S5Nyw1iDNLhoZUhZofxNgoVyybWxTCvwbL9IKdQKnhKWGzjO26wOAP"> Suppose a brother takes this advice and determines to follow Christ in his married life and never quarrel with his wife. However, one day his wife begins to bother him, and the Devil tempts him to argue with her. He resists for a while, but eventually he loses his temper. This, of course, is a failure in following Christ. This kind of failure is very common among Christians. </p>
<p data-content-id="bMciakEq1jnYyMA9zOc4fi_-DFB670kBRXyiszf2beiMhuuovJ4PBc3b8Pwvp8oTA"> A few strong-willed persons, however, are able to gain the victory over the temptation to quarrel. No matter how much they are provoked, they do not lose their temper. They have determined to imitate Christ, following Him not to quarrel, and by their strong will they succeed. Is this the genuine experience of Christ in His experiences? Certainly not! It is merely the practice of a religious teaching. </p>
<p data-content-id="qrtD4k7nSUxKl3L1F9HYvF1K0nTDaWZnHU9tH7v7LVX2V0M-w6m_gV8s2EafX305n"> I was born into Christianity, and from my youth I was taught from the Bible to take Christ as my pattern and follow Him. Later I learned the classical teachings of Confucius, which are very similar to the Christian teachings I had learned. I was bothered and began to wonder why we in China needed the foreign religion of Christianity to teach us the same things we had learned from Confucius. Because I was troubled about this, for a period of time I set Christianity aside. At the age of nineteen, I was saved. However, I still had a problem concerning the similarity of the ethical teachings of Confucius and Christianity. Confucius gave us certain good patterns to follow, and Christianity taught us to follow Christ as our pattern. What is the difference? I could not answer this question until I received help through the so-called inner life teachings. Then I saw that there is a <span class="pg" data-page-id="94" id="94">[94]</span> great difference between following ethical teachings and living Christ, and I began to see the vision of Christ living in me. </p>
<p data-content-id="yM17TXa3OJ3JFUKUJNaJ-Z-EEZG1h-2qoV1tbp_R_HyvijpCtI2f4lXHS5dhDfOiX"> Yes, in the four Gospels the Lord Jesus did say, “Follow Me.” This word, however, cannot be found in the Acts and in the Epistles. Instead of exhorting us to follow Christ in an outward way, the Epistles speak about being in Christ. Paul says, “I know a man in Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38527" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:2">2 Cor. 12:2</span>) and expresses the desire to be found in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38528" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">Phil. 3:9</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38529" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> Paul says that he has been crucified with Christ and that it is no longer he who lives but now Christ lives in him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38530" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Philippians 1:21</span> he tells us that for him to live is Christ. What a great difference there is between trying to imitate Christ outwardly and being in Christ, living Christ, and having Christ live in us! </p>
<p data-content-id="8CNj27OFWN_6qC9vAuBiiMulMbkdcYeypGMeEZeM8id7MXFWLRMGZ4VnbbcHB5Ro8"> In our married life, we need to live Christ. Suppose a brother is tempted to quarrel with his wife. If at such a time he considers how to follow Christ, he will be defeated. Before the temptation to quarrel comes, the brother should already be living Christ. He should be a person living Christ in his married life. If while living Christ he is tempted to quarrel with his wife, he will not quarrel with her. Because he is living Christ, he is living a life that never quarrels. This is altogether different from a strong-willed person making up his mind not to lose his temper. Instead of making up our mind not to quarrel with our spouse, we should live Christ, a life that is not ourselves, a life that never quarrels. </p>
<p data-content-id="0Mc2AjIjEcgnOIfYqSBXyGYTmncAlEwKUmlwVwYbl9P2sUtxfBsUTcI2aw4ETTmDP"> I am concerned that when some saints, especially the new ones, hear about experiencing Christ in His experiences, they may try to follow Christ merely in an outward way. If we try to imitate Christ, we shall be like monkeys trying to imitate human beings. We should not try to follow Christ. Rather, we need to be enlightened to see that in ourselves we are a hopeless case. We are “monkeys.” How can we imitate a man? We should forget about imitating Christ and see that we have One within us who is our life. This One is our Savior, the very Triune God, living in us. He is not only our life—He is even our person. <span class="pg" data-page-id="95" id="95">[95]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="7KDrIgxvPeGxEknpu13p9NRdgL27EvFquTAbQrYdftQwur0W0NCp1o6e3TlKTMR6I"> Our testimony should be that we do not know what it is to do good or evil; we only know to live Christ. We love Him and we fellowship with Him. Early in the morning, the first thing we do is call on Him dearly and lovingly, saying, “Lord Jesus, I love You.” Then we begin to talk to Him, to fellowship with Him, and to take Him in. To take Christ in is to eat Him. Then we shall enjoy Him, live Him, and be what He is. </p>
<p data-content-id="_WsCu0UVGd8o3Q6ZANIAJepdmWdxM7Zx5OwRVVx1PunU7kpT6WA8gEA6LgK96lE05"> If we are such persons, we will not yield to the temptation to quarrel with our husband or wife no matter how much we are tempted. We are now living another life, a life that can defeat the Devil and all the demons. This life is simply Christ Himself. Living this kind of life, a life that lives Christ, has nothing to do with religion, and it is absolutely different from the teachings of Confucius. </p>

The emphasis of the meal offering is on Christ’s human living and daily walk, implying His death but emphasizing His living. </p>

The meal offering emphasizes that Christ is righteous—righteous before God. In the burnt offering we can see Christ as righteousness, for <span class="pg" data-page-id="98" id="98">[98]</span> the burnt offering indicates that Christ is God’s righteousness. The meal offering indicates that Christ is righteous. </p>
<p data-content-id="Uy7vFEnwR55XavTnTo3EqFJW-pHwDdfDirVdCYDVpVTdtZKnpVBJGlLm1pEB8cOAx"> We need to differentiate <em>righteousness</em> (a noun) from <em>righteous</em> (an adjective). We may say that Christ is righteousness itself, and we may also say that He is righteous. The principle is the same with the words <em>sin</em> (a noun) and <em>sinful</em> (an adjective). On the one hand, we may say that we are sin, that we are the totality of sin itself. On the other hand, we may say that we are sinful. </p>
<p data-content-id="MPOCDFUKm8cVcjpGd7ROS35m53MKYGrsW0PImFA2Wzbc3DwzZLz1gDLcK7CSHAOA3"> When Christ died on the cross, He was made sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38533" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">2 Cor. 5:21</span>). The One who died on the cross was not just a person, Jesus Christ, but a person made sin in its totality. Because Christ was made sin, He took away sin from mankind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38534" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>), and sin as a personification was condemned (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38535" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Rom. 8:3</span>). This refers to Christ as the sin offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="V7B55sygWuttI4KoZ4bOSqhs3H8YRc2BybMHU3NWuBbXmv0xQiUlyWnEa-JNV4Dll"> Christ is also the trespass offering. The trespass offering is a matter not of Christ being made sin for us but of Christ bearing our sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38536" data-verses="1Peter 2:24">1 Pet. 2:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38537" data-verses="Hebrews 9:28">Heb. 9:28</span>). On the one hand, as the sin offering, Christ was made sin; on the other hand, as the trespass offering, Christ bore our sins. </p>
<p data-content-id="ivxFinYAwLQi2teoWLAO0sXQgaEO78tRoutdjeTon_4zq6XLkUjUpOe_VDOm3Pn7t"> We need to realize that as fallen persons we are not merely sinful; we are sin. Often as I have knelt before the Lord and prayed, I have said to Him, “Lord, I am not just sinful—I am sin itself. I am nothing but sin.” </p>
<p data-content-id="187ceXh_NbRnYyu1mrKM_o03axjJhDgQKRD-2KHDg7OF95AMtokSZlUzK2LV54vgN"> In the burnt offering we can see Christ as the righteousness of God, and in the meal offering we can see the righteous Christ, the One who is right in every way. Because Christ is God’s righteousness, He can be God’s satisfaction and give Him a satisfying fragrance. Only Christ can satisfy God to the uttermost. </p>
<p data-content-id="9XfKmc-D9mR_l4j2zl61bRPHS4yHO1EyjHCSkford0o6f2fHKljszhGKeM9npgLuc"> We also should be God’s righteousness, satisfying God to such an extent that we become to God a satisfying fragrance. But how can we be this kind of person? In the sight of God we are not righteousness—we are sin. How can we be a burnt offering to God? How can we who are sin be righteousness? In ourselves it is impossible, but it is possible by experiencing Christ in His experiences. </p>
<p data-content-id="j-jDcdhlkFZU8qlJLAj5ysD0sqYhyhfT2n3xMNxM3nxLGWTONa1r1tuZp-L9a064x"> In the early years of my ministry, young married brothers <span class="pg" data-page-id="99" id="99">[99]</span> and sisters who had a problem with their temper often asked me how they could be a good husband or wife. They did not want to lose their temper, but no matter how hard they tried, they were defeated. They wanted me to tell them how they could overcome their temper. Being young in the ministry, I had not yet seen the vision of living Christ. Because of my lack of vision and because I was still under the influence of certain books I had read on living the Christian life, I would tell them that they needed to love the Lord, pray a great deal, and memorize Bible verses. They took my advice and tried to follow it, but it did not work, and the result invariably was failure. They made up their mind not to lose their temper, but eventually they failed and lost their temper. Their experience, and mine as well, was like that of Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38538" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>: “To will is present with me, but to do the good is not. For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil I do not will, this I practice” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38539" data-verses="Romans 7:18-19">vv. 18b-19</span>). If today I were asked to help the saints in dealing with their temper, I would say, “You need to realize that you are temper itself. How, then, can you avoid losing your temper? The only way to overcome your temper is to live another person, the One who is not temper but the righteousness of God.” </p>
<p data-content-id="TofT8HtRPh84NluTshenNJ4K7klZq9GX-6GWVXNVjM-AbkkrSnjYFGJ4XZJr1H9Yt"> Apart from Christ there is no righteousness. He is <em>the</em> righteousness in this universe. If we do not have Him, we cannot have righteousness. Paul, speaking of the Jews, says, “They, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, did not submit to the righteousness of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38540" data-verses="Romans 10:3">Rom. 10:3</span>). Those who seek righteousness apart from Christ will never find it. As the burnt offering He is the very righteousness of God, and as the meal offering He is the most righteous One. He is fine, perfect, complete, and righteous in every way. </p>

<p data-content-id="R36y4VgO7wqhNpNxDLl0OIeD1l1-wMnHC79X_ufmE0Wna47bAcYxxGOhmnV68pR00"> The meal offering is made of fine flour. Fine flour, therefore, is the main element of the meal offering. This fine flour signifies Christ’s humanity. <span class="pg" data-page-id="100" id="100">[100]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="sA3DT0shgAyQDQA-p8ePSMONfDArBm6lmg0vdxCAVblltDJck0V84lLYhSpuxHAEb"> Christ’s humanity is fine, but our humanity is rough and coarse. We may appear outwardly to be gentle and nice, but actually we are rough. Among the human race Christ is the only one who is gentle; only He is the fine flour. With Him there is no roughness. His humanity is fine, perfect, balanced, and right in every way. From every angle—front and back, top and bottom, right and left—He is right. </p>

These processes signify the varied sufferings of Christ, which made Him “a man of sorrows” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38541" data-verses="Isaiah 53:3">Isa. 53:3</span>). In His human living the Lord Jesus had sorrow upon sorrow. </p>

This signifies the beauty and excellence of Christ’s human living and daily walk. Christ’s humanity is perfect. There is no comparison between His humanity and our natural, fallen humanity. </p>

Christ is a man, and as a man He has an excellent humanity. He also has the divine element, which is the Spirit of God. The divine element is in the Spirit of God and is the Spirit of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="PuyO3Sd3rtHDCrlUqHprqNkSprII_ZNKJnWiDhMvDB-DvcclyKQkDsf8ThJYtKq9k"> As the meal offering, Christ is full of oil. We may even say that He has been “oiled.” He has been mingled with oil. <span class="pg" data-page-id="101" id="101">[101]</span> This means that His humanity has been mingled with His divinity. </p>

<p data-content-id="2RckI5Ct4Iw0lfg0o-7qXnsQaetCIcK0dqFXHy3GZc1Qzj85J-8LmfOv-1xMzMlJ0"> Frankincense is sweet smelling and causes people to have a very pleasant feeling. In typology, the frankincense in the meal offering signifies the fragrance of Christ in His resurrection. </p>

This signifies that Christ’s humanity bears the aroma of His resurrection manifested out from His sufferings (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38546" data-verses="Matthew 11:20-30">Matt. 11:20-30</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38547" data-verses="Luke 10:21">Luke 10:21</span>). During the course of His human life, Christ suffered a great deal, but the aroma of His resurrection was manifested out from His sufferings. Although He suffered very much, He exuded a sweet fragrance, the aroma of His resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="IcDSKk0-zyd2G7hWO-1B3c8-8IzzljtjBspMyxBYA_3Aefgwi8mVa14ggFd5zUntv"> In the meal offering there are three elements: the fine flour, the oil, and the frankincense. If we study the four Gospels, we will see that Christ’s life consisted mainly of these three elements. The Lord Jesus continually lived and walked in these three things—in His humanity mingled with His divinity and expressing His resurrection. </p>

<p data-content-id="mqLFmiP5_8OCpZzE87Nge8sAgJOccmqJWkZYIFBzM8DlynnVp33_qIBdunbYlLH9U"> In the burnt offering, the main item is the blood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38555" data-verses="Leviticus 1:3">1:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38556" data-verses="Leviticus 1:11">11</span>). In the meal offering, the main items are the oil and the frankincense (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38557" data-verses="Leviticus 2:1">2:1</span>). The oil is for mingling and anointing, and the frankincense is to be put on the meal offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZFdhXfV0GtQ7ozQy5uEoF65r26rBElqjdVAMW6C4PfTWSUVAOgHKQM3Y0B8x6f0De"> The burnt offering is for expiation, for propitiation. We need propitiation because we are short in being absolute for God. Even if we have not made any mistakes or sinned and are perfect and complete, we still are not utterly, ultimately, fully, and wholly absolute for God. If we are not wholly absolute for God, we are short of God’s glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38558" data-verses="Romans 3:23">Rom. 3:23</span>). This means that we are sinful; we are sinful in not being absolute for God. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX99LAoSSDDp0sZ8GP9dslC2iGodhDOOXlVaDXIcuoHkKGg7wn__7mL30AgWcce-r"> God is our source. We were made by God for the purpose of expressing Him and representing Him. But to express and represent God requires our absoluteness. However, among the fallen human race no one is absolute for God. Perhaps some of us are absolute for God to a great degree, but we are not fully and utterly absolute for Him. We are not absolute for God like the man Jesus was when He was on earth. In the four Gospels He is portrayed as the One who is altogether <span class="pg" data-page-id="106" id="106">[106]</span> absolute for God. None of us can compare with Him. Thus, we are short of God’s glory and need propitiation. </p>
<p data-content-id="abOlojkYEV6S5Nyw1iDNLhoZWhZoXxNgoVyybWxTCvwbL9IKdQKnhKWGzjO26wOAP"> Propitiation is not only for redemption. Propitiation is also for propitiating the situation between us and God, a situation that is not peaceful. Propitiation appeases the situation between us and God and settles certain problems. </p>
<p data-content-id="bMciakEq1jnYyMA9zOc4fi_-BFB6z0kBRXyiszf2beiMhuuovJ4PBc3b8Pwvp8oTA"> For propitiation we need to offer Christ as the burnt offering. However, we can offer Christ as the burnt offering only to the extent to which we have experienced Him. In order to offer Christ as the burnt offering to God, we need to experience Christ in His experiences. </p>
<p data-content-id="qrtD4k7nSUxKl3L1F9HYvF1K2nTPYWZnHU9tH7v7LVX2V0M-w6m_gV8s2EafX305n"> Blood is needed for expiation. Only animals are qualified to be the burnt offering because only they have blood to shed for expiation. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38559" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Leviticus 1</span> the burnt offering must be a bull from the herd, a goat or a sheep from the flock, or turtledoves or pigeons. </p>
<p data-content-id="yM17TXa3OJ3JFUKUJNaJ-Z-EGZG5j-2qoV1tbp_R_HyvijpCtI2f4lXHS5dhDfOiX"> In the meal offering nothing of the animal life is seen. What is seen is of the vegetable life: wheat, grain, and ears of grain. As a type of Christ, the vegetable life indicates the produce, the propagation, and the increase to supply life for people to live by. In the meal offering we do not see blood, but we see oil and frankincense. The oil anoints the meal offering and is mingled with it; the frankincense is sprinkled upon the meal offering. Concerning the blood, the oil, and the frankincense, we have a very significant difference between the burnt offering and the meal offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="8CNj27OFWN_6qC9vAuBiiMulObkRaYeypGMeEZeM8id7MXFWLRMGZ4VnbbcHB5Ro8"> The offerings are food for both God and us that we and God may have mutual enjoyment. The burnt offering was entirely consumed by God; it was eaten by Him alone. God’s “mouth” is the fire that consumed the burnt offering, the fire, that burned continually day and night. The divine eating of the burnt offering was very orderly. This is indicated by the orderly way in which the pieces were arranged for burning (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38560" data-verses="Leviticus 1:7-8">Lev. 1:7-8</span>). God does everything, including the eating of the burnt offering, in an orderly way. </p>
<p data-content-id="0Mc2AjIjEcgnOIfYqSBXyGYTkncMjEwKUmlwVwYbl9P2sUtxfBsUTcI2aw4ETTmDP"> Because the burnt offering is for propitiation, it can be eaten only by God. Only God is qualified to enjoy something <span class="pg" data-page-id="107" id="107">[107]</span> that is for our propitiation. Therefore, we cannot eat the burnt offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="7KDrIgxvPeGxEknpu13p9NRdiL23GvFquTAbQrYdftQwur0W0NCp1o6e3TlKTMR6I"> Although we may not eat the burnt offering, we may eat a part of the meal offering. When a person offered the meal offering, “a full handful of its fine flour and of its oil, with all its frankincense,” were to be offered “in smoke as its memorial portion on the altar, an offering by fire of a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38561" data-verses="Leviticus 2:2">2:2</span>). Here we see that part of the flour and oil and all of the frankincense are God’s food. God must be the first to taste and to enjoy the meal offering. The remainder of the meal offering, consisting of fine flour and oil but no frankincense, was to be food for the priests. </p>
<p data-content-id="_WsCu0UVGd8o3Q6ZANIAJepdkWd9O7Zx5OwRVVx1PunU7kpT6WA8gEA6LgK96lE05"> The priests serve God. Their service is holy, and their food also is holy. If we would serve God as priests, we need to eat the priestly food, the holy food that befits our holy service. This food nourishes us that we may have the strength to serve God. </p>
<p data-content-id="BbO8eSfTx5R84H_f9kv8JKRVlG3T8cqg7Rva48wPNAlxcvoNCVQHbME6iRkopNA5y"> The meal offering is a matter of Christ as the satisfaction of God’s people enjoyed together with God. First, God enjoys His portion of the meal offering, and then we have our enjoyment. Our enjoyment is thus a co-enjoyment, an enjoyment that is with God’s enjoyment. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xpuW_vPofBGDzDc22724t8ROa5jna0BSr8301X99RY97AKbZvApQctIkumW21xaSQ">V.

This signifies that a considerable portion of Christ’s excellent, perfect, Spirit-filled, and resurrection-saturated living is offered to God as food for His enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="dUhqhQwKWbXKSbqvLKXmrZOXs6ObM9A-m0V4pRJtqQPpDGovAqJWJcKK1hwOATnaE"> Christ’s human living on earth was excellent, but it is difficult for us to say what this excellence refers to. We may say that it refers to the high standard of His attributes and virtues. How high is this standard? We cannot say. There has never before been such a standard among the human race. <span class="pg" data-page-id="108" id="108">[108]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="QrptJJxnlubdylPzgsOm36qoC-PLwLPyv1OlLurgtE73Y3Ur-McK8L5I1R7Ma9Rtr"> Christ is both God and man. He is a God-man anointed, mingled, and filled with the Spirit of God. Moreover, even before He was crucified, He expressed resurrection. He expressed resurrection in everything, even in rebuking the Pharisees (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38563" data-verses="Matthew 23:1-36">Matt. 23:1-36</span>) and in cleansing the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38564" data-verses="John 2:12-17">John 2:12-17</span>). The excellency of Christ’s human living on earth was in His manhood and in His Godhood; it was in His humanity and divinity in the Spirit and with resurrection. This is how the four Gospels reveal Him in His excellence. </p>
<p data-content-id="Kbr2zMFu7prMv589VrFoje5OJ-WzcbKZ7yQ9bjy8JdXHTAd4mjuWZo9eiEivMyu1q"> Christ’s humanity is perfect. He is fine, even, and fully balanced, lacking nothing and not having anything in excess. Furthermore, He is filled with the Spirit and saturated with resurrection. When He walked on earth, He was always filled with the Spirit and saturated with resurrection. </p>

As a Memorial</h2><p data-content-id="OETCsjMBdqbNfrPdG1o4GALHPHA0PO7bMBYHie8kfs2o1Fr5FqXL4WjAzs30TDaPr"> The frankincense with part of the fine flour and the oil was burned as a memorial because of its satisfying effect. A memorial is greater than satisfaction. We may be satisfied with many things but not make those things a memorial. But when we have the highest satisfaction, we will make that satisfaction a memorial. God enjoys Christ to such an extent that this enjoyment becomes a memorial. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="4mdq3y0cOc3Dr86Vjcerq3esuY44BYlfe9OOpxJJ8hAcXLR1eihN1Srq4IoiphC0s">B. As a Satisfying Fragrance</h2><p data-content-id="o5HGAna4E3UbMG7NGiSbaPltQm3doYoLI3dKIr2iVbybx3hEM_7DGG6BX7Kk3dEPS"> A satisfying fragrance is a sweet savor; it is a fragrance that gives rest, peace, joy, enjoyment, and full satisfaction. The rich elements of the meal offering—Christ’s humanity, divinity, and His excellent, perfect, Spirit-filled, and resurrection-saturated living—are a fragrance that gives God rest, peace, joy, enjoyment, and full satisfaction. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3lBTmaq9moHRumeUlLI0z9-xcbbxChxeMZAEbbLWdHR7eQxL9TMP84tRESuFndxAt">VI. THE REMAINDER OF THE MEAL OFFERING<br/>BEING FOR AARON AND HIS SONS</h2><p data-content-id="G8WifseOG75eXksZ0Xg3wn7MbetIL8YfLcO9OTK3bDlF2oEvqaaac2VQzRzH11-xg"> “The remainder of the meal offering is for Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy portion of the offerings of Jehovah by fire” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38565" data-verses="Leviticus 2:3">Lev. 2:3</span>). This signifies that we also can enjoy Christ’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="109" id="109">[109]</span> human living as our food after God’s enjoyment. First, God must be given His portion that He may be satisfied. The remainder is our portion for our satisfaction. </p>
<p data-content-id="cEGQRZcEFdiSW_luPEGi_zuHk8CDcnBiAywbXPclmSQESewfF2_kdR7dnAPblMLTy"> It is easy to say that we can enjoy Christ’s human living as our food, but how can we actually do this? Considering the type in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38566" data-verses="Leviticus 2:1">Leviticus 2</span> will help in answering this question. The type here is a picture signifying Christ’s human living. The fine flour signifies Christ’s humanity, and the oil signifies the Spirit of God. The oil and the flour are mingled to produce an oiled fine flour, a fine flour mingled with oil. Therefore, to eat the fine flour is to eat the oil; it is also to eat the mingling, for the oil and the flour cannot be separated. </p>

NO LEAVEN</h2><p data-content-id="ugJdCXLu0ey6qT0teoiBGH7YEsyDSqFo8Xz3Iczpu7TrQaSjH1QUlKlNLKEP00tlJ"> There is no leaven in the meal offering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38589" data-verses="Leviticus 2:4-5">vv. 4-5</span>). “No meal offering which you shall bring to Jehovah shall be made with leaven” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38590" data-verses="Leviticus 2:11">v. 11a</span>). No leaven signifies that there is no sin or any negative thing in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38591" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:6-8">1 Cor. 5:6-8</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="f1SdNSV-jnmqSNmLFj2KduK-Glc6KoF0g5vVSa13IQ9kvvIAb-D_3fsbMnQfG6L1R">X. NO HONEY, WHICH WILL FERMENT</h2><p data-content-id="9XfKmc-D9mR_l4j2zl61bRPHQ4yHG1EyjHCSkford0o6f2fHKljszhGKeM9npgLuc"> In the meal offering there is no honey, which will ferment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38592" data-verses="Leviticus 2:11">Lev. 2:11</span>). This signifies that there is no natural affection or natural good in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="j-jDcdhlkFZU8qlJLAj5ysD0uqYh6hfT2n3xMNxM3nxLGWTONa1r1tuZp-L9a064x"> Two things in the Lord’s recovery bother me. One is ambition, which I regard as leaven. The other is natural affection, which I regard as honey. Certain saints may claim that their love for one another is according to the Lord’s commandment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38593" data-verses="John 13:34">John 13:34</span>). Actually, their love is a matter of natural affection and has nothing to do with the Lord’s commandment. </p>
<p data-content-id="TofT8HtRPh84NluTshenNJ4K5klVo9GX-6GWVXNVjM-AbkkrSnjYFGJ4XZJr1H9Yt"> Nothing damages the church life, the Lord’s ministry, and the Lord’s work more than ambition and natural affection. Ambition for leadership is leaven, and leaven brings in corruption. Natural affection is honey, and honey brings in rottenness. <span class="pg" data-page-id="116" id="116">[116]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="nRN-9RpWzYzdXhr-0W84uWhXVzv6wXUyMyOADopoPOVCtb3FQHmSh9OGRIQ_-D705"> Ambition and affection are closely related. Suppose a brother has a particular ambition. If his ambition is fulfilled, he will be happy. If it is not fulfilled, he will be unhappy. He will love anyone who helps him to gain what he desires. But anyone who hinders him in fulfilling his ambition will be regarded as an enemy. </p>
<p data-content-id="67dOgBo1e70S3A3lNxA9Fxx5J41uH2q9yYLlBn7LhMEcWP1VC14MaUjBJJcP9KtDT"> If we want to serve the Lord for a long period of time, we must look to the Lord to purify us from ambition and natural affection. No matter how well certain saints may treat us, and no matter how close we are or how long we have been together, we should not make friends in the church life. Rather, we should regard all the saints in the same way—as brothers and sisters in the Lord. We should not be ambitious, and we should not have natural affection, for such affection will bring in rottenness. </p>
<p data-content-id="R36y4VgO7wqhNpNxDLl0OIeD3l1y2MnHC79X_ufmE0Wna47bAcYxxGOhmnV68pR00"> The meal offering must have neither leaven nor honey. We should take Christ as fine flour without adding leaven or honey. We need to ask the Lord to purify us so that in our living there will be no leaven and no honey. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sA3DT0shgAyQDQA-p8ePSMONdDAnDm6lmg0vdxCAVblltDJck0V84lLYhSpuxHAEb">XI. WITH SALT</h2><p data-content-id="wC5_UtyIRPyB7WpxJOJXBMKKEb92GCN8AU3cnMbGoPMp8MiDs1CTFLNSZcpsTXlfK"> “Every offering of your meal offering you shall season with salt; you shall not let the salt of the covenant of your God be lacking from your meal offering; with all your offerings you shall offer salt” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38594" data-verses="Leviticus 2:13">v. 13</span>). The salt here is not common; it is the salt of the covenant of God, the covenant which is incorruptible and unchangeable. This salt seasons, kills germs, and preserves. </p>
<p data-content-id="LN8LqFsPX2mirpNVn3_Fl_NwPEwtTzowX3QYUfdcNcHOHUZ6TUtCG5uztkJS3CHT0"> What is the spiritual significance of the salt in the meal offering? Thus far, in the meal offering we have seen the Spirit (the oil), Christ’s resurrection (the frankincense), and Christ’s humanity (the fine flour), but we have not yet seen the death of Christ. The death of Christ, the cross, is signified by the salt. The salt in the meal offering therefore refers to the death of Christ, to the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="mqLFmiP5_8OCpZzE87Nge8sAhJOFfmqJWkZYIFBzM8DlynnVp33_qIBdunbYlLH9U"> The reason there is so much ambition and natural affection in the church is that there is too little salt. We are short of the cross of Christ, short of the application of Christ’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="117" id="117">[117]</span> death. If we have adequate salt in the church, ambition and natural affection will be crossed out. As long as the cross is here, salt is here; and as long as salt is here, the germs will die. As long as the cross is here, ambition and natural affection will be crossed out. I hope that this will be the experience of us all. We should not have ambition, and we should not have natural affection. We should have only the crossing out of the Lord’s death. Then we will have pure humility and pure love. We will be pure, and we will live a life like that of the Lord Jesus when He was on earth, a life without leaven and honey but full of salt. </p>

The cakes of fine flour signify Christ’s humanity to be food for God and His serving ones. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fv8eruG2C4An5ussdVnkAb4Qw9j1cBFRCDYUBaT7z4c3XGWu7IZmTcTRA2UgLmbJe"> Whereas fine flour has no form, the cakes of fine flour are solid and have a definite form. These cakes indicate a stronger experience of Christ. We may experience Christ as fine flour, as meal without a form. We may also experience Christ as the cakes, as something solid and with a definite form. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="CmWO4n8XWbzptjiYJJrutWL5LtwePtdWPFMX_iz9FQow2HICWW0e_sbr39oUdQ53H">A.

Thus, the cakes signify the biggest portion of Christ in our experience of Him. From this we see that the experience of the meal offering differs in degree. You may have a portion of a certain size, and another saint may have a portion of a different size. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="-PeHukwbm9F9hxNjtJPlj6vs--HJGXPXqV79a6e9f-uRqp0PM1xtx1OvvtRGpg6pH">B.

This perforating, this piercing, signifies a kind of Christ’s suffering in His humanity. In the Lord’s human life there were <span class="pg" data-page-id="118" id="118">[118]</span> many different kinds of sufferings, and the cakes’ being perforated, or pierced, signifies one kind of Christ’s sufferings. </p>

Being mingled with oil signifies being mingled with the Holy Spirit. Christ’s humanity was always mingled with His divinity. In our experience and enjoyment today, the meal offering cannot be separated from God the Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="f1SdNSV-jnmqSNmLFj2KduK-GlcTBoF0g5vVSa13IQ9kvvIAb-D_3fsbMnQfG6L1R">XIII.

He is available to all ages. Praise the Lord that He is so edible! </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="k1b_-LdFaDzH5eTjPaqBvcmLpKHQjaDHUrgPD1q4xSXGU2fRRcrs_GWJkW-01a5uN">B.

The Holy Spirit was poured upon Him after His water baptism (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38600" data-verses="Matthew 3:16">Matt. 3:16</span>).

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38607" data-verses="Hebrews 10:7-9">Hebrews 10:7-9</span>, Christ came in the flesh to do the will of God, which was to replace the Old Testament offerings with Himself. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38608" data-verses="Hebrews 10:9">Verse 9b</span> says, “He takes away the first that He may establish the second.” The “first” denotes the animal sacrifices of the Old Testament, and the “second” denotes Christ as the unique sacrifice, the unique offering.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38609" data-verses="Hebrews 10:1">chapter ten</span> we see that this One has become the replacement of all the Old Testament offerings.

Eventually, Christ passed through death and entered into resurrection. Furthermore, as a man He ascended to the third heaven where, as a processed God-man, He is sitting on the throne. In His incarnation He brought God to earth, and in His ascension He brought man to the heavens. </p>
<p data-content-id="yM17TXa3OJ3JFUKUJNaJ-Z-EAZGYq-2qoV1tbp_R_HyvijpCtI2f4lXHS5dhDfOiX"> According to the book of Hebrews, Christ, the ascended God-man, is our High Priest. In the Old Testament, the duty of the high priest was to offer something to God, either a sacrifice or a gift, not only to make propitiation but also to please God. As sinners with a sinful nature and sinful deeds, we had a problem with God, and God had a problem with us. There was no peace between us and God. Something had to be done to appease the situation between us and God. Christ has appeased this situation by making propitiation for us. Moreover, Christ has done something to make God happy. God wanted to be happy with us, but our sins made Him unhappy with us. Before we were saved, God loved us, but He was not happy with us. Therefore, Christ offered Himself not only as a sacrifice for sin but also as a gift to please God and thereby make Him happy. As the unique offering, Christ has made propitiation for us, and He has made God happy. </p>

Paul was the first one to open up, to expound, this book. Throughout the centuries, Bible teachers, especially among the Brethren, have expounded Leviticus. The Brethren opened up the types. We today have received much help from the Bible teachers who preceded us, and we are standing on their shoulders. </p>
<p data-content-id="rCeQBKNuXLnpxNKjpL-6rcvmVmEO9HB5ztp7_KErmZE1m7T-GugDdoJ0xk-AO9IMP"> All those who have the proper understanding of Leviticus see the connection between this book and the book of Hebrews. For over sixty years we have been studying Hebrews and how it is linked to Leviticus. </p>
<p data-content-id="dUhqhQwKWbXKSbqvLKXmrZOXq6OXO9A-m0V4pRJtqQPpDGovAqJWJcKK1hwOATnaE"> In his Bible Correspondence Course, C. I. Scofield said that in every chapter of Leviticus we can see Christ. When <span class="pg" data-page-id="125" id="125">[125]</span> I first heard this, I did not understand it. I could see the offerings in Leviticus, but I could not see Christ. Eventually, I was helped by the Brethren to see that in Leviticus Christ is portrayed in the types. All the offerings are types, pictures, of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="QrptJJxnlubdylPzgsOm36qoE-PH2LPyv1OlLurgtE73Y3Ur-McK8L5I1R7Ma9Rtr"> Although I was helped by the Brethren to see Christ in the types, I did not realize until some time later that the offerings are God’s food (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38612" data-verses="Leviticus 3:11">Lev. 3:11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38613" data-verses="Leviticus 3:16">16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38614" data-verses="Leviticus 21:6">21:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38615" data-verses="Leviticus 21:8">8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38616" data-verses="Numbers 28:2">Num. 28:2</span>). Do you realize that God is hungry, that He needs food, that He needs to eat? To say that God is hungry and needs food is not according to our natural, human concept. When we speak of the offerings as sacrifices, our only thought may be that we have a problem with God and need the offerings for propitiation that our situation with God may be appeased. We may never have realized that, in reality, one of the main purposes of the offerings is that they are food for God and also for His serving ones. </p>
<p data-content-id="Kbr2zMFu7prMv589VrFoje5OP-W_abKZ7yQ9bjy8JdXHTAd4mjuWZo9eiEivMyu1q"> In the books of Exodus and Leviticus we see that the priests, who served in and around the tabernacle, ate the priestly food. What was this priestly food? It was the different kinds of offerings, both of the animal life and of the vegetable life. The offerings are not only for propitiating our situation and not only for pleasing God and making Him happy. The offerings are also for satisfying God and for satisfying, strengthening, and energizing God’s serving ones. </p>
<p data-content-id="lo2rhE_cgAMwRI2ZJVIpYWq71pSXl6e5Meoawkyfbmb_iVgZMNNND2h_d1VBdUhRD"> We may talk much about serving God, but with what should we serve Him? We need to serve God with Christ as food. This food should not be merely of one form or course; rather, like a Chinese feast, it should be of many courses. Each of the offerings is a different course. The burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the trespass offering, the sin offering, the wave offering, the heave offering, the free will offering, the drink offering—all these offerings are Christ as different courses with which we may serve God. </p>
<p data-content-id="OETCsjMBdqbNfrPdG1o4GALHJHA4NO7bMBYHie8kfs2o1Fr5FqXL4WjAzs30TDaPr"> Christ is God’s food, and He is also our food. Since Christ is our food, we need to eat Him. Some Christians, however, <span class="pg" data-page-id="126" id="126">[126]</span> may be bothered when they hear us speak about eating Jesus. We would remind them of the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38617" data-verses="John 6:57">John 6:57</span>. “As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me.” As our food, Christ strengthens us and energizes us. </p>
<p data-content-id="4mdq3y0cOc3Dr86Vjcerq3esoY40PYlfe9OOpxJJ8hAcXLR1eihN1Srq4IoiphC0s"> We serve God with Christ as our food. Apart from Christ we have nothing to offer to God, nothing with which to please and satisfy Him. Therefore, we should not come to God empty-handed but with hands full of Christ to present to God. The top portion of Christ as the offerings is God’s food for His enjoyment, and the remainder is our food for our enjoyment. From this we see that both God and His serving ones are satisfied with Christ and by Christ as food. </p>

In a sense, Leviticus is also a gospel revealing Christ. Christ is surely revealed in Leviticus, but He is revealed here in a “language” different from that used in the Gospels. We may say that this is a “Leviticus language.” One example of this language is the Hebrew word translated “burnt offering” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38618" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">chapter one</span>. Literally, this word denotes something that is ascending. If we know the language of Leviticus, we will realize that this ascending refers to Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="G8WifseOG75eXksZ0Xg3wn7MdetID8YfLcO9OTK3bDlF2oEvqaaac2VQzRzH11-xg"> In the book of Leviticus we can see many of the details related to the enjoyment of Christ. In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus revealed that He is the bread of life, that He is the bread which came down from heaven and is good for our eating (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38619" data-verses="John 6:48">6:48</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38620" data-verses="John 6:50-51">50-51</span>). But although the Lord said this clearly in John, the details concerning this cannot be found in John. For the details concerning eating Christ, we need to come to Leviticus. </p>
<p data-content-id="cEGQRZcEFdiSW_luPEGi_zuHi8CHenBiAywbXPclmSQESewfF2_kdR7dnAPblMLTy"> It is crucial that we find a way to experience and enjoy Christ as He is revealed in Leviticus. We need to experience and enjoy Him daily and practically. If we would do this, we need to know the reality of all the offerings. <span class="pg" data-page-id="127" id="127">[127]</span> </p>

This, of course, is correct. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38621" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> the Lord Jesus even tells us that He is the reality. “I am the way, and the reality, and the life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38622" data-verses="John 14:6">v. 6</span>). Elsewhere in the same chapter He speaks of the Spirit of reality (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38623" data-verses="John 14:17">v. 17</span>). Christ cannot be the reality to us if He is simply the reality itself. In Himself He is the reality, but He is not yet the reality to us. In order for Christ to be the reality to us, there is the need of the Spirit of reality. </p>

It is difficult for us to say which of these five offerings is the main offering. Some may say that the peace offering is the main offering because, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38651" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">chapters one through five</span> of Leviticus, it stands in the center. Others may say that the main offering is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="132" id="132">[132]</span> burnt offering, which signifies Christ as the One who is absolute for God. Still others may say that, since we have the problems of sin and sins in our daily life, either the sin offering or the trespass offering is the main offering. Although we need all the basic offerings, the main offering with respect to the experience of Christ in its many aspects and details is the meal offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="LN8LqFsPX2mirpNVn3_Fl_NwJEwtbzowX3QYUfdcNcHOHUZ6TUtCG5uztkJS3CHT0"> In understanding the book of Leviticus, we today are standing on the shoulders of many Bible teachers, especially those among the Brethren, who have gone before us. We surely must give credit to them. Nevertheless, because we are on their shoulders, we can see things which they have not seen. One of these things is the matter of enjoying the offerings in order to be constituted to become a certain kind of person. We become what we eat. If we eat Christ as the meal offering, we will be constituted with Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="mqLFmiP5_8OCpZzE87Nge8sAnJOFXmqJWkZYIFBzM8DlynnVp33_qIBdunbYlLH9U"> We need to know the elements that compose the meal offering.

The oil may be mingled with the flour, or it may be poured on the flour. The flour may also be anointed with the oil. The most important way of adding the oil to the flour is mingling the flour with the oil. The fine flour does not remain dry but is “oiled” both inwardly and outwardly. <span class="pg" data-page-id="133" id="133">[133]</span> </p>

Leaven signifies sin and other negative things.

<p data-content-id="f1SdNSV-jnmqSNmLFj2KduK-AlcXDoF0g5vVSa13IQ9kvvIAb-D_3fsbMnQfG6L1R"> Honey signifies the natural human life. It signifies our natural life, not in its bad aspect but in its good aspect. We should not think that people are always bad, for sometimes they are very good. But this natural goodness is honey. Hatred is leaven, but natural love is honey. Likewise, pride is leaven, but natural humility is honey. </p>
<p data-content-id="IcDSKk0-zyd2G7hWO-1B3c8-4IzrhjtjBspMyxBYA_3Aefgwi8mVa14ggFd5zUntv"> Honey seems to be different from leaven. However, after a period of time honey can ferment, and this fermentation will issue in leaven. This indicates that whether we are good or bad, the result will eventually be the same. This is the reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38657" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> speaks of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. We may be either good or bad, but in either case the result will be leaven. </p>
<p data-content-id="HomP821jsfmQ8p43kMxD4q8uW34vqTThflkEC69_mme9_M6bdRalURihY94i1Wws0"> We may use divorce as an illustration of the fermentation of honey. With a marriage that ends in divorce, a certain kind of honey—natural love—has fermented and issued in leaven. From this illustration we see that the issue of both hatred, which is leaven, and natural love, which is honey, is the same. The negative things are leaven, and the good <span class="pg" data-page-id="134" id="134">[134]</span> aspects of the natural life signified by honey eventually ferment and become leaven. </p>
<p data-content-id="XgZNVEXVlLg7OJdTmWIsMv5QyE3ooo8X5u0Ynp1K0k7DMJm_eLaooWZ29TKHlzJPK"> The life Christ lived on earth was a life without leaven and without honey, and we should live the same kind of life today. We need to have the four positive elements—fine flour, oil, frankincense, and salt—but not the two negative elements—leaven and honey. If this is our situation, we will be a proper meal offering, an offering composed of humanity oiled with divinity in resurrection through Christ’s death and without leaven and honey. This kind of life is food to satisfy God and also to nourish us as God’s serving ones. </p>

From the time of conception, that is, from the very beginning of His manhood, His humanity was wrapped up with the Holy Spirit. Apart from the Holy Spirit, Jesus could not have been conceived and born. The Lord’s conception and birth were altogether of the Holy Spirit. His humanity was mingled with the Holy Spirit. Christ’s human living was based on this mingling. </p>

The fact that the Holy Spirit descended in the form of a dove, which is known for its gentleness, indicates that the Spirit of God is a person and not merely a power, channel, or instrument. The Holy Spirit as a person came upon the Lord Jesus. This means that just as oil was poured upon the fine flour, the Holy Spirit was poured upon the Lord Jesus. On the one <span class="pg" data-page-id="135" id="135">[135]</span> hand, in His humanity He was mingled with the Holy Spirit; on the other hand, the Holy Spirit was poured upon Him and anointed Him. </p>

He thus behaved and worked in the Spirit. Everything He did in His ministry was done in the Spirit—in the essential Spirit and also in the economical Spirit. He is a man mingled with the Spirit and with the Spirit poured upon Him. </p>

<p data-content-id="G8WifseOG75eXksZ0Xg3wn7MfetVI8YfLcO9OTK3bDlF2oEvqaaac2VQzRzH11-xg"> The book of 1 Corinthians shows us a particular kind of church life. Since the church life revealed here has so many aspects, it is difficult for us to summarize this church life in a phrase or a clause or even a sentence. If we are enlightened concerning the meal offering, which describes the life of the Lord Jesus on earth, we will be able to see that the church life described in 1 Corinthians corresponds to the life of the Lord Jesus. This life was the formation of the meal offering, and the church life presented in 1 Corinthians may be called the meal-offering church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="cEGQRZcEFdiSW_luPEGi_zuHg8CWWnBiAywbXPclmSQESewfF2_kdR7dnAPblMLTy"> We have seen that the meal offering contains four elements: fine flour, oil, frankincense, and salt. The fine flour signifies Christ’s fine humanity, the oil signifies the Spirit of God, the frankincense signifies the fragrance of Christ’s resurrection, and the salt signifies the cross of Christ, which, in a subjective way, deals with all the negative things in our life. </p>
<p data-content-id="YDsRD7ifPw-lp8lc5xue-repwPbVGOgMuQ4KkOc2H7hurUt1fU4NGccyn3CnOpDOB"> We have also seen that the meal offering does not have either leaven or honey. Leaven signifies sin and all the negative things. Honey signifies the natural life in its good aspects, including natural affection. </p>
<p data-content-id="Eo8_f6xczFEz8Dhy4DUKmRXBpdtKIuIMuEdkcPMoX47E1B39u_MgRBsuwxjcPeLGZ"> If we read the four Gospels, we will see that the four elements of the meal offering were the components of Christ’s life on earth and caused Him to be the real meal offering. As Christians, we should live the same kind of life the Lord Jesus lived. This means that, strictly speaking, the Christian life should be a meal offering. <span class="pg" data-page-id="144" id="144">[144]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="DAXcbsbzMAWBUrvVTy0dqdzGR2IVQ5ymf8MzGShj-RTqJixX3OkvHHtouXshNnro9">A LIFE WITH THE HIGHEST HUMANITY</h2><p data-content-id="4mdq3y0cOc3Dr86Vjcerq3esqY40HYlfe9OOpxJJ8hAcXLR1eihN1Srq4IoiphC0s"> In order for our Christian life to be a meal offering, it must be a life with the highest humanity. This is the reason Paul charged the Corinthians, saying, “Be a man” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38728" data-verses="1Corinthians 16:13">1 Cor. 16:13</span>). According to the context of 1 Corinthians, to be a man means that we should have a high, uplifted humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="o5HGAna4E3UbMG7NGiSbaPltUm3RuYoLI3dKIr2iVbybx3hEM_7DGG6BX7Kk3dEPS"> If we have such a humanity, we will exercise self-control. This is indicated by Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38729" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:26-27">9:26 and 27</span>. “I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so I box, not as beating the air; but I buffet my body and lead it as a slave.” These verses reveal that Paul had a high humanity and that he had a strong, excellent character. He did not run uncertainly or beat the air but exercised control over himself. He was a real man with a high standard of morality in his human living. </p>
<p data-content-id="3lBTmaq9moHRumeUlLI0z9-xYbb9IhxeMZAEbbLWdHR7eQxL9TMP84tRESuFndxAt"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38730" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:4-7">First Corinthians 13:4-7</span> is a description of love. This description actually shows us a fine humanity. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38731" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:4">Verse 4</span> says, “Love suffers long, and is kind; love is not jealous; love does not brag, is not puffed up.” In our weak humanity, we have only limited patience, but love suffers long. Also, it is easy for us to be jealous and covetous, but love is not jealous. Furthermore, love does not behave unbecomingly, does not seek its own things, is not provoked, does not take account of evil, and does not rejoice over unrighteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38732" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:5-6">vv. 5-6a</span>). On the contrary, love rejoices with the truth, covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38733" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:6-7">vv. 6b-7</span>). Here we have a description of a fine humanity and of a high human character. This indicates that 1 Corinthians is a book concerned with the uplifting of humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="G8WifseOG75eXksZ0Xg3wn7MfetEB8YfLcO9OTK3bDlF2oEvqaaac2VQzRzH11-xg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38734" data-verses="1Corinthians 16:13">16:13</span> Paul does not say, “Be a hero”; he says, “Be a man.” From every angle and from every side, we should be a man. From the angle of ethics, we should be a man. From the angle of self-control, we should be a man. From the angles of wisdom and love, we should be a man. This is to have an uplifted humanity. In the book of 1 Corinthians, we can see the genuine fine flour. This book surely presents the meal-offering church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="cEGQRZcEFdiSW_luPEGi_zuHg8CLYnBiAywbXPclmSQESewfF2_kdR7dnAPblMLTy"> In the meal-offering church life, the first item is a fine, uplifted humanity. If we would have the proper church life, <span class="pg" data-page-id="145" id="145">[145]</span> we all need to have a strong character. This strong character, however, should be balanced, for an unbalanced humanity is a biased humanity. Therefore, we should be strong and also soft. If in the church life we are strong without also being soft, we will offend others. Although we need to be soft as well as strong, we should not be too soft. Those who are too soft are like noodles. There is a proverb which says that we can lift up bamboo but we cannot lift up a noodle. We cannot have a proper church life if the saints are either too strong or too soft. We need to be balanced. For the church life, we need to be a man with a fine, balanced, uplifted humanity. </p>

Such a Christ has been given to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="Slkwfbwd8WAXYyyQY7UU1Nscyw2jbLyLwR1_r8BaVpq62ItkpbBUwNo3LENsEhxaS"> Christ is God’s present, God’s gift, to us.

First Corinthians has a great deal to say about the Spirit. Paul speaks of the Spirit of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38741" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:1">chapters two</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38742" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">three</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38743" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:4">2:4</span> he says that his speech and <span class="pg" data-page-id="146" id="146">[146]</span> preaching were “in demonstration of the Spirit,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38744" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:12">verse 12</span> he tells us that we have received “the Spirit which is from God, that we may know the things which have been freely given to us by God.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38745" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:16">3:16</span> he goes on to say, “Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you?” Many Christians do not realize that they are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in them. Do you know that in your daily life there is One who indwells you? Do you realize that the Spirit of God takes you as His dwelling place? The Spirit has been given to us, and now He dwells in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="5c5lLvOTxKbegnfVCkujIZCQyiZ2P8xQJy4GzCHBtPSGykqXudXnQpZPgRpmmqveb"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38746" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">6:17</span> Paul says, “He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.” This indicates the mingling of the Lord as the Spirit with our spirit. Since we are one spirit with the Lord, we are part of Him. This does not mean that we are part of God as an object of worship; it means that we are a part of the Lord in our life experience. In our spirit we are one with the divine Spirit. We have been oiled with the Spirit, and we have even been joined to the Spirit. Not only have we received the Holy Spirit—we are one with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="N1UwjLbqomFsD8Hs1MzRwX7s3_DqzgZu-SP6P-yYnxUULR5dEvstQRid9lxUvJo_Y"> If we were not one with the Spirit, we could not have the church life.

<p data-content-id="tq7hKR37puDvUqPzDeSKSsL-lC_-BUnOB1sQ10OAzaUm598D1pDdUeNiY98sV6D5J"> The word in Leviticus concerning the offerings was spoken by the Lord in a little tent, the tent of meeting. In the wilderness, apart from millions of people who were busy doing many things, the very God who created the universe came into a small tent. Whatever the Triune God spoke there was for eternity. Through God’s wonderful speaking, that little tent of meeting will gradually issue in the New Jerusalem. Every aspect of this speaking concerning Christ and our enjoyment of Christ in togetherness with God will be fulfilled in the New Jerusalem. There in the New Jerusalem we will surely realize that Christ is our burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, sin offering, trespass offering, wave offering, and heave offering. All these offerings will eventually issue in the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="huE1la_VvhqT-E_rMeCC-1o7BtV2bjHXdPzx2sbNshy0olh7DO3UOWL5zObECuN3-"> In Leviticus the offerings are in a particular sequence. First we have the burnt offering and then the meal offering and then the peace offering. The burnt offering signifies that we must be absolutely for God, and the meal offering indicates that Christ is our daily food. When we are absolutely for God and live by feeding on Christ, the result is peace. We have peace with God and with one another. This means that when Christ satisfies us, He becomes the peace between us and God. Today we are in this peace, which is Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Uy7vFEnwR55XavTnTo3EqFJW4pHpKdfDirVdCYDVpVTdtZKnpVBJGlLm1pEB8cOAx"> Christ is the One by whom and through whom we are absolutely to God and for God. Christ is also the One on <span class="pg" data-page-id="154" id="154">[154]</span> whom we are feeding every day. He is our daily food. This Christ is now the peace we enjoy with God and with one another. Therefore, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering are the basic offerings for us to enjoy Christ as our peace with God and with one another. This is the significance of the sequence of these three offerings. </p>
<p data-content-id="MPOCDFUKm8cVcjpGd7ROS35m_3MvWGrsW0PImFA2Wzbc3DwzZLz1gDLcK7CSHAOA3"> When we get out of Christ, we have no peace. If we are short of peace, we are short of Christ. The amount of peace we have depends on how much of Christ we have. Having peace is a measurement to show us to what degree we enjoy Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="V7B55sygWuttI4KoZ4bOSqhsxH85ec2BybMHU3NWuBbXmv0xQiUlyWnEa-JNV4Dll"> There is no reason for the church people not to have peace. We should not try to have peace by our own effort. The more we try in ourselves to have peace, the less peace we will have. The only way to have peace is to enjoy Christ every day. In the morning we should take Christ as our burnt offering and offer Him to satisfy God. Then we should take Him as our daily food to meet that day’s particular need. </p>
<p data-content-id="pOQyt1gjzS1vZpd150kJXgoaToVtZeJdrM5O10orBdv0cPWAhLe2gIJMOqxTtjK6d"> We should enjoy Christ today and forget about yesterday and about tomorrow. Yesterday is gone, and we are not in tomorrow. Since yesterday is gone, none of us can remain in it. Whether we were a failure or a success yesterday, yesterday is passed. As Christians we do not have tomorrow; we only have today. Do not bother about tomorrow—live today! What do we have today? We have Christ. Christ is today. </p>

After the father received the prodigal, the fatted calf was slain for their enjoyment. This fatted calf is an illustration of Christ as our peace offering for our enjoyment with our receiving God.

<p data-content-id="IcDSKk0-zyd2G7hWO-1B3c8-6IznjjtjBspMyxBYA_3Aefgwi8mVa14ggFd5zUntv"> The peace offering is based upon God’s satisfaction in the burnt offering. The peace offering which God and we enjoy today is based upon Christ’s being the burnt offering. This is indicated by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38773" data-verses="Leviticus 3:5">Leviticus 3:5</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38774" data-verses="Leviticus 6:12">6:12</span>. Speaking of the peace offering, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38775" data-verses="Leviticus 3:5">3:5</span> says, “Aaron’s sons shall offer it up in smoke on the altar upon the burnt offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire; it is an offering by fire of a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.” Here we see that the burnt offering is a base for the peace offering to be received by God. With the burning of the burnt offering as the basis, God receives the peace offering. </p>

On the one hand, the peace offering is based on the burnt offering; on the other hand, the peace offering is an issue of the enjoyment of the meal offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="k1b_-LdFaDzH5eTjPaqBvcmLtKHYvaDHUrgPD1q4xSXGU2fRRcrs_GWJkW-01a5uN"> This is not a matter of doctrine but of experience. If we would enjoy Christ as peace in a practical, daily way, we must first take Him as our burnt offering to satisfy God. Then we must feed on Him as the meal offering, enjoying Him as our food. Immediately Christ will become our peace offering. I believe that we all have experienced this. <span class="pg" data-page-id="156" id="156">[156]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="JYgdOTAphL2MixIdDMe3gVg_hZqhPUwH83TVGMXXC5x0rPf1TViep-9RX2Pq_QKeG"> Although we have experienced Christ as the offerings, we may not have had the knowledge of the pictures in Leviticus. In presenting these pictures, Leviticus uses a number of technical terms. Many of us have experienced Christ without knowing these technical terms. One of these terms is <em>burnt offering.</em> In the morning, we may pray, “Father God, I love Your Son, and I would like to offer Him to You.” We enjoy Christ so sweetly and present this Christ to God to make Him happy. This is to present Christ to God as the burnt offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="zLs19c8l0fJmVCIlaXT2eNrKx7Rk2xx4r18qhLGRHCQGX8rX56yBc-Lf9eVsYHyhn"> After presenting Christ to God as the burnt offering, we may say, “O Lord, You are my daily supply. Without You I cannot live.” This is taking Christ as the meal offering, as the life supply. <em>Meal offering</em> is the technical term for <em>life supply.</em> </p>
<p data-content-id="abOlojkYEV6S5Nyw1iDNLhoZThZkVxNgoVyybWxTCvwbL9IKdQKnhKWGzjO26wOAP"> When we take Christ as the burnt offering and as the meal offering, we have peace. We have the sense that something within us is joyful and that we are right with God and acceptable to Him. Earlier you might have had a problem and thus were not at peace with God, but now there is no problem, and you are at peace. This is the enjoyment of Christ as the peace offering. We all may have this experience and enjoyment every day. </p>

Sometimes we enjoy a large Christ. At other times something happens, perhaps some disturbance in our family life, that limits our enjoyment of Christ. This does not mean that Christ has become smaller; <span class="pg" data-page-id="157" id="157">[157]</span> it means that the condition in which we enjoy Christ has become narrow and small. Satan seeks to limit our enjoyment of Christ and to narrow the condition in which we are enjoying Christ. Therefore, we must learn to overcome all kinds of situations, even praying in our “private room” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38777" data-verses="Matthew 6:6">Matt. 6:6</span>) in order to avoid interruptions, so that we may be in a better and higher condition to enjoy a larger Christ. </p>

This sequence is not according to human thought, which would put the sin offering first. We know that we are sinful, and, as the first thing, we want our sin to be dealt with. After this, we might take the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering. The divine sequence is different from this. The divine sequence opens with the burnt offering, showing us that the primary thing with us should be that we are absolute for God. The burnt offering is followed by the meal offering, which shows us that we should take Christ as our life supply and live by Him daily. As the issue of taking Christ as the burnt offering and the meal offering, we have peace. Although we have peace, we still have certain problems—sin within and sins without—and these surely need to be dealt with. </p>

Sin refers to the indwelling sin, which came through Adam into mankind from Satan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38821" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Rom. 5:12</span>). It is dealt with in the second section of Romans, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38822" data-verses="Romans 5:12">5:12 to 8:13</span> (with the exception of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38823" data-verses="Romans 7:5">7:5</span>, where <em>sins is</em> mentioned). Sins refer to the sinful deeds, the fruits of the indwelling sin, which are dealt with in the first section of Romans, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38824" data-verses="Romans 1:18">1:18 to 5:11</span>. However, the singular sin in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38825" data-verses="1John 1:7">1 John 1:7</span> with the adjective <em>all</em> does not denote the indwelling sin but every single sin we have committed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38826" data-verses="1John 1:10">v. 10</span>) after we have been regenerated. This sin defiles our purged conscience and needs to be cleansed away by the blood of the Lord Jesus in our fellowship with God. </p>

This is the sin mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38841" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Romans 5:12</span>. If we <span class="pg" data-page-id="163" id="163">[163]</span> say that, after we have been saved and regenerated, we do not have sin, we are self-deceived. Although we have been saved and regenerated and although we seek the Lord, love Him, and have fellowship with Him, we still have sin indwelling us. This is a fact.

Here “sins” denotes our sinful deeds. </p>

The burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering bring us into fellowship with God. When we take Christ as our burnt offering before God and when we take Him as our daily life supply, we are brought into divine peace, and in this peace we enjoy the Triune God in fellowship. Therefore, the issue of our experience of the first three offerings is fellowship with God, who is light. In the light we see our failures, our mistakes, and our wrong attitude toward others. Eventually we realize not only that we have outward sins but also that sin dwells in our flesh. We even realize that we ourselves are sin. We have the deep realization that we are nothing but sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="Uy7vFEnwR55XavTnTo3EqFJW3pHwHdfDirVdCYDVpVTdtZKnpVBJGlLm1pEB8cOAx"> We may try to be good and do what is right.

Through our fellowship with God, who is light, we discover that we are sinful, that we have sin inwardly and sins outwardly. Inwardly we have a sinful “mother,” and outwardly we have sinful deeds, which are the “children” of this sinful mother. </p>

These works include strife, jealousy, divisions, and parties. Can we say that we are without strife and jealousy in our church <span class="pg" data-page-id="164" id="164">[164]</span> life? We cannot say this. In the church life there may also be parties; that is, the saints may take sides with certain ones. This was the situation in Corinth. “Each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38847" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:12">1 Cor. 1:12</span>). If we have strife, jealousy, divisions, and parties in our church life or family life, we are living and acting in the flesh. If we say that we have fellowship with God and still have these works of the flesh, we are walking in darkness and we are self-deceived. If we have strife, jealousy, divisions, and parties in our church life, this means that our church life is in darkness. Likewise, if we say that we are in fellowship with God but are wrong in our attitude toward our husband or wife, we are self-deceived. </p>

If we have criticized certain brothers or taken sides with certain saints, we will realize that this also is wrong. Oh, may we all be willing to be enlightened and look to the Lord for light! If we say that we are enjoying the Lord, we must be in the light. </p>

Sin came in through Adam’s fall and entered into the human race (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38888" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Rom. 5:12</span>). Therefore, with all human beings there is something called sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="k1b_-LdFaDzH5eTjPaqBvcmLjKHYnaDHUrgPD1q4xSXGU2fRRcrs_GWJkW-01a5uN"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38889" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> sin is personified, because it can dwell in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38890" data-verses="Romans 7:17">v. 17</span>), kill us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38891" data-verses="Romans 7:11">v. 11</span>), and do many things in us. Thus, sin is a living person. We cannot find a verse which says that sin is Satan himself. However, the Bible indicates that sin is the nature of Satan. Since sin is the nature of Satan, sin is actually Satan himself. </p>

This means that Adam’s fall opened the gate for sin, which is the nature of Satan and even Satan himself, to come into <span class="pg" data-page-id="172" id="172">[172]</span> our being. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38892" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> tells us clearly that sin dwells in our flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38893" data-verses="Romans 7:17">vv. 17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38894" data-verses="Romans 7:20">20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38895" data-verses="Romans 7:23">23</span>). We have often wanted to do good, for example to honor our parents or regard our brother, yet the outcome was just the opposite. We sinned unintentionally, doing something that we had no intention of doing. Because Paul had this kind of experience, he could say, “It is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38896" data-verses="Romans 7:20">Rom. 7:20b</span>). </p>

One person does not want to sin, and the other person, who is within the first person, sins. This indicates that Paul was living a life of two persons—a life of himself, Saul of Tarsus, and a life of something that is called sin. These two persons lived together, but not willingly. Sometimes they were good friends, and sometimes they fought with each other. </p>

Have you not discovered that there is a war going on within you? On the one hand, we may say, “I love the church.” On the other hand, something within us says, “I do not like the church.” Sometimes we may say, “I love all the saints. All of them are dear and lovable.” However, there may be a certain elder whom we cannot love. There is a fighting within us. We aspire to be holy, but the outcome is not holiness. All day long we commit sins of ignorance. </p>

This is the reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38899" data-verses="Galatians 5:24">Galatians 5:24</span> says, “They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts.” </p>

The flesh is altogether one with sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38900" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Rom. 8:3</span>), and sin is altogether one with Satan. Actually, sin is Satan. Furthermore, Satan is one with the world, and the world is one with the prince of the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38901" data-verses="John 12:31">John 12:31</span>).

The word <em>prince</em> here implies authority or power. The world is actually the struggle for power. Every person and every nation are struggling for power. Everywhere there is competition, rivalry, for power. In the universities both the professors and the students are struggling for power. For example, a professor may say that he is trying to help society or that he wants to invent something to benefit society. Actually he, along with everyone else, is struggling for power. This struggle for power is the result, the issue, of the flesh, sin, Satan, the world, and the prince of the world. </p>

This indicates that even in the church life there may be the struggle for vainglory. This is proved by the fact that Paul’s word here was written to churches, to the churches of Galatia (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38904" data-verses="Galatians 1:2">Gal. 1:2</span>), which was a province of the ancient Roman Empire. We all seek vainglory. If this were not our situation, Paul would not have needed to say this word to us. We may think that the things mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38905" data-verses="Galatians 5:16-26">5:16-26</span> existed among the churches of Galatia but are not among us today. However, we should not read these verses as applying to them alone; we should include ourselves when we read such verses. Just as we apply <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38906" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span> to ourselves, so we should also apply <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38907" data-verses="Galatians 5:16-26">Galatians 5:16-26</span>. </p>

It deals not only with sin itself but also with our flesh, with Satan, the evil one in our flesh, with the world, and with the struggle for <span class="pg" data-page-id="174" id="174">[174]</span> power. According to the Bible, sin is involved with these four things. </p>

He wanted to be above God or at least to be in rivalry with Him. Therefore, when the Bible condemns sin, it condemns Satan and also the flesh, the world, and the struggle for power. Everything that is happening on earth is related to the struggle for power. All the good speeches, lectures, and explanations given by men are just cloaks to cover the struggle for power. </p>

Christ became flesh; that is, He came in the likeness of the flesh of sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38910" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>). Furthermore, God made Christ, who did not know sin, sin on our behalf on the cross (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38911" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">2 Cor. 5:21</span>). While Christ was on the cross, He was judged in the form of the serpent for our sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38912" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span>).

In the New Testament sin is a personified matter. It is not something small but is a very crucial matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="k1b_-LdFaDzH5eTjPaqBvcmHqKHBsaDHUrgPD1q4xSXGU2fRRcrs_GWJkW-01a5uN"> In this universe there are two sources. One is God, and the other is Satan, God’s enemy and adversary (the word <em>Satan</em> means adversary). Satan became God’s enemy and adversary when he entered into a struggle with God for power (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38963" data-verses="Isaiah 14:1">Isa. 14</span>). Satan also tempted the Lord Jesus with respect to power (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38964" data-verses="Luke 4:5-7">Luke 4:5-7</span>). The whole universe today is a matter of the power struggle between Satan and God. All the world follows Satan and has become a part of this evil struggle. Therefore, under the influence of Satan, all of humankind is engaged in a power struggle. For example, the employees in a certain corporation may be striving for a promotion. This is a small part of the universal power struggle, a struggle that can be found everywhere. </p>
<p data-content-id="JYgdOTAphL2MixIdDMe3gVgzmZqIFUwH83TVGMXXC5x0rPf1TViep-9RX2Pq_QKeG"> This power struggle is one of the five items whose aggregate is sin. These items are the flesh, sin, Satan, the world, and the prince of the world. The prince of the world signifies the struggle for power. Every human being, including little children, likes to be a prince, a leader, and everywhere on earth today there is a power struggle. As we will see, this power struggle is related to the sin offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="zLs19c8l0fJmVCIlaXT2eNrG27RJ9xx4r18qhLGRHCQGX8rX56yBc-Lf9eVsYHyhn"> When we repented to the Lord and received Him as our Savior, we were enlightened to see that we are evil and <span class="pg" data-page-id="180" id="180">[180]</span> under God’s condemnation. The more we love the Lord, the more we realize that we are evil. The more a believer prays, the more he feels that he is too evil. Eventually, we are brought to the realization that even today as a Christian seeking after the Lord we are nothing but a totality of sin. We are not only evil and sinful—we are the totality of sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="MPOCDFUKm8cVcjpGd7ROS35q43MKcGrsW0PImFA2Wzbc3DwzZLz1gDLcK7CSHAOA3"> If we realize that we are sinful and begin to confess our sins, we may find that the more we confess, the more there is to confess. This was my experience in 1935. One day, having the deep sense that I needed to be alone with the Lord, I went to a secluded place, kneeled down, prayed, and began to confess my sins. My confession went on for a long time. Prior to that time, I did not know how sinful I was or how many sins I had. I saw that everything I had done since my youth was sinful, and I made a thorough confession to the Lord. </p>

Enjoying Christ as the burnt offering will lead us to take Him as our life supply, as our meal offering, which is Christ in His humanity becoming our daily food. We need to enjoy Him until we feel that we have peace with God, with ourselves, and with everyone. Immediately we will be in the light, and the light will shine within us, upon us, and around us. Then we will realize that we have sinned and that we are sin. This is the experience in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="38965" data-verses="1John 1:1">1 John chapter one</span>. God is light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38966" data-verses="1John 1:5">v. 5</span>). In order to have fellowship with Him, we must walk in the light as He is in the light.

We are not absolute for God because something within us is for ourselves and not for God. This is the struggle. A sister may experience this struggle while shopping in a department store. She may want to buy a particular item, but she senses that the Lord <span class="pg" data-page-id="181" id="181">[181]</span> does not agree. She begs the Lord to give her permission to make the purchase this one time. Her begging is actually a sign of a struggle between her and the Lord. Satan is hidden within such a struggle. </p>

However, only we ourselves know how much we are in a struggle with God day after day. God wants us to be absolute for Him, but we may be willing to be absolute for Him only to a certain degree. We may criticize others for not being absolute for God, but how much are we absolute for Him? Instead of being utterly absolute for God, we engage in a power struggle with Him. </p>

Many Christians do not realize that there is such a thing as the law of sin. Do you know what the law of sin is? The law of sin is simply the spontaneous power, strength, and energy to struggle with God. Something within us is living and active; it is crouching in our inner being, watching over us. Whenever we have even a little thought of being for God, something within us rises up to take us over. This is the law of sin. In his experience, Paul found out not only that sin dwelt in his flesh, but also that within him there was a natural power, strength, and energy to resist whenever he desired to be for God. This made him a wretched man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="38971" data-verses="Romans 7:24">Rom. 7:24</span>). This is the law of sin as the deeper meaning of sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="nRN-9RpWzYzdXhr-0W84uWhbWzv60XUyMyOADopoPOVCtb3FQHmSh9OGRIQ_-D705"> We have often been defeated by this thing that is crouching within us.

All of the Ten Commandments deal with outward matters except the commandment not to covet. This commandment touches the greed within us. Paul did not want to be greedy, but he could not help it. When he tried to obey this commandment, something within him rose up and wrought in him “coveting of every kind.” Paul was thus a victim of the law of sin. </p>

Sin is a matter of indwelling sin as the nature of Satan within us. Sins are a matter of outward sinful deeds. The sin offering deals with sin, and the trespass offering deals with sins, transgressions, and trespasses, including lies, mistakes, and all kinds of wrongdoing. Trespasses are transgressions, and transgressions are different kinds of sins. </p>

<p data-content-id="_WsCu0UVGd8o3Q6ZANIAJepRnWd9K7Zx5OwRVVx1PunU7kpT6WA8gEA6LgK96lE05"> The phrase “likeness of the flesh of sin” combines sin and the flesh. Our flesh today is the flesh of sin. As we have pointed out, sin and the flesh are related to Satan, the world, and the prince of the world. Whereas our flesh is the flesh of sin, Christ came only in the <em>likeness</em> of the flesh of sin. In Him there was no sin; He did not have sin in His human nature. Nevertheless, in appearance He bore the likeness of the flesh of sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="BbO8eSfTx5R84H_f9kv8JKRZmG3Twcqg7Rva48wPNAlxcvoNCVQHbME6iRkopNA5y"> The flesh of fallen mankind is the flesh of sin. In other words, the flesh of the fallen human race is one with sin. Where the flesh is, there is sin. The word <em>flesh</em> signifies a fallen person, and every fallen person is sin. Whether we love others or hate them, we are sin. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39000" data-verses="Genesis 6:3">Genesis 6:3</span> says that fallen man became flesh.

When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He was sin in the eyes of God. Christ was crucified in His flesh. This means that His flesh was crucified. Since His flesh was crucified, sin was condemned because sin and the flesh are identical. God judged the flesh, and He judged sin. He did this by judging Jesus on the cross. When God judged Jesus, He judged the flesh and sin. Moreover, at that time God destroyed Satan in the flesh, judged the world that was hanging on Satan, and condemned the prince of the world and the power struggle. One was crucified, but five things were dealt with: sin, the flesh, Satan, the world, and the power struggle. These five things are one. </p>

If Jesus had not been made sin, sin could not have been judged when He was crucified. Sin was condemned because Christ, while He was on the cross, was made sin on our behalf by God. </p>

As the marginal notes in the American Standard Version indicate, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39004" data-verses="Isaiah 53:10">Isaiah 53:10</span> puts the trespass offering together with the sin offering.

This signifies that the trespass offering for our outward sins, for which even a little fine flour is <span class="pg" data-page-id="192" id="192">[192]</span> sufficient, is lighter than the sin offering, which needs a bull, or at least a lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39011" data-verses="Leviticus 4:4">4:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39012" data-verses="Leviticus 4:32">32</span>). </p>

This signifies that a trespass is out of the inward sin and out of not living for God. The inward sin needs the sin offering. Not living for God needs the burnt offering. The two are a complete type of Christ as the trespass offering resolving our sins. </p>

From where does a trespass come? What is its source? The source of every trespass is the sin that is in our flesh. What is the reason for a trespass? The reason is our not living for God. Therefore, concerning trespasses we have a source with a reason. </p>
<p data-content-id="G8WifseOG75eXksZ0Xg3wn7AYetIH8YfLcO9OTK3bDlF2oEvqaaac2VQzRzH11-xg"> We may say that the inward sin is like a man, a husband, and that not living for God is like a woman, a wife. The marriage of these two produces a child, and the name of the child is trespass. </p>

In this illustration the inward sin is the fruit tree, not loving God and not living for Him make up the atmosphere and environment in which the tree grows, and trespasses and transgressions are the fruit. </p>

<p data-content-id="4mdq3y0cOc3Dr86Vjcerq3eguY4pNYlfe9OOpxJJ8hAcXLR1eihN1Srq4IoiphC0s"> The word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39031" data-verses="Leviticus 5:1">Leviticus 5</span> was spoken not to an individual saint but to God’s congregation, to God’s people as an assembly. This word was not given to help and instruct an individual saint. Rather, this word was given for the purpose of keeping God’s chosen people, as a body, proper, holy, and separated to Him. Furthermore, what is spoken here should not be applied to secular, human society. God does not have the intention to make the entire human society a congregation like the children of Israel in ancient times. God’s intention in Leviticus was to keep His chosen people clean and holy that He might dwell among them. The tabernacle was in the midst of the people, and God wanted the people, who were around the tabernacle, to be holy. This was the reason the word in Leviticus was given. </p>
<p data-content-id="o5HGAna4E3UbMG7NGiSbaPlhQm3IlYoLI3dKIr2iVbybx3hEM_7DGG6BX7Kk3dEPS"> Let us now consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39032" data-verses="Leviticus 5:1">chapter five</span> of Leviticus verse by verse. </p>
<p data-content-id="3lBTmaq9moHRumeUlLI0z9-9cbbYAhxeMZAEbbLWdHR7eQxL9TMP84tRESuFndxAt"> In typology, every aspect of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39033" data-verses="Leviticus 5:1">Leviticus 5</span> has a spiritual significance. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39034" data-verses="Leviticus 5:1">Verse 1</span> says, “When a person sins in that he hears a public charge to testify, and he is a witness, either he has seen or known the matter, and he does not declare it, then he shall bear his iniquity.” This verse actually deals with lying. A lie involves Satan, for he is the father of lies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39035" data-verses="John 8:44">John 8:44</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="G8WifseOG75eXksZ0Xg3wn7AbetlI8YfLcO9OTK3bDlF2oEvqaaac2VQzRzH11-xg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39036" data-verses="Leviticus 5:2">Leviticus 5:2</span> says, “When a person touches any unclean thing, whether the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of an unclean creeping <span class="pg" data-page-id="198" id="198">[198]</span> thing, and it is hidden from him and he is unclean, then he is guilty.” This verse speaks of the carcasses of beasts, cattle, and creeping things. The beasts are wild animals, and the cattle are domesticated animals. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39037" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">chapter eleven</span>, the animals in this verse typify different kinds of people. Some people are like beasts, others are like cattle, and still others are like creeping things. The word <em>carcass</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39038" data-verses="Leviticus 5:2">5:2</span> signifies death. The carcasses of these three kinds of animals—the carcass of beasts, the carcass of cattle, and the carcass of creeping things—thus signify three kinds of death. One kind of death is wild like a wild beast. A second kind of death is mild like a gentle, domesticated animal. A third kind of death is subtle like a creeping thing. In typology this indicates that among God’s people there may be three kinds of death: wild death, mild death, and subtle death. </p>
<p data-content-id="67dOgBo1e70S3A3lNxA9Fxx1I41uD2q9yYLlBn7LhMEcWP1VC14MaUjBJJcP9KtDT"> Among God’s people, that is, in the church life, there may not only be death; there may be different kinds of death. Death may spread among us in a wild way, in a mild way, or in a subtle way. During my years in the church life, I have seen these three kinds of death. I have seen the kind of death that is wild and the kind of death that is mild and gentle. I have also seen the kind of death that creeps in in a subtle, cunning way. Have you not experienced some kind of death in the church life? Perhaps you have experienced the kind of death that is typified by the carcass of a creeping thing, the death that comes in to spread its poison secretly and subtly. </p>
<p data-content-id="R36y4VgO7wqhNpNxDLl0OIeP2l1yyMnHC79X_ufmE0Wna47bAcYxxGOhmnV68pR00"> Regardless of its kind, death is death, and it is unclean. Every kind of death—wild, mild, and subtle—is filthy and defiling. It is not easy in the church life to stay away from the uncleanness of these different kinds of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="sA3DT0shgAyQDQA-p8ePSMOBcDAnHm6lmg0vdxCAVblltDJck0V84lLYhSpuxHAEb"> According to the typology in the Old Testament, sin is not as dirty as death. If one sinned, he could be forgiven and cleansed immediately by offering a trespass offering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39039" data-verses="Leviticus 5:10">5:10</span>). But if one touched death, he had to wait a few days to become clean. From this we can see that death is more defiling than sin. However, we in the church life may think that <span class="pg" data-page-id="199" id="199">[199]</span> sin is serious but that touching death is common and not serious. But in the eyes of God to touch death is the most serious thing. </p>
<p data-content-id="wC5_UtyIRPyB7WpxJOJXBMKGFb92CCN8AU3cnMbGoPMp8MiDs1CTFLNSZcpsTXlfK"> The poison of death can damage and destroy the saints. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39040" data-verses="Romans 14:1">Romans 14</span> Paul says that we should not destroy the work of God by doing things carelessly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39041" data-verses="Romans 14:15">vv. 15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39042" data-verses="Romans 14:20">20</span>). Christ has redeemed and saved the saints, and we should not destroy them by acting carelessly. The Lord has done a lot of gracious, redemptive work on the saints in the Lord’s recovery, and for years we have been working to build up the saints. No one should destroy the gracious work of Christ on the saints. No one should destroy those on whom we have been working for their building up. Would not our hearts be hurt to see the saints destroyed by the poison of death? We need to be sober, fair, calm, and kind to consider whether we are really building up the Body of Christ or unconsciously doing something to destroy God’s work by spreading the poison of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="LN8LqFsPX2mirpNVn3_Fl_N8OEwtfzowX3QYUfdcNcHOHUZ6TUtCG5uztkJS3CHT0"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39043" data-verses="Leviticus 5:3">Leviticus 5:3</span> says, “When he touches the uncleanness of man, whatever his uncleanness is whereby he is unclean, and it is hidden from him, when he knows it, then he is guilty.” The “uncleanness of man” here signifies the uncleanness of man’s natural life. The Lord Jesus said that nothing that goes into us defiles us; rather, what comes out of us defiles us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39044" data-verses="Matthew 15:17-20">Matt. 15:17-20</span>). The natural life, like death, brings in uncleanness. In the church life, in the holy community, death and the natural life may be prevailing. </p>
<p data-content-id="mqLFmiP5_8OCpZzE87Nge8sMgJOFTmqJWkZYIFBzM8DlynnVp33_qIBdunbYlLH9U"> The natural life includes the matter of natural affection. Either we do not care for one another or we love one another in a natural way, in the way of natural affection. Someone may have had an affection for you in the past, but today he does not care for you at all. This is not according to our Christian nature to love, help, and take care of others. It is altogether in the natural realm. We may love others or, seeking vain glory and being jealous of others, we may envy them. This love and this envy are both of the natural life. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZFdhXfV0GtQ7ozQy5uEoF65n26rkIlqjdVAMW6C4PfTWSUVAOgHKQM3Y0B8x6f0De"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39045" data-verses="Leviticus 5:4">Leviticus 5:4</span> continues, “Or when a person utters an oath, speaking rashly with his lips to do evil or to do good, in <span class="pg" data-page-id="200" id="200">[200]</span> whatever a man may speak rashly with an oath, and it is hidden from him, when he knows it, then he is guilty in any of these.” Here we have the matter of speaking rashly, of speaking something before God in a hasty, careless, and reckless way. We may hear about a certain thing and immediately say that we like it or do not like it and that we will do this or that concerning it. To speak in such a way indicates not merely that we do not live for God but that we do not even fear God. Who are we to say rashly that we do not like a certain thing? God may like it. We are not God, and we need to be careful about speaking hastily. Instead of expressing our opinion about a matter, we should say nothing and, if necessary, bring the matter to the Lord, praying and asking Him to show us whether we should have a share in it or stay away from it. This is the right attitude of a person who fears God. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX99LAoSSDDp0sZ8GP9dslC6iGo8sDOOXlVaDXIcuoHkKGg7wn__7mL30AgWcce-r"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39046" data-verses="Leviticus 5:1-4">5:1-4</span> we have four items as illustrations of things which need the trespass offering. If we were to make a list of such things, we would not list the four items mentioned here: not witnessing what we know (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39047" data-verses="Leviticus 5:1">v. 1</span>), touching the carcass of an animal (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39048" data-verses="Leviticus 5:2">v. 2</span>), touching the uncleanness of man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39049" data-verses="Leviticus 5:3">v. 3</span>), and speaking rashly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39050" data-verses="Leviticus 5:4">v. 4</span>). God speaks of these items, for He knows the real situation and need of His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fv8eruG2C4An5ussdVnkAb4cx9j5WBFRCDYUBaT7z4c3XGWu7IZmTcTRA2UgLmbJe"> The first item, not witnessing what we know, is actually a matter of lying. As we have pointed out, this involves Satan, the father of lies. Therefore, Satan is alluded to here. </p>
<p data-content-id="CmWO4n8XWbzptjiYJJrutWL1KtwSFtdWPFMX_iz9FQow2HICWW0e_sbr39oUdQ53H"> The second item is death in three forms—wild, mild, and subtle. Death is the most hateful thing in the eyes of God. Death is spread in a wild way, in a gentle way, and in a subtle way. This is the real situation among God’s congregation in this age. </p>
<p data-content-id="PuyO3Sd3rtHDCrlUqHprqNkeqrIM9ZNKJnWiDhMvDB-DvcclyKQkDsf8ThJYtKq9k"> The third item is the natural life with its uncleanness. It is very common for Christians to walk and act in the natural life. Is the natural life not prevailing in today’s church life? Those who are sociable in a natural way are often well received, but those who walk in the spirit are often misunderstood. A great deal of the natural life can be seen among Christians and in God’s congregation today. <span class="pg" data-page-id="201" id="201">[201]</span> </p>

This is something that worldly people cannot understand, for they are raised and educated to become something in the world. Worldly parents certainly do not teach their children to offer themselves to God to be burned. </p>
<p data-content-id="tq7hKR37puDvUqPzDeSKSsLyhC_OBUnOB1sQ10OAzaUm598D1pDdUeNiY98sV6D5J"> By the Lord’s mercy and grace, our heart is different from the heart of the unbelievers. We know that the burnt offering indicates that we have a heart that is absolute for God in this age. We are not for anything else, and we have no other interest. Even though we encourage the young people to get the best education, education is not the thing we love. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="208" id="208">[208]</span> young people may get the highest education, but they need to realize that on this earth we Christians will eventually be nothing but ashes. This will be the issue of our offering ourselves to God as a burnt offering and of our being burned. </p>
<p data-content-id="QrptJJxnlubdylPzgsOm36qkD-PHyLPyv1OlLurgtE73Y3Ur-McK8L5I1R7Ma9Rtr"> I would like to say a word to the young people who have the heart to serve the Lord full-time. I must tell you that hardships await you and that there is no future for you on earth. You will have nothing earthly on which to rely for your security and for your human living. You may feel that you will be very useful to God, but in the end you will be ashes. Everyone wants to be somebody, but if you would serve the Lord Jesus full-time, you must prepare yourself to be nobody, even to be ashes. Are you willing to be burned? To be burned to ashes is a matter not of enjoyment but of suffering. The destiny of a full-timer is a life of suffering. What is offered to God as a burnt offering must be on the place of burning, not on the place of anything glorious or high. Eventually, the outcome of such a life, a life of suffering, a life without a future and without security, will be a heap of ashes. </p>
<p data-content-id="Kbr2zMFu7prMv589VrFoje5CI-W_ebKZ7yQ9bjy8JdXHTAd4mjuWZo9eiEivMyu1q"> Although we have no earthly security, I can testify that we have the Lord Jesus as our security. Christ is my security, even though He sometimes hides Himself from me in order to test me. As a result of my experience and learning, I can tell you that the best time to enjoy the Lord Jesus is when He is hiding from you. After seeming to disappear for a while, He will spontaneously appear to us again. This is often His way with us. Such a Christ is our real security. </p>

The age we are in is a dark night. The burnt offering <span class="pg" data-page-id="209" id="209">[209]</span> should be burning continually through the whole night until the morning. </p>

The real sun rising will be the Lord’s coming back, and we are waiting for this. However, we should not expect the Lord Jesus to come back quickly to spare us from the trial of the dark night. The more we ask Him to come quickly for this reason, the more He may delay His coming for our sake and for the sake of our passing through a longer dark night. </p>
<p data-content-id="o5HGAna4E3UbMG7NGiSbaPlhRm3RqYoLI3dKIr2iVbybx3hEM_7DGG6BX7Kk3dEPS"> Recently I spoke a word to the full-timers in Taipei concerning sufferings and hardships.

This signifies the need of the serving one’s cooperation with God’s desire. This cooperation is to add more fuel to the holy fire to strengthen the burning for the receiving of the burnt offering as God’s food. As we are being burned, we need to add more wood to burn ourselves and also to burn our fellow serving ones. Do not quench the fire but add more wood to keep the fire burning. </p>

Linen is fine, pure, and clean. The priest’s putting on his linen garment and linen breeches thus signifies that fineness, purity, and cleanness are needed in handling the ashes (the result) of the burnt offering. We should not think of the ashes as waste that can be handled in a careless manner. On the contrary, the ashes are the result of the burnt offering, and in handling this result we need to be proper. We need to be fine, pure, and clean. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="huE1la_VvhqT-E_rMeCC-1o3FtVnZjHXdPzx2sbNshy0olh7DO3UOWL5zObECuN3-">V.

This signifies the stateliness in handling the ashes (the result) of the burnt offering. In God’s eyes, the result of our burnt offering is highly regarded. It is fine, pure, and clean. Thus, in carrying the ashes outside the camp, the priest wore stately garments and carried the ashes in a stately way. This teaches us to have a high regard for the result of our burnt offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="MPOCDFUKm8cVcjpGd7ROS35q73MCcGrsW0PImFA2Wzbc3DwzZLz1gDLcK7CSHAOA3"> To become a full-timer is to offer ourselves to God as a burnt offering. Concerning this, there should be and must be a result. We should regard this result and not despise it or consider it insignificant. The result of our being a burnt offering will be something that carries out God’s New Testament economy. What we do as full-timers is not merely to preach the gospel to save sinners, to establish local churches, to teach the Bible, or to help people to grow in life and in truth. What we do must result in the building up of the Body of Christ, which is a miniature of the coming New Jerusalem. </p>

The meal offering being offered in front of the altar signifies that the meal offering is offered in relation to the redemption of Christ on the cross. The altar is a type of the cross. In the Old Testament there is the altar, but in the New Testament there is the cross. “In front of the altar” therefore means in relation to the redemption of Christ on the cross.

We <span class="pg" data-page-id="217" id="217">[217]</span> became priests by our regeneration. Having been regenerated, we should now live a life as God’s priests, serving God. You may serve God as a priest even though you have a full-time job. We may be engaged in different kinds of proper employment, but we can still do our work in the sense of being priests to God. For example, a brother who is a physician may carry out his medical practice as a priestly service, preaching the gospel to unbelievers to bring them to Christ and ministering life to believers. If we all behaved as priests in this way, serving God in His gospel, in His mercy, in His grace, and in His life, this would be the best way to preach the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugJdCXLu0ey6qT0teoiBGH7UDsymQqFo8Xz3Iczpu7TrQaSjH1QUlKlNLKEP00tlJ"> However, the actual situation among believers is the opposite. More than half of the people in the United States may be Christians, but it is rare to hear of anyone preaching the gospel in their place of employment. Many believers live like worldlings, like common people, not like priests. What a shame! Since we are priests, we need to ask ourselves about our gospel preaching. </p>

This is what Paul did; his preaching of the gospel was a priestly service (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39085" data-verses="Romans 15:16">Rom. 15:16</span>). In his priestly service he offered the Gentiles to God. Do we have some saved sinners whom we can offer to God? </p>
<p data-content-id="IcDSKk0-zyd2G7hWO-1B3c8y5IzrljtjBspMyxBYA_3Aefgwi8mVa14ggFd5zUntv"> The book of Leviticus is altogether concerned with the priests. Nearly every chapter concerns the life, living, need, and supply of the priests and all the other things related to them. If we are not priests in actuality, we are not qualified to enter into this book. Therefore, I am deeply burdened to beg you to come back to your heavenly calling as priests of God. The first duty of our priestly service must be to bring sinners to present to God as offerings. </p>
<p data-content-id="HomP821jsfmQ8p43kMxD4q8iX34vuTThflkEC69_mme9_M6bdRalURihY94i1Wws0"> Paul said that he was saved to be an example to all the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39086" data-verses="1Timothy 1:16">1 Tim. 1:16</span>). He was the believers’ pattern, and his first duty was to gain sinners and offer them to God as offerings. His work of preaching was the real New Testament priestly service. Surely Paul knew what it meant to have <span class="pg" data-page-id="218" id="218">[218]</span> Christ as his meal offering for his priestly service. But the meal offering may not be as real to us as it was to Paul, because only to a small degree is our life actually the life of a priest. How sad it would be if we only talked about the priestly service but were not actually in it! </p>
<p data-content-id="XgZNVEXVlLg7OJdTmWIsMv5czE3oso8X5u0Ynp1K0k7DMJm_eLaooWZ29TKHlzJPK"> In these days while I am considering the book of Leviticus, my heart is weeping. The more I read and study this book, the more my heart is weeping. Among us there is little that would cause us to be joyful. We are talking about the priestly food, but who are the priests, and where are they? In this message I am burdened to stress this one point—the book of Leviticus is for the priests. </p>
<p data-content-id="k1b_-LdFaDzH5eTjPaqBvcmHuKHUlaDHUrgPD1q4xSXGU2fRRcrs_GWJkW-01a5uN"> Regarding the priestly service, we need to consider our situation and ask ourselves where we are. The prophet Haggai charged the people of Israel to consider their ways (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39087" data-verses="Haggai 1:5-11">Hag. 1:5-11</span>). We all need to reconsider our way. What kind of believers are we? Are we priestly believers or common believers? </p>

<p data-content-id="ZFdhXfV0GtQ7ozQy5uEoF65nx6r5ElqjdVAMW6C4PfTWSUVAOgHKQM3Y0B8x6f0De"> It is not difficult for us to consider as law the Ten Commandments given through Moses. However, we may find it hard to regard as a law something that concerns the enjoyment of Christ. We may think that if there is a law concerning the enjoyment of Christ, there will not be any enjoyment. Nevertheless, each of the five offerings has its own law. Therefore, the sin offering has its law, and with this law there are a number of regulations. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX99LAoSSDDp0sZ8GP9dslC6lGolhDOOXlVaDXIcuoHkKGg7wn__7mL30AgWcce-r"> As descendants of Adam we have a fallen life, a lawless life unwilling to be ruled, governed, or controlled by anyone. Our Adamic life is rebellious, and our Adamic nature is lawless. But when we were saved and regenerated, we received another life—the divine life, the life of God—and this life is the opposite of our fallen, lawless life. This means that as genuine believers in Christ, we have two lives, an old one and a new one. The first is the natural, human life, and the second is the divine life, the eternal life. It is not too much to say that the divine life is God Himself; it is God within us to be our life. Whereas the fallen, natural life is lawless, the divine life within us is absolutely according to law and regulation. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fv8eruG2C4An5ussdVnkAb4c29jcUBFRCDYUBaT7z4c3XGWu7IZmTcTRA2UgLmbJe"> Every kind of life has its own law. For example, a bird flies according to the law of the bird life, and a peach tree bears peaches according to the law of the peach tree life. The divine life also has its own law. </p>
<p data-content-id="CmWO4n8XWbzptjiYJJrutWL1NtwzGtdWPFMX_iz9FQow2HICWW0e_sbr39oUdQ53H"> The law of the sin offering is according to the law of what we have enjoyed of Christ. In our enjoyment of Christ as the burnt offering, we need to realize that Christ is a life and <span class="pg" data-page-id="224" id="224">[224]</span> this life has a law. The law of the burnt offering, therefore, is written according to the law of the Christ whom we have enjoyed. The principle is the same with the other offerings. The peace offering and the meal offering are a living person, Christ. As a living person, Christ has a life with a law. Thus, the law of the peace offering and the law of the meal offering correspond to the life law of Christ. Apparently, the written law concerns only the peace offering and the meal offering. Actually, in our experience, the law of the peace offering and the law of the meal offering become a living law, a law of the very life of the Christ whom we enjoy. </p>
<p data-content-id="cEGQRZcEFdiSW_luPEGi_zuLj8CLcnBiAywbXPclmSQESewfF2_kdR7dnAPblMLTy"> Every law in letters is written according to a certain life. If we were to write a law concerning elderly people, that law would have to correspond to the life of elderly people. The same would be true with a law written concerning young people. This principle applies to the law given to us by God. God has given us a law that we should worship Him because we have a worshipping life. God would never give such a law to animals, because they do not have such a life. </p>
<p data-content-id="YDsRD7ifPw-lp8lc5xue-relzPbMNOgMuQ4KkOc2H7hurUt1fU4NGccyn3CnOpDOB"> Three portions in the New Testament indicate that even in the enjoyment of Christ we need to be regulated. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39100" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:26-27">1 Corinthians 9:26 and 27</span> Paul says, “I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so I box, not as beating the air; but I buffet my body and lead it as a slave, lest having preached to others, I myself should become disapproved.” Literally, the Greek word translated “buffet” means to beat the face under the eye black and blue. This is not to ill-treat the body as in asceticism, nor to consider the body evil as in Gnosticism. This is to subdue the body and make it a conquered captive to serve us as a slave for fulfilling our holy purpose. In these verses we see not only requirements but demands. Here we have the strongest demand of the strongest law. </p>

And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39102" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">verse 15</span> Paul tells us that “neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.” This is grace. Today we do not need circumcision or uncircumcision—we only need grace. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39103" data-verses="Galatians 6:16">verse 16</span> Paul <span class="pg" data-page-id="225" id="225">[225]</span> goes on to tell us that the way to receive mercy and peace is to “walk by this rule,” the rule of the new creation. God has saved us to the state and condition of a new creation with Christ as its life. Now we need to walk by the rule of this new creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="DAXcbsbzMAWBUrvVTy0dqdzKS2I0Z5ymf8MzGShj-RTqJixX3OkvHHtouXshNnro9"> The rule of the new creation will regulate us in the time we go to bed at night and rise in the morning. On the Lord’s Day in particular, the rule of the new creation will urge us to rise up a little earlier, pray for the meeting, and come to the meeting early to meet with the Lord and worship Him. </p>

Only this, whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us walk.” The Greek word translated “walk” here means to walk orderly; it is derived from a word which means to range in regular line, to march in military rank, to keep step, to conform to virtue and piety. Thus, Paul is here charging us to walk in line, in order, and in a regulated way. </p>
<p data-content-id="N1UwjLbqomFsD8Hs1MzRwX7g0_Dm5gZu-SP6P-yYnxUULR5dEvstQRid9lxUvJo_Y"> These three portions of the New Testament all indicate the same thing—that in the enjoyment of grace we need to be ruled. <span class="pg" data-page-id="226" id="226">[226]</span> </p>

This signifies two things. First, it signifies that Christ as our sin offering was slain before God. Second, it signifies that Christ was offered to God as our sin offering based upon His being the burnt offering to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Uy7vFEnwR55XavTnTo3EqFJa6pH8BdfDirVdCYDVpVTdtZKnpVBJGlLm1pEB8cOAx"> We may think that if we bring an offering to God, we may slaughter it anywhere. However, here God requires His people to slaughter the sin offering before Him in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered. The offering must be presented according to God’s regulations. From this we see that even though we today are enjoying Christ as grace, there are still regulations that we must follow in the enjoyment of Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="2RckI5Ct4Iw0lfg0o-7qXnscdetbFcK0dqFXHy3GZc1Qzj85J-8LmfOv-1xMzMlJ0"> In my study of biographies and history, I have received much help from the living and practices of two persons, George Müller and Hudson Taylor. George Müller, a leading one among the British Brethren, rose up every morning to walk in the open air and to read the Bible and pray as he walked. As he read, he prayed. He testified that from this practice he received the best nourishment, edification, knowledge, and building up in his Christian life. The practice of Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission, was very similar. He also rose up in the morning to spend time with the Lord in the Word, and he testified of the nourishment he received. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugJdCXLu0ey6qT0teoiBGH7UBsy7SqFo8Xz3Iczpu7TrQaSjH1QUlKlNLKEP00tlJ"> I mention the practice of George Müller and Hudson Taylor because I am concerned for the Christian life of the young ones. In the Christian life, spiritual birth is only the beginning. If a human being is to be raised properly and to grow adequately in every phase of life, he must be raised in a good home and attend school from kindergarten through high school. This is the law according to the physical life. The principle is the same in the Christian life. We need a spiritual home where we can grow and a spiritual school where we can receive a proper education. In addition, we need to behave ourselves, cooperating with both the home and the school. This is the law according to the spiritual life. </p>
<p data-content-id="f1SdNSV-jnmqSNmLFj2KduKyDlcCKoF0g5vVSa13IQ9kvvIAb-D_3fsbMnQfG6L1R"> When we were regenerated, we received another life—the divine life, the life of God—which is different from our natural life. Whether our natural life is good or bad, we need to forget that life and go along with the second life, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="232" id="232">[232]</span> divine life. In this second life there is a law that corresponds to the five laws in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39118" data-verses="Leviticus 6:1-2">Leviticus 6 and 7</span> concerning the enjoyment of Christ in five aspects. Today, we need to go along strictly with this second life. If we do this, we will receive much spiritual benefit. </p>
<p data-content-id="IcDSKk0-zyd2G7hWO-1B3c8y7IzCvjtjBspMyxBYA_3Aefgwi8mVa14ggFd5zUntv"> Every life has its own law and its own sense. The divine life, therefore, has a law and also a sense. To us today, this life is not objective but is altogether subjective. The divine life is in us. This life within us is subjective to such an extent that often we find it difficult to distinguish our original, natural life from our second, divine life. Nevertheless, it is a fact that the divine life is within us, and this life has a particular sense. </p>
<p data-content-id="HomP821jsfmQ8p43kMxD4q8iV34ClTThflkEC69_mme9_M6bdRalURihY94i1Wws0"> Some illustrations will help you understand what I mean by the sense of the divine life within us. Before you were saved, you may have enjoyed a certain kind of worldly entertainment. When you wanted to participate in that kind of entertainment, you simply did so. But after being saved and regenerated, quite often you would have a sense or feeling within that would not agree with your participating in that worldly amusement. You may then have felt that it was better to use the time to pray, and something within you—the sense of the divine life—would agree. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugJdCXLu0ey6qT0teoiBGH7UBsymYqFo8Xz3Iczpu7TrQaSjH1QUlKlNLKEP00tlJ"> Sometimes the inner sense may not agree with your intention to spend a certain available time in prayer. After further consideration, you may have the desire to visit your cousin to preach the gospel, and the inner sense may agree. Praying and preaching the gospel are both good and holy things; however, the inner sense may agree with the latter and not with the former. Thus, you do not have the peace to stay home and pray, but you do have the peace to preach the gospel. Such an experience tells you that now you have something which you did not have before you were saved—the divine life with its law and its sense or feeling. If you take care of this inner sense, the sense of the divine life, you will keep the law of this life. </p>
<p data-content-id="f1SdNSV-jnmqSNmLFj2KduKyDlcbBoF0g5vVSa13IQ9kvvIAb-D_3fsbMnQfG6L1R"> I would like to help you to make a decision, to make up your mind, to live and walk according to the law of the new <span class="pg" data-page-id="233" id="233">[233]</span> life. You need to decide not to live any longer according to the old way. You are not what you were before you were saved. You are a new creation, a regenerated person, a member of the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="IcDSKk0-zyd2G7hWO-1B3c8y7IznnjtjBspMyxBYA_3Aefgwi8mVa14ggFd5zUntv"> Immediately after their regeneration, some believers have not only the desire and the aspiration but even the ambition to be new, holy, heavenly persons. But perhaps some of you have not yet made such a decision. I am concerned that you will continue to live, act, and behave in the old way. Therefore, I would urge you, even beg you, to make a decision that you will not be as you were in the past. </p>
<p data-content-id="HomP821jsfmQ8p43kMxD4q8iV34jsTThflkEC69_mme9_M6bdRalURihY94i1Wws0"> Because we are regenerated persons, we should be different in everything from what we were in the past. We were generated through our parents to receive the natural, human life, but we were regenerated by God to receive the divine life and thereby to become God’s children. Now we need to live like children of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="XgZNVEXVlLg7OJdTmWIsMv5cxE3kqo8X5u0Ynp1K0k7DMJm_eLaooWZ29TKHlzJPK"> If you were adopted by the president, surely you would decide spontaneously to live and act like a child of the president. We need to realize that we are children of the Lord of the whole universe, the One who is much higher than the president. Since we are children of such a God, we should behave as His children. </p>
<p data-content-id="k1b_-LdFaDzH5eTjPaqBvcmHsKHYjaDHUrgPD1q4xSXGU2fRRcrs_GWJkW-01a5uN"> Although we are the children of God, we may come to the meetings of the church in either a proper or an improper way. Some may come to the meeting on the Lord’s Day sloppily dressed. They may also come late and take a seat according to their preference. Of course, the meeting is full of grace, and some grace may rain on them, but it is questionable how much grace they will receive and how much they will treasure it. Others may come to the meeting on the Lord’s Day properly washed and dressed, and prepared not only in their spirit but also in their whole being. They may even come early, take an appropriate seat, and pray for the meeting. Surely they will receive more grace, and they will treasure what they receive. They will receive spiritual benefit, and they will in turn be a benefit to the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="JYgdOTAphL2MixIdDMe3gVgzgZqtJUwH83TVGMXXC5x0rPf1TViep-9RX2Pq_QKeG"> We need all kinds of regulations in our Christian life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="234" id="234">[234]</span> Some may feel that this is too legal, but here in the type we do have the laws, the regulations, for the enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="zLs19c8l0fJmVCIlaXT2eNrGw7Rowxx4r18qhLGRHCQGX8rX56yBc-Lf9eVsYHyhn"> Let us now consider the various aspects of the law of the trespass offering. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="abOlojkYEV6S5Nyw1iDNLhoVShZofxNgoVyybWxTCvwbL9IKdQKnhKWGzjO26wOAP">I. THE TRESPASS OFFERING BEING MOST HOLY</h2><p data-content-id="bMciakEq1jnYyMA9zOc4fi_yFFB670kBRXyiszf2beiMhuuovJ4PBc3b8Pwvp8oTA"> “This is the law of the trespass offering; it is most holy” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39119" data-verses="Leviticus 7:1">Lev. 7:1</span>). Like the meal offering and the sin offering, the trespass offering is most holy. This signifies that Christ as our trespass offering is most holy in dealing with the sins in our conduct. </p>
<p data-content-id="qrtD4k7nSUxKl3L1F9HYvF1GynTDaWZnHU9tH7v7LVX2V0M-w6m_gV8s2EafX305n"> When we apply Christ as our trespass offering, we must do this in a holy way. We should never apply this offering in a loose or careless way, much less in a sinful way. Concerning the trespass offering, we need to remember that God uses this offering to refer us to the sin offering, reminding us that sin is in our flesh and that sin includes Satan, who is the father of lies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39120" data-verses="John 8:44">John 8:44</span>), the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39121" data-verses="1John 5:19">1 John 5:19</span>), and the power struggle. The trespass offering also refers us to the burnt offering, reminding us that we commit sins because we are not fully and wholly for God. The reason we lose our temper or strive with certain saints is that we are not wholly for God. Since the trespass offering refers us to the sin offering and the burnt offering, we should not take the trespass offering in a light way. Actually, nearly the entire Christian life is involved with the trespass offering. Therefore, we should have the proper realization of this offering and apply it according to its law. </p>

This signifies that Christ as our trespass offering in dealing with the sins in our conduct is based upon His being the burnt offering to God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="235" id="235">[235]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="bMciakEq1jnYyMA9zOc4fi_yEFBr40kBRXyiszf2beiMhuuovJ4PBc3b8Pwvp8oTA"> The law of the peace offering is a long law concerning the enjoyment of Christ. No Christian would ever imagine that the enjoyment of Christ would be so regulated. Both the Old Testament and the New Testament have warnings concerning the improper, or lawless, enjoyment of Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39131" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:17">First Corinthians 11:17</span> says that we could meet together not for the better but for the worse. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39132" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:27">Verse 27</span> says, “Whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39133" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:29">Verse 29</span> speaks of the one who “eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the body.” Here we see that the word in the New Testament is more solemn than that in the Old Testament. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yM17TXa3OJ3JFUKUJNaJ-Z-IDZGgq-2qoV1tbp_R_HyvijpCtI2f4lXHS5dhDfOiX">I. THE PEACE OFFERING<br/>FOR THANKSGIVING BEING OFFERED<br/>WITH THE MEAL OFFERING OF UNLEAVENED CAKES MINGLED WITH OIL, UNLEAVENED WAFERS<br/>ANOINTED WITH OIL, AND CAKES<br/>OF FINE FLOUR SATURATED, MINGLED WITH OIL</h2><p data-content-id="8CNj27OFWN_6qC9vAuBiiMupLbk0UYeypGMeEZeM8id7MXFWLRMGZ4VnbbcHB5Ro8"> The first kind of peace offering is the peace offering for thanksgiving. Of all the different peace offerings, this one is the weakest. Concerning this kind of peace offering, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39134" data-verses="Leviticus 7:12">Leviticus 7:12</span> says, “If he offers it for thanksgiving, then with the thanksgiving sacrifice he shall offer unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes of fine flour saturated, mingled with oil.” This signifies that Christ, whether mingled with the Spirit <span class="pg" data-page-id="240" id="240">[240]</span> without sin, or anointed with the Spirit without sin, or as the fine One saturated with the Spirit, as the meal offering in our enjoyment of Him in His conduct, is our peace offering, crucified with the shedding of His blood on the cross (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39135" data-verses="Colossians 1:20">Col. 1:20</span>), in our thanksgiving to God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0Mc2AjIjEcgnOIfYqSBXyGYfhnctsEwKUmlwVwYbl9P2sUtxfBsUTcI2aw4ETTmDP">II.

This signifies that the offerer, though enjoying Christ as the One without sin, still has sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="tq7hKR37puDvUqPzDeSKSsLylC_vKUnOB1sQ10OAzaUm598D1pDdUeNiY98sV6D5J"> The reason the peace offering for thanksgiving is the weakest kind of peace offering is that it includes leaven. This indicates that the offerer still has sin and is therefore in a weak condition. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="huE1la_VvhqT-E_rMeCC-1o3BtVrTjHXdPzx2sbNshy0olh7DO3UOWL5zObECuN3-">III. FROM THE MEAL OFFERING<br/>THE OFFERER OFFERING ONE PIECE FROM EACH OFFERING AS A HEAVE OFFERING TO JEHOVAH,<br/>AND IT BEING FOR THE PRIEST<br/>WHO OFFERS THE PEACE OFFERING</h2><p data-content-id="Uy7vFEnwR55XavTnTo3EqFJa4pHwDdfDirVdCYDVpVTdtZKnpVBJGlLm1pEB8cOAx"> “And from it he shall offer one from each offering as a heave offering to Jehovah; it shall be for the priest who dashes the blood of the peace offering” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39137" data-verses="Leviticus 7:14">v. 14</span>). This has a twofold significance. First, since the heave offering is a type of Christ in His ascension, this signifies that Christ as the meal offering in all His aspects is offered to God as the One in ascension. Second, this signifies that such a Christ is partaken of and enjoyed as food by the one who ministers Christ as the peace offering. When we minister the ascended Christ to others, we partake of the very Christ whom we minister. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MPOCDFUKm8cVcjpGd7ROS35q_3MKYGrsW0PImFA2Wzbc3DwzZLz1gDLcK7CSHAOA3">IV.

This signifies that the maintaining power of this kind of offering is rather small, that it has to be fully enjoyed on the offering day, and that our experience and enjoyment of Christ in this aspect should be fresh daily. </p>
<p data-content-id="ivxFinYAwLQi2teoWLAO0sXcmaEO78tRoutdjeTon_4zq6XLkUjUpOe_VDOm3Pn7t"> We may be thankful to God and offer Him a peace offering. This is an offering in which we enjoy Christ in God’s presence. However, the peace offering for thanksgiving is a weaker offering, and its enjoyment cannot be carried from one day to the next. The lasting power of this offering is not great. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="187ceXh_NbRnYyu1mrKM_o07cxjJhDgQKRD-2KHDg7OF95AMtokSZlUzK2LV54vgN">V.

This signifies that the maintaining power of the peace offering for a vow or a freewill offering is stronger than that for thanksgiving, that it should be eaten on the offering day, and that our stronger enjoyment of Christ could last longer. If our offering is stronger, our enjoyment of this offering will last longer. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="j-jDcdhlkFZU8qlJLAj5ysD4qqYhyhfT2n3xMNxM3nxLGWTONa1r1tuZp-L9a064x">VI.

It shall be an abhorrent thing, and the person who eats of it shall bear his iniquity” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39140" data-verses="Leviticus 7:18">v. 18</span>). This signifies that our enjoyment of Christ in its oldness shall not be pleasant to God and not right with Him. The lawless enjoyment of Christ is abhorrent to God. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39141" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">1 Corinthians 11</span> Paul warns us that in coming to the Lord’s table, we must be careful. <span class="pg" data-page-id="242" id="242">[242]</span> </p>

This signifies that the enjoyment of Christ as our peace should be kept from all uncleanness. </p>

This signifies that the enjoyment of Christ as our peace should not only be kept from all uncleanness but should also be eaten by a clean person. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wC5_UtyIRPyB7WpxJOJXBMKGAb96ECN8AU3cnMbGoPMp8MiDs1CTFLNSZcpsTXlfK">IX.

And when a person touches anything unclean, whether the uncleanness of man, or an unclean beast, or any unclean abomination, and then eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings that belong to Jehovah, that person shall be cut off from his people” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39144" data-verses="Leviticus 7:20-21">vv. 20-21</span>). This signifies that the unclean person who partakes of Christ as his peace, as at the Lord’s table (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39145" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:16-17">1 Cor. 10:16-17</span>), shall be put aside from the fellowship of the enjoyment of Christ (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39146" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:13">1 Cor. 5:13b</span>). An unclean person is a sinful person. Such a person should be removed from the fellowship at the Lord’s table. </p>

This signifies that in their daily living the sons of Israel should consider God’s food, as indicated by the fat <span class="pg" data-page-id="243" id="243">[243]</span> of the ox, sheep, and goat, which fat signifies the tender, fine, and excellent part of the person of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX99LAoSSDDp0sZ8GP9dslC6nGowiDOOXlVaDXIcuoHkKGg7wn__7mL30AgWcce-r"> This matter is crucial. As priests, in our eating we need to be concerned about God’s food and should not eat the fat, which is God’s portion. When we are practicing our priestly service, we are serving God, and we should consider not our own things but God’s things. The fat, the top portion of the offerings, must not be eaten by the priests but must be offered to God for His satisfaction. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Fv8eruG2C4An5ussdVnkAb4c09jxeBFRCDYUBaT7z4c3XGWu7IZmTcTRA2UgLmbJe">XI.

This signifies that the dirtiness of death spoils the significance of God’s enjoyment of Christ. God hates death and does not want to look upon anything related to it. </p>

<p data-content-id="lo2rhE_cgAMwRI2ZJVIpYWq35pSyp6e5Meoawkyfbmb_iVgZMNNND2h_d1VBdUhRD"> The word <em>consecration</em> is sometimes translated “ordination.” Consecration is on our side; we consecrate ourselves to God. Ordination is on God’s side; He ordains us. </p>
<p data-content-id="OETCsjMBdqbNfrPdG1o4GALLFHAZAO7bMBYHie8kfs2o1Fr5FqXL4WjAzs30TDaPr"> As a result of my study of Exodus and Leviticus, I am convinced that for Aaron and his sons to be consecrated to serve as priests meant that their empty hands were filled. Aaron and his sons appeared empty-handed before Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting. But when they were consecrated, their empty hands were filled with the type of Christ in different aspects. </p>
<p data-content-id="abOlojkYEV6S5Nyw1iDNLhoVchZoXxNgoVyybWxTCvwbL9IKdQKnhKWGzjO26wOAP"> The first seven chapters of Leviticus describe five categories of offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. Then five kinds of laws are given concerning the application of the five kinds of offerings. The result of the application of these offerings is peace. Peace is the totality of what Christ is to us with God. Under Christ’s redemption, we are enjoying Christ as a totality, and this totality is peace, which implies rest, enjoyment, and satisfaction. </p>
<p data-content-id="bMciakEq1jnYyMA9zOc4fi_yLFB6z0kBRXyiszf2beiMhuuovJ4PBc3b8Pwvp8oTA"> After the record of the offerings, Leviticus describes the <span class="pg" data-page-id="250" id="250">[250]</span> consecration of the priesthood. This indicates that the offerings in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39169" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">chapters one through seven</span> are for the consecration, or ordination, of the priests. </p>
<p data-content-id="qrtD4k7nSUxKl3L1F9HYvF1G8nTPYWZnHU9tH7v7LVX2V0M-w6m_gV8s2EafX305n"> According to the spiritual significance of this book, we all are priests. We have been reborn, regenerated, to be priests (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39170" data-verses="Revelation 1:6">Rev. 1:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39171" data-verses="Revelation 5:10">5:10</span>). As long as we have been regenerated, we are the real priests. However, we need a day of consecration on which we give ourselves to God and say, “Lord, I am Yours because You bought me. You redeemed me with Your blood, and You have regenerated me. Now that I have Your life and the enjoyment of Your redemption, I would like to offer myself to You. I give myself to You to serve You as Your servant, even as Your slave.” God will immediately accept our offer and ordain us to be His serving ones, His priests. Thus, consecration is on our side, and ordination is on God’s side. </p>
<p data-content-id="yM17TXa3OJ3JFUKUJNaJ-Z-IMZG5j-2qoV1tbp_R_HyvijpCtI2f4lXHS5dhDfOiX"> Leviticus is not a book for ordinary people; it is a book for priests. Since we have been sanctified and separated from ordinary people, we are no longer common. We are a particular people—we are priests. All the offerings refer to Christ, and whatever Christ is to us and does for us is to constitute us priests. This constitution is the divine ordination. </p>
<p data-content-id="8CNj27OFWN_6qC9vAuBiiMupEbkRaYeypGMeEZeM8id7MXFWLRMGZ4VnbbcHB5Ro8"> God constitutes us to be something different from what we are by our natural birth.

Regardless of their class or social status, all human beings have been constituted sinners. All are sinners by birth.

This signifies that for our consecration for the priesthood we need to be washed by the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39176" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:11">1 Cor. 6:11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="dUhqhQwKWbXKSbqvLKXmrZObm6ObM9A-m0V4pRJtqQPpDGovAqJWJcKK1hwOATnaE"> Here Moses somewhat signifies Christ, and the water typifies the Holy Spirit.

And he put the breastplate on him, and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim. And he placed the turban upon his head, and on the turban, at its front, he placed the golden plate, the holy crown.” This signifies that Christ as our High Priest is adorned with all the excellencies of His divine and human attributes and virtues. These attributes and virtues are Christ’s garment. (See Life-study Messages on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39179" data-verses="Exodus 28:1">Exodus 28</span>.) </p>

Moses’ clothing the sons of Aaron with priestly garments signifies <span class="pg" data-page-id="252" id="252">[252]</span> that the New Testament priests are adorned with all the attributes and virtues of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="4mdq3y0cOc3Dr86Vjcerq3egkY44BYlfe9OOpxJJ8hAcXLR1eihN1Srq4IoiphC0s"> The New Testament uses clothing to refer to our outward expression (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39181" data-verses="Matthew 21:7">Matt. 21:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39182" data-verses="John 13:4">John 13:4</span>). Our outward expression should be the expression of Christ’s divine attributes. These attributes include the divine love, kindness, and holiness. Christ’s divine attributes are expressed in human life as virtues. This means that the divine attributes become human virtues, and the human virtues are the expression of the divine attributes. The divine attributes and human virtues are not merely combined and united but mingled. For example, as a man Christ had human love, but this human love was mingled with the divine love. What God is (oil) was mingled with what Christ is (fine flour) in His humanity. In this way, God’s nature was included in the expression of Christ’s humanity. Because in Christ the divine attributes were mingled with the human virtues, His love, kindness, and mercy are extraordinary. In Him, the divine love, kindness, and mercy were mingled with the human love, kindness, and mercy. </p>
<p data-content-id="o5HGAna4E3UbMG7NGiSbaPlham3doYoLI3dKIr2iVbybx3hEM_7DGG6BX7Kk3dEPS"> This mingling of the divine attributes and the human virtues has become our clothing, because we who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39183" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Gal. 3:27</span>). To put on Christ is to be clothed with Christ. The very Christ with whom we are clothed is our priestly garment. Now whether we are a husband or a wife, a parent or a child, a teacher or a student, we should wear our priestly garment—a garment that is the expression of Christ’s divine attributes mingled with His human virtues. Especially when we are going out to preach the gospel to sinners, we need to wear this garment. The expression of Christ should be our uniform. As we contact others, we need to impress them with the expression of Christ, that is, with the Christ with whom we are clothed. If we do this, we will have power and authority in our gospel preaching. </p>

Sometimes the Lord’s servants will work with the Triune God to adorn the saints with Christ. I am a little servant of God co-working with Him to adorn you with Christ, to help you to change your uniform from the uniform of your natural human life, culture, and nationality to the uniform of Christ.

<p data-content-id="Eo8_f6xczFEz8Dhy4DUKmRXNmdtyIuIMuEdkcPMoX47E1B39u_MgRBsuwxjcPeLGZ"> In this message we will consider further the consecration of Aaron and his sons. </p>
<p data-content-id="DAXcbsbzMAWBUrvVTy0dqdzKe2ItQ5ymf8MzGShj-RTqJixX3OkvHHtouXshNnro9"> In the consecration of the priesthood, the first thing carried out was the anointing of the priests. This indicates strongly that the consecration or anointing of the priesthood is to make God one with us, for the anointing oil signifies that whatever God is, whatever He does, and whatever He will do are ours. What God has done, what He is doing, and what He will do involve many things, such as Christ’s incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, ascension, and coming back. All this has been anointed upon us, that is, made one with us. This is the positive side of the ordination of the priesthood. </p>
<p data-content-id="Slkwfbwd8WAXYyyQY7UU1NsQ9w2GZLyLwR1_r8BaVpq62ItkpbBUwNo3LENsEhxaS"> In the consecration of Aaron and his sons, the offerings immediately followed the anointing. The offerings remind us of who and what we are, and of what we should be yet are not. </p>
<p data-content-id="ge3wnxIwGxa4rrtSyd1Wi9Tr_Oshr5UCxwpTMeqQUEqdRe-NF0C2fsGQOIKlAT22Z"> The sin offering is the first to do such a reminding. Aaron had been anointed with the anointing oil, which signifies that the Triune God with all that He is, has done, and will do was now Aaron’s. This anointing also indicates that Aaron was one with the Triune God. However, this anointed one still needed a strong reminding that by himself and in himself he was sin, a sin-constituted sinner, and flesh with nothing good in him; that he was a natural man, a part of the old creation, which is absolutely saturated, possessed, <span class="pg" data-page-id="258" id="258">[258]</span> usurped, and indwelt by the evil one; and that he was filled with the world and the power struggle. </p>
<p data-content-id="9XfKmc-D9mR_l4j2zl61bRPLa4yHG1EyjHCSkford0o6f2fHKljszhGKeM9npgLuc"> The Triune God had ordained Aaron to be His serving one and had anointed him with Himself. However, Aaron still needed to realize what he was. Thus, God used the sin offering to remind him of what he was. On the first day of Aaron’s priesthood and every day thereafter, he had to offer the sin offering to God so that he would be reminded of what he was. </p>
<p data-content-id="j-jDcdhlkFZU8qlJLAj5ysD4kqYh6hfT2n3xMNxM3nxLGWTONa1r1tuZp-L9a064x"> We today are God’s priests. He has chosen, appointed, and ordained us to be His holy priests. Whatever the Triune God has done, is doing, and will do is ours. He is one with us, and we are one with Him. However, we still need to be reminded that, in ourselves, we are sin, flesh, and the old man, that we are the old creation, which is saturated with Satan, the evil one, and that we are filled with the world and its power struggle. If every day and all during the day the brothers, co-workers, and elders would remember this, being reminded of what they are, the situation among us would be different. </p>
<p data-content-id="TofT8HtRPh84NluTshenNJ4GzklVo9GX-6GWVXNVjM-AbkkrSnjYFGJ4XZJr1H9Yt"> Concerning our life and work, we need to ask ourselves whether the one moving, acting, and doing things is the old man or God’s priest. Do you have the assurance to say that whatever you are doing in the church life, in the Lord’s work, and in the recovery is of the divine priesthood and not of the flesh? Who can say that his hands are clean and that he is absolutely free from the flesh? Because we cannot say this, we need the sin offering as it is typified in Leviticus. We need this offering not only to be forgiven by God but also to be reminded of what we are. Even in loving others we need to be reminded that we are sin, flesh, the old man, and the old creation and that we are filled with worldliness. If we love others according to our flesh, taste, and choice, our love is sinful in the eyes of God, for such a love is linked to the evil one. Furthermore, as we pray and share in the meetings, we may have thoughts that come from the flesh, where sin is hidden and where Satan moves secretly. This is our actual situation. Thus, we need the sin offering not only at the time <span class="pg" data-page-id="259" id="259">[259]</span> of our ordination as priests but also every time we practice our priesthood. </p>
<p data-content-id="nRN-9RpWzYzdXhr-0W84uWhbfzv6wXUyMyOADopoPOVCtb3FQHmSh9OGRIQ_-D705"> In the ordination of the priests a ram was used for a burnt offering. The burnt offering reminds us that we should be absolute for God yet we are not. As ordained priests of God, we should therefore receive His mercy and grace to be absolute for God in Christ, with Christ, and through Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="67dOgBo1e70S3A3lNxA9Fxx1D41uH2q9yYLlBn7LhMEcWP1VC14MaUjBJJcP9KtDT"> Since Aaron had been anointed by God, why did he still need the burnt offering? Aaron needed this offering because God wanted Aaron to be reminded that he should be absolute for God, yet he was not. This should remind us that we today are likewise not absolute for God. It should also warn us that every day we need to offer a burnt offering. Daily we need to offer a burnt offering for our priesthood, for our priestly service. The elders and co-workers in particular should offer the burnt offering every morning. We should tell the Lord, “Lord, throughout this day remind me that I should be absolute for You. Yet I realize that I am not and cannot be absolute for You. Lord, I trust in You and take You as my life, my person, and my absoluteness. My absoluteness for God is You, Lord.” This is to live Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="R36y4VgO7wqhNpNxDLl0OIeP9l1y2MnHC79X_ufmE0Wna47bAcYxxGOhmnV68pR00"> We may be familiar with the words “live Christ,” but we may not understand the real significance of living Christ. Do we live Christ at home and in the church life? In our family life and in our dealing with the saints, are we absolute for God? When our self-feeling or self-interest is touched by others, we may become offended. Does this not indicate that we are not absolute for God? We surely need to be reminded that, in ourselves, we are not absolute for God. </p>
<p data-content-id="sA3DT0shgAyQDQA-p8ePSMOBXDAnDm6lmg0vdxCAVblltDJck0V84lLYhSpuxHAEb"> According to Leviticus, the burnt offering should be offered every morning (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39196" data-verses="Leviticus 6:12-13">6:12-13</span>). The burning of the burnt offering should not cease. “The burnt offering itself shall be upon the hearth on the altar all night until the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39197" data-verses="Leviticus 6:9">6:9</span>). This indicates that the burnt offering should burn through the dark night of this age until morning, until the Lord Jesus comes again. <span class="pg" data-page-id="260" id="260">[260]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wC5_UtyIRPyB7WpxJOJXBMKGOb92GCN8AU3cnMbGoPMp8MiDs1CTFLNSZcpsTXlfK">IX. THE SECOND RAM AS THE CONSECRATION OFFERING FOR THE CONSECRATION<br/>OF THE PRIESTHOOD</h2><p data-content-id="LN8LqFsPX2mirpNVn3_Fl_N8FEwtTzowX3QYUfdcNcHOHUZ6TUtCG5uztkJS3CHT0"> The second ram was used as a consecration offering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39198" data-verses="Leviticus 7:37">7:37</span>) for the consecration of the priesthood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39199" data-verses="Leviticus 8:22-32">8:22-32</span>). This ram signifies the strong Christ for our assuming of the New Testament priesthood. We need a strong Christ for our consecration. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="mqLFmiP5_8OCpZzE87Nge8sMrJOFfmqJWkZYIFBzM8DlynnVp33_qIBdunbYlLH9U">A. Some of the Blood Put on Aaron’s and<br/>His Sons’ Right Ear, Thumb of Their Right Hand, and Big Toe of Their Right Foot</h2><p data-content-id="ZFdhXfV0GtQ7ozQy5uEoF65n96roOlqjdVAMW6C4PfTWSUVAOgHKQM3Y0B8x6f0De"> “Moses took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. And he brought Aaron’s sons near, and Moses put some of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39200" data-verses="Leviticus 8:23-24">8:23-24a</span>). This signifies that the redeeming blood of Christ cleanses our ears, our hands, and our feet for the assuming of our New Testament priesthood. The service of the New Testament priesthood includes functioning in the meetings, preaching the gospel, and visiting the saints in their homes. For all these services, we need the cleansing of the blood of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX99LAoSSDDp0sZ8GP9dslC6pGowqDOOXlVaDXIcuoHkKGg7wn__7mL30AgWcce-r"> Our moving (feet) and working (hands) are always under the direction of our hearing. We act according to what we hear. Therefore, in the church life, hearing is crucial. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fv8eruG2C4An5ussdVnkAb4c69j1cBFRCDYUBaT7z4c3XGWu7IZmTcTRA2UgLmbJe"> By hearing we have been saved, and by hearing we may be nourished and edified. However, by hearing we may also be damaged and killed, and we may do evil things to others because of what we hear. Our hearing is a problem. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39201" data-verses="2Timothy 4:3">2 Timothy 4:3</span> Paul speaks of those who “heap up to themselves teachers tickling the ear.” Therefore, God’s dealing must first touch the source—our hearing. </p>
<p data-content-id="CmWO4n8XWbzptjiYJJrutWL1BtwePtdWPFMX_iz9FQow2HICWW0e_sbr39oUdQ53H"> If any church would stop hearing negative things, that church would be very healthy and living. The church that is the weakest and the most deadened is the one full of criticism, gossip, and reasoning. <span class="pg" data-page-id="261" id="261">[261]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="PuyO3Sd3rtHDCrlUqHprqNkehrIM5ZNKJnWiDhMvDB-DvcclyKQkDsf8ThJYtKq9k"> The principle is the same in married life. A certain brother may be very living. But if his wife speaks to him in a negative way, he will be poisoned and deadened and will find it hard to pray in the church meeting. Likewise, if a brother passes on a negative word to his wife, she will be deadened by it. These illustrations from the church life and from married life show the importance of hearing. </p>

<p data-content-id="MPOCDFUKm8cVcjpGd7ROS35u43MXWGrsW0PImFA2Wzbc3DwzZLz1gDLcK7CSHAOA3"> Before we consider some further matters related to the consecration of Aaron and his sons, I would like to give an additional word concerning the application of the blood to the right ear, the right thumb, and the big toe of the right foot and also a word about putting the offering on the palms of the priests. </p>
<p data-content-id="V7B55sygWuttI4KoZ4bOSqhk2H8Bec2BybMHU3NWuBbXmv0xQiUlyWnEa-JNV4Dll"> Some of the blood of the ram of consecration was put on Aaron’s and his sons’ right ear, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot. This signifies that the redeeming blood of Christ cleanses our ears for hearing, our hands for working, and our feet for walking. This is for the assuming of our New Testament priesthood. </p>
<p data-content-id="ivxFinYAwLQi2teoWLAO0sXYhaEr38tRoutdjeTon_4zq6XLkUjUpOe_VDOm3Pn7t"> Our hearing is mentioned first because it affects our working and our moving. The blood of Christ deals with our ear for listening to God’s word, to God’s speaking. To serve God as priests, we should be faithful slaves, or servants, to God. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39211" data-verses="Isaiah 50:4-5">Isaiah 50:4 and 5</span> indicate, a servant must have a hearing ear. A servant who does not listen to his master’s word cannot serve him according to his will, heart, and desire. </p>
<p data-content-id="187ceXh_NbRnYyu1mrKM_o0_bxjosDgQKRD-2KHDg7OF95AMtokSZlUzK2LV54vgN"> When we were sinners, we did not have an ear to listen to God’s word, to God’s speaking. Daily we listened to many other things, but we did not listen to the word of God. Now that we have been saved and ordained as God’s priests, His servants, the primary thing is to listen to God’s speaking. In typology, when a slave wanted to stay with his master, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="266" id="266">[266]</span> master brought him to the doorpost and pierced his ear (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39212" data-verses="Exodus 21:2-6">Exo. 21:2-6</span>), indicating that the slave must be keen to listen to the master’s word. As God’s priests today, we must learn to listen to His word. </p>
<p data-content-id="BbO8eSfTx5R84H_f9kv8JKRdnG3T0cqg7Rva48wPNAlxcvoNCVQHbME6iRkopNA5y"> The first thing that we as God’s priests need to deal with is our listening. Positive listening will rescue us from negative listening. If we listen to God’s word from morning to evening, we will not have an ear to listen to any negative speaking. Negative talk prevails and spreads in the church life because certain ones turn their ears from God to something else. These ones do not speak Christ, the word of God, grace, or the gospel. Instead, they listen to negative things, and they work and move according to the negative things they hear. The result is the spreading of death. If we turn our ears from other things back to God Himself, there will not be any problems, and only life will be spreading, not death. </p>
<p data-content-id="xpuW_vPofBGDzDc22724t8RGY5jnS0BSr8301X99RY97AKbZvApQctIkumW21xaSQ"> The principle is the same in our married life. If a sister wants to have a good husband, she should not speak to him negatively but should talk to him about God, Christ, grace, the gospel, and the divine light. This kind of speaking will build up her husband and cause him to seek the Lord. However, if she speaks negatively to her husband, she will deaden him. The same is true, both positively and negatively, of the way a brother speaks to his wife. We all need to be careful about our listening. We need to have the redeeming blood of Christ applied to our ear, our thumb, and our toe. </p>
<p data-content-id="rCeQBKNuXLnpxNKjpL-6rcvuRmEO9HB5ztp7_KErmZE1m7T-GugDdoJ0xk-AO9IMP"> The cleansing of the right ear, the right thumb, and the big toe of the right foot was needed on two occasions: at the ordination of the priests and at the time of the cleansing of a leper (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39213" data-verses="Leviticus 14:14">Lev. 14:14</span>). Both the lepers and the priests needed to have their ear, thumb, and toe cleansed with the redeeming blood. This indicates that in the eyes of God we sinners who have been ordained as God’s priests are lepers. As God’s priests, His servants, we need to have our ears redeemed from listening to anything other than God and have them brought back to listening to the word of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="267" id="267">[267]</span> Also, we need to have our working hand redeemed from doing anything other than God’s work. Furthermore, our toe for walking also needs to be redeemed. </p>
<p data-content-id="dUhqhQwKWbXKSbqvLKXmrZOfu6OXO9A-m0V4pRJtqQPpDGovAqJWJcKK1hwOATnaE"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39214" data-verses="Leviticus 8:26-28">8:26-28</span> we see that one unleavened cake, one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer (belonging to the meal offering) were placed upon the portions of the fat and the right thigh (another category of offerings). These two categories of offerings as a whole were put on the palms of Aaron and his sons. At that point, the hands of Aaron and of his sons were no longer empty. These offerings were then waved before Jehovah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39215" data-verses="Leviticus 8:27">v. 27</span>), probably by those whose hands had been filled with them. This waving signifies Christ’s move in His resurrection. The offerings were first “killed,” and then they were waved, that is, resurrected, thereby becoming offerings before Jehovah in Christ’s resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="QrptJJxnlubdylPzgsOm36qgA-PH2LPyv1OlLurgtE73Y3Ur-McK8L5I1R7Ma9Rtr"> The two cakes, the wafer, the fat, and the thigh were then offered up in smoke (indicating a slow burning to bring out the flavor) upon the burnt offering for a consecration offering by fire to Jehovah for a satisfying fragrance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39216" data-verses="Leviticus 8:28">v. 28</span>). This satisfying fragrance is for God alone; it is His portion for His enjoyment. The tender, excellent parts (the fat), the strong part (the right thigh), and the two cakes and the one wafer—signifying different aspects of Christ’s sinless and Spirit-mingled humanity—are food not for the priests but for God. God’s portion was offered on the altar, which signifies the cross. This indicates that we offer God’s food in the fellowship of Christ’s suffering unto the death of the cross. Although this is for God’s satisfaction, it is also for our assuming of the New Testament priesthood. </p>
<p data-content-id="Kbr2zMFu7prMv589VrFoje5GL-W_abKZ7yQ9bjy8JdXHTAd4mjuWZo9eiEivMyu1q"> We may proclaim the fact that we are God’s priests, but probably none among us ever realized how many matters are involved in being a priest. Fifty-five years ago I did not know that I needed the sin offering to remind me that I am nothing but flesh, an old man in the old creation who is linked with Satan, the world, and the struggle for power. I claimed to be a priest of God, yet I practiced my priesthood in ignorance. I did not know that to be a priest in the New Testament priesthood I needed Christ’s humanity, His <span class="pg" data-page-id="268" id="268">[268]</span> strengthening power, and His loving capacity (signified by the breast waved as a wave offering—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39217" data-verses="Leviticus 8:29">v. 29</span>). If we all check our past, God’s light of grace will expose where we were as God’s priests—in the old creation, in the flesh, and in the natural life with the natural love, the natural affection. Concerning this, we all need to be exposed and cleansed. We need the cleansing blood on the tip of our right ear, on our right thumb, and on the big toe of our right foot. </p>

This signifies that God sprinkles us, the New Testament priests, and our conduct (garments), with the compounded Spirit and the redeeming blood of the cross of Christ to separate us, to make us holy unto Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="4mdq3y0cOc3Dr86Vjcerq3eksY40PYlfe9OOpxJJ8hAcXLR1eihN1Srq4IoiphC0s"> No matter how much God has been working on us, dealing with our sin, our natural life, and the old man, we still need more “coats” of the anointing oil. The anointing oil refers to the processed Triune God with all that He has become, has done, and has passed through. Such a Triune God, who has been processed and has been compounded with the “spices” of incarnation, human living, an all-inclusive death, a wonderful resurrection, and an excellent ascension, has become the anointing oil, the ointment, to “paint” us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39219" data-verses="Exodus 30:23-30">Exo. 30:23-30</span>). We need to be painted again and again with the processed Triune God as the anointing oil. </p>
<p data-content-id="o5HGAna4E3UbMG7NGiSbaPllSm3RmYoLI3dKIr2iVbybx3hEM_7DGG6BX7Kk3dEPS"> In order to have the proper knowledge of our New Testament priesthood, we need to study the book of Leviticus. Leviticus is not only for the Old Testament saints. If we understand the typology of this book, we will see that point after point applies to us in a practical way today. <span class="pg" data-page-id="269" id="269">[269]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="R36y4VgO7wqhNpNxDLl0OIeL1l1j5MnHC79X_ufmE0Wna47bAcYxxGOhmnV68pR00"> The book of Leviticus shows us a new beginning, in which, for the first time, God’s people offered offerings to God according to God’s regulations. This was the first time God’s people offered Christ to God not merely according to their need but also according to God’s laws, His regulations. Before that time, some, such as Abel, Noah, and Abraham, offered to God, but it was not until the Israelites kept the Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39231" data-verses="Exodus 12:1-28">Exo. 12:1-28</span>) that offerings were presented to God according to His instructions. Strictly speaking, although the Passover lamb was an offering, it was not called an offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="sA3DT0shgAyQDQA-p8ePSMOFfDA6Pm6lmg0vdxCAVblltDJck0V84lLYhSpuxHAEb"> In Leviticus, after the erecting of the tabernacle, God had a dwelling place on earth from within which He spoke to His people. The first category of speaking concerned the offerings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39232" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">Lev. 1—7</span>). The offerings were not only needed by man and requested by God but were also ordained by God in regulations which were absolutely according to God’s mind and desire. Moses should have realized the significance of these offerings in regard to the matter of expiation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39233" data-verses="Leviticus 9:7">Lev. 9:7</span>), yet in the details of the offerings he may have understood very little. </p>
<p data-content-id="wC5_UtyIRPyB7WpxJOJXBMKCGb9vLCN8AU3cnMbGoPMp8MiDs1CTFLNSZcpsTXlfK"> In Leviticus the Israelites began to practice offering to God in a way which had never been done before. The offerings were now offered to God not by an individual but by a people, a congregation, and not at the place of their choice. God asked the people to come to the entrance of the tent of meeting to contact Him and to offer their offerings by priests, not by themselves. (This is different from the offering of the offerings by Abel, Noah, and Abraham, who were <span class="pg" data-page-id="272" id="272">[272]</span> not only offerers but serving priests.) The manner in which the offerings were offered became a ceremony, a form, to be carried out before God at the entrance of His dwelling place according to His regulations, laws, and arrangement. All this was surely something new. </p>
<p data-content-id="LN8LqFsPX2mirpNVn3_Fl_N4NEwIRzowX3QYUfdcNcHOHUZ6TUtCG5uztkJS3CHT0"> Although Moses did not see that the offerings were Christ, God was actually giving commands to His people about how to apply Christ as all the offerings according to God’s laws. We today need to learn how to apply Christ according to God’s requests. Early in the morning, we need to apply Christ as our burnt offering, sin offering, and meal offering so that we may have something to live by during the day. </p>
<p data-content-id="mqLFmiP5_8OCpZzE87Nge8sIjJOkcmqJWkZYIFBzM8DlynnVp33_qIBdunbYlLH9U"> Let us now consider the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39234" data-verses="Leviticus 9:1-21">Leviticus 9:1-21</span> regarding the initiation of the priestly service of Aaron and his sons. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="LN8LqFsPX2mirpNVn3_Fl_N4NEwtbzowX3QYUfdcNcHOHUZ6TUtCG5uztkJS3CHT0">I. ON THE EIGHTH DAY</h2><p data-content-id="mqLFmiP5_8OCpZzE87Nge8sIjJOFXmqJWkZYIFBzM8DlynnVp33_qIBdunbYlLH9U"> The initiation of the priestly service of Aaron and his sons took place on the eighth day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39235" data-verses="Leviticus 9:1">v. 1</span>), which signifies resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39236" data-verses="Mark 16:9">Mark 16:9a</span>). This indicates that all the priestly service must be in resurrection (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39237" data-verses="Revelation 20:6">Rev. 20:6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="ZFdhXfV0GtQ7ozQy5uEoF65j16rkMlqjdVAMW6C4PfTWSUVAOgHKQM3Y0B8x6f0De"> The eighth day in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39238" data-verses="Leviticus 9:1">Leviticus 9:1</span> refers to the day after the seven days of the consecration of Aaron and his sons. During each of these seven days, Aaron and his sons went through the same procedure. On the eighth day, the day after that course of consecration, they had a new beginning. The eighth day thus implies both a new beginning and the ending of the oldness. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX99LAoSSDDp0sZ8GP9dslC-hGo8oDOOXlVaDXIcuoHkKGg7wn__7mL30AgWcce-r"> As priests of God, our priesthood, our priestly service, must be altogether in resurrection. The natural life, the old man, and the flesh have no ground here. Unfortunately, however, in our actual church life there are many natural things, and there is much oldness. Such things are not on the eighth day; that is, they are not in the realm of resurrection but in the realm of the natural life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fv8eruG2C4An5ussdVnkAb4Yy9j5aBFRCDYUBaT7z4c3XGWu7IZmTcTRA2UgLmbJe"> We condemn evil things, but we may not condemn those good things which are done in the old creation. For example, <span class="pg" data-page-id="273" id="273">[273]</span> we condemn hatred, but we may not condemn a love which is natural and not in the Spirit. In the New Testament, on the contrary, there is a concern regarding natural love, which is actually a kind of “honey.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39239" data-verses="Leviticus 2:1">Leviticus 2</span>, neither leaven nor honey was allowed to be added to the meal offering. Leaven refers to what is evil, and honey, to what is naturally good. Whereas natural hatred is leaven, natural love is honey. Natural hatred is evil, but natural love is good. However, both good and evil are from the same source—the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Since natural hatred and natural love are natural, both belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; and since both belong to this tree, both should be condemned. This is the reason that when, in the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus was asked questions regarding good and evil, right and wrong, yes and no, He referred the people to life. The Lord’s concern is life, not good and evil. </p>
<p data-content-id="CmWO4n8XWbzptjiYJJrutWLxJtwSJtdWPFMX_iz9FQow2HICWW0e_sbr39oUdQ53H"> The priestly service we render to God must be in resurrection. The reality of resurrection is Christ as the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39240" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>). Anything we do in the Spirit is on the eighth day, in resurrection. Anything we do outside the Spirit, in our natural life, mind, or emotion, is not on the eighth day, not in resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="PuyO3Sd3rtHDCrlUqHprqNkaprIA7ZNKJnWiDhMvDB-DvcclyKQkDsf8ThJYtKq9k"> I hope that all the saints, including the newly saved ones, will receive this word concerning the priestly service on the eighth day. When you intend to show love toward a particular person, you need to consider whether this love arises from your spirit or from your natural emotion. Is this love a matter of your natural likes or dislikes, a matter of liking one person but not another? Further, because of your natural love for a certain one, you may treat that one in a preferential way. This is honey, and honey eventually ferments and becomes the same as leaven. This means that, in the eyes of God, natural love is just as evil as natural hatred. </p>
<p data-content-id="-PeHukwbm9F9hxNjtJPlj6vk8-HFEXPXqV79a6e9f-uRqp0PM1xtx1OvvtRGpg6pH"> Quite often the Lord will require us to love someone whom we cannot love in our natural life and with our natural love. The only way we can love that one is with a love which <span class="pg" data-page-id="274" id="274">[274]</span> is not natural but is in resurrection. All our service must be in spirit, in resurrection. </p>

AARON PREPARING HIS<br/>SIN OFFERING AND HIS BURNT OFFERING<br/>AND MAKING EXPIATION<br/>FOR HIMSELF AND FOR THE PEOPLE</h2><p data-content-id="vSQYV8H55L1lGrY7ZUxst6h3nhsi0mieBZUCxoEnjcViCSP5VYMPeX6RAh2edvmD6"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39241" data-verses="Leviticus 9:7">Leviticus 9:7</span> says, “Then Moses said to Aaron, Come near to the altar and prepare your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make expiation for yourself and for the people; and prepare the offering of the people, and make expiation for them, as Jehovah has commanded.” In this verse we see that Aaron was to make expiation for himself and for the people. The term <em>expiation</em> needs to be distinguished from the terms <em>redemption</em> and <em>atonement,</em> for these words do not have the same meaning; there are important differences. Redemption was completed by the Lord Jesus’ death on the cross and this term should be used only for the New Testament. Before He shed His blood on the cross, there was not such a thing as redemption. What we have in the Old Testament is expiation. Sometimes the Hebrew word for expiation is translated “atonement.” Atonement is a matter of at-one-ment; it refers to appeasing the situation between two parties in order to bring them together, to make them one. Expiation refers to the appeasing of a situation between two parties by doing something for one party to satisfy the demands of the other party. </p>
<p data-content-id="WlA3awOYhU9znfuKt6dvGiqkUUYwA0tfDhtg3P_T8AseHPoPSWYPV6PMcXDqPbKl8"> As sinners, we had a problem with our righteous God. Although He loved us, something unrighteous existed between us and Him. Not until this unrighteous situation was appeased could we be one with God. Therefore, on the cross Christ accomplished redemption for us. Christ not only shed His blood to accomplish redemption, but in His ascension He entered into the heavens and presented His blood before God. Through this presentation of His blood, He acquired, gained, an eternal redemption for us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39242" data-verses="Hebrews 9:12">Heb. 9:12</span>). When we believed into Christ, we entered into Him and received this redemption. <span class="pg" data-page-id="275" id="275">[275]</span> </p>

It is difficult to speak about the result of our priesthood because this issue is not something material but something spiritual, mysterious, heavenly, and divine. The issue of the New Testament priestly service is the appearing of God to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39254" data-verses="Leviticus 9:4">v. 4</span>), the appearing of God’s glory to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39255" data-verses="Leviticus 9:6">vv. 6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39256" data-verses="Leviticus 9:23">23b</span>), the divine blessing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39257" data-verses="Leviticus 9:22-23">vv. 22-23</span>), and the consuming fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39258" data-verses="Leviticus 9:24">v. 24</span>). Let us now consider each of these matters. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="pOQyt1gjzS1vZpd150kJXgoSWoVwTeJdrM5O10orBdv0cPWAhLe2gIJMOqxTtjK6d">I. THE APPEARING OF GOD TO US</h2><p data-content-id="vSQYV8H55L1lGrY7ZUxst6h3khs73mieBZUCxoEnjcViCSP5VYMPeX6RAh2edvmD6"> The appearing of God to us is related to our taking Christ as the offerings. As we confess our mistakes, failures, and wrongdoings, we spontaneously take Christ as our sin offering and trespass offering. This may lead us to take Him as our burnt offering. We may tell Him, “Lord Jesus, You are my burnt offering. I cannot be absolute for God, but You can. Now I take You, Lord, as my absoluteness for God.” This kind of prayer indicates that we desire to live Christ for God’s satisfaction. The sin offering and the burnt offering will then lead us to take Christ as the meal offering. We will offer the top portion to God as His food, and we will feed on Christ as our daily food, as our daily life supply. Furthermore, we will be brought into a sense of peace, into a tranquil situation, and enjoy Christ as our peace, rest, satisfaction, and comfort. As the issue of taking Christ as all these offerings, God’s presence will be with us. This is the appearing of God to us. We cannot see Him or touch Him in a physical way, but we have the sense that He has appeared to <span class="pg" data-page-id="280" id="280">[280]</span> us. Unable to deny the sense that God has appeared to us, we will want to worship and adore Him, offering to Him our praise and thanksgiving. This is the experience of the appearing of God to us as the result of our priestly service. We should have such an experience not only early in the morning but also during the day. </p>
<p data-content-id="WlA3awOYhU9znfuKt6dvGiqkXUYZK0tfDhtg3P_T8AseHPoPSWYPV6PMcXDqPbKl8"> We may experience God’s appearing to us in different situations. For example, we may enjoy God’s appearing while we are preaching the gospel. In our gospel preaching we may apply Christ as the offerings, and as a result we enjoy the appearing of God to us. Often we have this enjoyment in the church meetings. God may appear to us even as we are taking a walk. </p>
<p data-content-id="2RckI5Ct4Iw0lfg0o-7qXnsYZetrFcK0dqFXHy3GZc1Qzj85J-8LmfOv-1xMzMlJ0"> Our New Testament priesthood issues in the enjoyment of God in His appearing. Usually God’s appearing will be tranquil and cause us to be silent. Sometimes God will sovereignly arrange our circumstances to match the tranquility of His appearing. At such times it seems that the entire universe is quiet and that we and God are alone. This tranquil appearing of God is the first result of our New Testament priestly service. </p>

When we serve God in our spirit by enjoying Christ according to God’s regulations, we will enjoy God’s appearing, which is often followed by the appearing of God’s glory. God’s glory is God expressed. When God is expressed, that is glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="3lBTmaq9moHRumeUlLI0z9-5cbb9IhxeMZAEbbLWdHR7eQxL9TMP84tRESuFndxAt"> When we serve God with Christ as the offerings according to God’s regulations and not according to our own choice, we will often enjoy the appearing of God’s glory. We will see God expressed in different ways. For example, when we enter the home of an unbeliever for the preaching of the gospel, we may sense God’s glory manifested in our speaking or in his expression or attitude toward us. Furthermore, we often enjoy God’s glory, His expression, in the church meetings. Perhaps a particular meeting is not very living, but <span class="pg" data-page-id="281" id="281">[281]</span> then someone offers a living prayer, and the meeting is resurrected and revived. At such a time we may sense that God is expressed in glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="G8WifseOG75eXksZ0Xg3wn7EbetEB8YfLcO9OTK3bDlF2oEvqaaac2VQzRzH11-xg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39259" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span> Paul wrote concerning the glory of the Old Testament ministry and the glory of the New Testament ministry. “Now if the ministry of death, in letters engraved in stone, came in glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to gaze at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, which was being done away, how shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit be in glory? For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39260" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:7-9">vv. 7-9</span>). With Moses, who had the Old Testament ministry of death and condemnation, there was a glory, a physical glory, on his face. We who have the ministry of the New Testament, of the Spirit and of righteousness, have a glory in life and in spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="cEGQRZcEFdiSW_luPEGi_zuPk8CLYnBiAywbXPclmSQESewfF2_kdR7dnAPblMLTy"> The Christian meeting is wonderful and mysterious because it is related to God. The Lord Jesus said, “Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39261" data-verses="Matthew 18:20">Matt. 18:20</span>). We believe that the Lord is with us in every meeting, but He is present in different ways and, depending on our situation in the meetings, He causes us to have different kinds of senses regarding the meeting. For instance, on one occasion He may cause us to have a sense of deadness to indicate that our situation is wrong. On another occasion He may stir up everyone in the meeting, and all the attendants will have the sense that God is stirring them up. This kind of stirring up is altogether divine, and in it God appears to us in His glory, in His expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="YDsRD7ifPw-lp8lc5xue-reh0PbMJOgMuQ4KkOc2H7hurUt1fU4NGccyn3CnOpDOB"> The appearing of God’s glory in the church meetings is related to our enjoyment of Christ as the offerings. If in a church of two hundred saints, sixty would enjoy Christ as the offerings all day, in the evening when they come together, the appearing of God and the very expression of God would be among them. Their coming together into the name of Christ is the expression of God. However, the situation would be the opposite if none of the saints enjoyed Christ as <span class="pg" data-page-id="282" id="282">[282]</span> the offerings. Their coming together would not be the expression of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Eo8_f6xczFEz8Dhy4DUKmRXJtdtvEuIMuEdkcPMoX47E1B39u_MgRBsuwxjcPeLGZ"> The atmosphere of the meetings indicates what we are with God. No one can pretend. The meeting is truly an exhibition of our Christian life, in particular, of the degree to which we enjoy Christ in our private daily life and in our family life. Our meeting is an exhibition of our actual enjoyment of Christ. If we enjoy Christ, the meeting will be an exhibition of the riches of Christ. If we do not enjoy Christ, there will not be an exhibition of the riches of Christ in the meeting. In this matter shouting and praising do not help, for the meeting is not under our control. The point here is that our experience of Christ affects the meetings; it especially affects, even determines, the atmosphere of the church meetings. </p>
<p data-content-id="DAXcbsbzMAWBUrvVTy0dqdzOV2I0d5ymf8MzGShj-RTqJixX3OkvHHtouXshNnro9"> The atmosphere of the meetings is an indication of the appearing of God’s glory, and this appearing depends on the ministering of Christ as the offerings. When we minister Christ as the different offerings, we enjoy Him, and those to whom we minister also enjoy Him. This will affect the atmosphere of the meetings because it will issue in the appearing of God’s glory to us. </p>

AARON BLESSING THE PEOPLE</h2><p data-content-id="ge3wnxIwGxa4rrtSyd1Wi9Tv0OsAo5UCxwpTMeqQUEqdRe-NF0C2fsGQOIKlAT22Z"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39262" data-verses="Leviticus 9:22">Leviticus 9:22</span> says, “Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.” This signifies that Christ as our High Priest after His crucifixion blessed us in His resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39263" data-verses="Luke 24:50">Luke 24:50</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="ehZiAV472AzUxzKg22tugFXAjhYFl3FEbtMfczCI5c6oYys5LccddxEzqypM7CPIR"> The Lord in His resurrection is with us all the days until the consummation of the age (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39264" data-verses="Matthew 28:20">Matt. 28:20</span>). The Lord’s presence with us is His blessing. As long as we have His presence, we are under His blessing. When His blessing is with us, even our mistakes become blessings. But without His presence, even if we are right in everything, there is nothing but vanity. Although our High Priest has gone into the heavens, He is still present with us, and His presence is <span class="pg" data-page-id="283" id="283">[283]</span> a blessing not only in the church life but also in our family life and in our practical daily life. </p>
<p data-content-id="5c5lLvOTxKbegnfVCkujIZCY2iZ2P8xQJy4GzCHBtPSGykqXudXnQpZPgRpmmqveb"> The Lord’s presence as our blessing comes to us through our application of Him as all the offerings. Every day we need to apply Christ as our sin offering, burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering. If we apply Him as these offerings, we will have His blessing, which is His presence. </p>

<p data-content-id="JYgdOTAphL2MixIdDMe3gVg3lZqwFUwH83TVGMXXC5x0rPf1TViep-9RX2Pq_QKeG"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39277" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">chapters one through nine</span> of Leviticus, we have seen the offerings and their laws, the consecration of Aaron and his sons, the initiation of the priestly service, and the issue of the priestly service. The issue of the priestly service includes the appearing of God, the appearing of God’s glory, the blessing of the people, and fire coming out from before God and consuming the burnt offering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39278" data-verses="Leviticus 9:24">9:24</span>). This consuming fire, which represents God’s holiness, is used by God in two different kinds of situations, one positive and the other negative. In a positive situation, when we have something for God and offer it to God, He accepts it by consuming it with fire. This consuming is positive; it is the divine acceptance of what we are, what we do, and what we have for God. In a negative situation, holy fire comes from God as judgment. Such a negative case—the case of Nadab and Abihu—is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39279" data-verses="Leviticus 10:1-11">Leviticus 10:1-11</span>, the section which we will consider in this message. </p>
<p data-content-id="zLs19c8l0fJmVCIlaXT2eNrC17Rx9xx4r18qhLGRHCQGX8rX56yBc-Lf9eVsYHyhn"> The case of Nadab and Abihu in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39280" data-verses="Leviticus 10:1-11">10:1-11</span> goes together with the events of the previous chapter. It seems that this sad case happened on the same day in which “fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed the burnt offering and the portions of fat on the altar” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39281" data-verses="Leviticus 9:24">9:24</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="abOlojkYEV6S5Nyw1iDNLhoRXhZNdxNgoVyybWxTCvwbL9IKdQKnhKWGzjO26wOAP"> Nadab and Abihu, sons of Aaron, did something that seemingly was good: they offered something to God. However, they offered “strange fire” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39282" data-verses="Leviticus 10:1">10:1</span>), common fire, not fire from the heavens. God judged this offering of strange fire by <span class="pg" data-page-id="288" id="288">[288]</span> consuming the two priests who offered it. This shows us, on the one hand, that God is merciful and kind, and, on the other hand, that He is quite severe and strict. After the blessings of that excellent and glorious day in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39283" data-verses="Leviticus 9:1">chapter nine</span>, the day of God’s initiation of the application of Christ to His people for their enjoyment, we might have tolerated the mistake recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39284" data-verses="Leviticus 10:1">chapter ten</span>. But with God there was no tolerance. Immediately after God blessed, He judged. </p>
<p data-content-id="bMciakEq1jnYyMA9zOc4fi_2AFBb40kBRXyiszf2beiMhuuovJ4PBc3b8Pwvp8oTA"> The consuming of the offerings by the heavenly fire was altogether positive. That consuming was a strong confirmation that God is the true and living God and that He was with His people, the people of Israel. Furthermore, this consuming by fire was a confirmation of what Moses had done and of what he had told the people about God. Before that time, the Israelites might have wondered what kind of God they had, for they had heard about Him through Moses, but they had not seen Him. Now there was a particular day with all kinds of laws, regulations, and offerings, a day that was formal and official. On this day God’s glory appeared, and His blessing came upon His people. Furthermore, on this day there was the divine acceptance of the offerings. This acceptance came in the form of consuming fire. This fire came down from heaven; it was not from the earth, and it did not originate with the children of Israel. When fire came from heaven to the very spot—the altar—where the offerings were and consumed the offerings, the people saw it, shouted, and fell on their faces (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39285" data-verses="Leviticus 9:24">9:24b</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="pOQyt1gjzS1vZpd150kJXgoSXoVtZeJdrM5O10orBdv0cPWAhLe2gIJMOqxTtjK6d"> Not long afterward, the consuming fire appeared again but in a negative way. Instead of accepting, the holy fire judged. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39286" data-verses="Leviticus 9:1">chapter nine</span> the holy fire consumed in the sense of accepting; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39287" data-verses="Leviticus 10:1">chapter ten</span> the holy fire consumed in the sense of judging. Concerning Nadab and Abihu, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39288" data-verses="Leviticus 10:2">10:2</span> says, “Fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed them, and they died before Jehovah.” A similar thing occurred in Acts. On the day of Pentecost the glory of God came down from heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39289" data-verses="Acts 2:1-4">Acts 2:1-4</span>), but not long afterward a couple cheated the Holy Spirit and died as a result (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39290" data-verses="Acts 5:1-11">Acts 5:1-11</span>). In the case in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39291" data-verses="Leviticus 10:1">Leviticus 10</span>, the offering of something not <span class="pg" data-page-id="289" id="289">[289]</span> sanctified, a common, worldly fire, brought in judgment. The holy, heavenly fire consumed Nadab and Abihu, and they died. </p>
<p data-content-id="vSQYV8H55L1lGrY7ZUxst6h3lhsi8mieBZUCxoEnjcViCSP5VYMPeX6RAh2edvmD6"> The more we consider the case of Nadab and Abihu, the more we realize that God is not only merciful but also holy, not only kind but also severe. Therefore, we should not be careless in serving Him or in touching the divine things. </p>
<p data-content-id="WlA3awOYhU9znfuKt6dvGiqkWUY8C0tfDhtg3P_T8AseHPoPSWYPV6PMcXDqPbKl8"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39292" data-verses="Leviticus 10:9-10">Leviticus 10:9 and 10</span> say, “Do not drink wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you come into the tent of meeting, that you may not die; it is a perpetual statute throughout your generations, that you may make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean.” This charge indicates that the reason Nadab and Abihu offered strange fire might have been that they were drunk with wine. This made them loose and careless and caused them to act without fear. As a result, they suffered God’s holy judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="2RckI5Ct4Iw0lfg0o-7qXnsYYetKMcK0dqFXHy3GZc1Qzj85J-8LmfOv-1xMzMlJ0"> In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, the principle is the same concerning the result of carelessness in serving God and in touching the divine things. In the case both of Nadab and Abihu and of Ananias and Sapphira the result was death. This shows us that the careless touching of the divine things is serious and may result in death. According to the New Testament, this death may not be physical but spiritual. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugJdCXLu0ey6qT0teoiBGH7QEsymcqFo8Xz3Iczpu7TrQaSjH1QUlKlNLKEP00tlJ"> Let us now consider in some detail the case of Nadab and Abihu. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="f1SdNSV-jnmqSNmLFj2KduK2GlcbFoF0g5vVSa13IQ9kvvIAb-D_3fsbMnQfG6L1R">I. THE LESSON OF NADAB AND ABIHU</h2><p data-content-id="IcDSKk0-zyd2G7hWO-1B3c82-IznjjtjBspMyxBYA_3Aefgwi8mVa14ggFd5zUntv"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39293" data-verses="Leviticus 10:1-11">10:1-11</span> we have the lesson of Nadab and Abihu. The consuming of Nadab and Abihu probably took place at the end of the day of glory and blessing described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39294" data-verses="Leviticus 9:1">chapter nine</span>. What happened to these two sons of Aaron is surely a lesson for us today. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="HomP821jsfmQ8p43kMxD4q8mQ34joTThflkEC69_mme9_M6bdRalURihY94i1Wws0">A. Nadab and Abihu<br/>Offering Strange Fire before Jehovah</h2><p data-content-id="XgZNVEXVlLg7OJdTmWIsMv5Y0E3kmo8X5u0Ynp1K0k7DMJm_eLaooWZ29TKHlzJPK"> “The sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, each took his <span class="pg" data-page-id="290" id="290">[290]</span> censer and put fire in it, and placed incense upon it, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which He had not commanded them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39295" data-verses="Leviticus 10:1">v. 1</span>). This signifies man’s natural enthusiasm, natural affection, natural strength, and natural ability offered to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="k1b_-LdFaDzH5eTjPaqBvcmDpKHYvaDHUrgPD1q4xSXGU2fRRcrs_GWJkW-01a5uN"> Nadab and Abihu were not judged because they did something that was not for God. They were judged because they acted according to the natural life. They did something for God, but they did it in a natural way. They might have loved God, but they loved Him in a natural way. </p>
<p data-content-id="JYgdOTAphL2MixIdDMe3gVg3lZqhPUwH83TVGMXXC5x0rPf1TViep-9RX2Pq_QKeG"> We should be burning for the Lord and hot; however, our hotness should not be natural but spiritual. We progress from being natural to being spiritual by taking the way of the cross. Whatever we are in the natural life should be crossed out. The natural man has already been crucified with Christ. Now in our Christian life and walk we need to hold the attitude that our natural man has been crucified and must be set aside. Since the natural life has already been condemned, we should condemn it today. We need to realize that our natural man has been judged by God on the cross, and for this reason it should not be regarded or honored. </p>
<p data-content-id="zLs19c8l0fJmVCIlaXT2eNrC17Rk2xx4r18qhLGRHCQGX8rX56yBc-Lf9eVsYHyhn"> Our serving in the church and our testifying in the meetings can easily be natural. If we speak in the meetings in a natural way, we will offer strange, or common, fire, and this will bring in spiritual death. Whenever we testify in a natural way, our being is deadened, and the meeting with its atmosphere also is deadened. </p>
<p data-content-id="abOlojkYEV6S5Nyw1iDNLhoRXhZkVxNgoVyybWxTCvwbL9IKdQKnhKWGzjO26wOAP"> We all need to learn not to touch the holy things of God with the natural life. Not only should the things be right, but the way should also be right. It is not adequate simply to do the right thing. We must do the right thing in the right way. To offer strange fire to God is to do the right thing in the wrong way, and this brings in the judgment of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="bMciakEq1jnYyMA9zOc4fi_2AFB2x0kBRXyiszf2beiMhuuovJ4PBc3b8Pwvp8oTA"> It is not easy to be purified from being natural. We may often exercise our natural enthusiasm, natural affection, natural strength, or natural ability. Everything natural in us needs to be dealt with. <span class="pg" data-page-id="291" id="291">[291]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="qrtD4k7nSUxKl3L1F9HYvF1C3nTDeWZnHU9tH7v7LVX2V0M-w6m_gV8s2EafX305n"> The life of Moses is an illustration of dealing with the natural man. Moses said that “the days of our years are threescore years and ten” and that “by reason of strength” they may be fourscore years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39296" data-verses="Psalms 90:10">Psa. 90:10</span>). According to his understanding, the age of eighty marks the end of man’s life. It is significant, therefore, that Moses was called by God when he was eighty years old. This indicates that Moses’ natural life had come to an end and that whatever he did for God was in resurrection. At the age of eighty Moses had a new beginning, and from then on he did not act according to his natural life but according to a resurrection spirit. </p>

THE REGULATIONS FOR THE PRIESTS</h2><p data-content-id="rCeQBKNuXLnpxNKjpL-6rcvuVmEr1HB5ztp7_KErmZE1m7T-GugDdoJ0xk-AO9IMP"> Although on a day of glory, a day full of blessing and enjoyment, something severe happened to Aaron (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39309" data-verses="Leviticus 10:1-11">10:1-11</span>), in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39310" data-verses="Leviticus 10:12">10:12</span> we have a further expression of God’s mercy and grace. “Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who remained, Take the meal offering that remains of the offerings of Jehovah by fire and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy.” This verse speaks not of the burnt offering, the sin offering, or the trespass offering but the meal offering. The meal offering here is a matter of God’s mercy and grace. To our thought, immediately after the correction in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39311" data-verses="Leviticus 10:1-11">10:1-11</span>, Aaron and his sons needed a sin offering. But Moses told them to eat the meal offering. Something was presented to Aaron and his sons for their eating. To give others something to eat at the time of need is to show them mercy. </p>
<p data-content-id="dUhqhQwKWbXKSbqvLKXmrZOfq6O2H9A-m0V4pRJtqQPpDGovAqJWJcKK1hwOATnaE"> The holy fire that consumed Nadab and Abihu was for judgment. This judgment was exercised not on unbelievers but on God’s people. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39312" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:27-32">1 Corinthians 11:27-32</span>, this kind of judgment is a disciplinary punishment, a merciful correction, not a judgment for perdition. The judgment of God on Aaron’s two sons did not terminate God’s mercy on <span class="pg" data-page-id="296" id="296">[296]</span> His people. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39313" data-verses="Leviticus 10:12">Leviticus 10:12</span> indicates, here God’s mercy went along with His punishment and correction. </p>

This signifies that the remaining part of Christ in His humanity as our meal offering is for us, the New Testament priests, to enjoy as our portion. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39315" data-verses="Leviticus 2:1">Leviticus 2</span>, the top portion of the meal offering, with the frankincense, was to be offered to God by fire. The remainder of the meal offering was for the priests. As the meal offering, Christ is firstly for God’s satisfaction, and then He is for our enjoyment and satisfaction. </p>
<p data-content-id="ehZiAV472AzUxzKg22tugFXAlhYJn3FEbtMfczCI5c6oYys5LccddxEzqypM7CPIR"> Once again I would emphasize the fact that the meal offering in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39316" data-verses="Leviticus 10:12-13">verses 12 and 13</span> comes immediately after the disciplinary judgment upon Nadab and Abihu and indicates that God is merciful. After this death-judgment Moses did not say, “Aaron, you have made mistakes, and now is the time for you to offer a sin offering to God.” Rather, instead of telling Aaron and his sons to offer a sin offering or a burnt offering, Moses told them to eat the remainder of the meal offering. This indicates that the judging and correcting God continues to be merciful. </p>
<p data-content-id="5c5lLvOTxKbegnfVCkujIZCYwiZ6N8xQJy4GzCHBtPSGykqXudXnQpZPgRpmmqveb"> The meal offering, which was most holy, was to be eaten in a holy place, that is, in a place where God is. This means that the meal offering was to be eaten in God’s presence. Furthermore, it was to be eaten beside the cross (the altar). Without the cross we have no position to enjoy anything of Christ. Also, the meal offering was to be eaten without sin (unleavened) as an offering that could be accepted by God in the fire of His holiness. <span class="pg" data-page-id="297" id="297">[297]</span> </p>

This signifies that we, the New Testament priests, share with God some aspects of Christ as the believers’ peace offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="huE1la_VvhqT-E_rMeCC-1ozCtVrXjHXdPzx2sbNshy0olh7DO3UOWL5zObECuN3-"> The breast of the wave offering signifies the loving capacity of Christ in His resurrection. Christ has the particular capacity to love with God’s love. His loving capacity is not in the natural life but in resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="Uy7vFEnwR55XavTnTo3EqFJe7pHwHdfDirVdCYDVpVTdtZKnpVBJGlLm1pEB8cOAx"> The thigh of the heave offering signifies Christ’s strengthening power in His ascension. The strongest parts of our physical body are the thighs. They have not only the standing power but also the strengthening power. Today Christ is strengthening us in His ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="MPOCDFUKm8cVcjpGd7ROS35u83MKUGrsW0PImFA2Wzbc3DwzZLz1gDLcK7CSHAOA3"> The breast and the thigh were to be eaten in a clean place, signifying a clean condition apart from sin or any negative thing.

This signifies that we, the New Testament priests, partake of Christ as the believers’ sin offering. This partaking is in the sense of participating in Christ’s life, the life that bears others’ sins, as our life supply, that we may be able to bear the problems of God’s people. We partake of this offering in the church life in order to minister Christ’s sin-dealing life to the believers that they may deal with their sins. The goal of such a dealing is to appease the situation of the believers with God and to restore their broken fellowship with God. </p>

The word <em>expiation</em> in the Old Testament does not refer to the redemption accomplished and completed by Christ. Rather, expiation in the Old Testament is a type pointing to the redemption of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="9XfKmc-D9mR_l4j2zl61bRPPX4yLE1EyjHCSkford0o6f2fHKljszhGKeM9npgLuc"> The Hebrew word translated “make expiation” is <em>kaphar,</em> which means “to cover.” The noun form of this word is rendered “expiation cover” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39320" data-verses="Leviticus 16:2">16:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39321" data-verses="Leviticus 16:13-15">13-15</span>, and refers to the lid of the ark of the testimony. When someone came to contact God, immediately the Ten Commandments within the ark in the Holy of Holies exposed his sinful condition, indicating that there was a problem between this sinful person and the righteous God. Thus, there was no peace between these two parties. However, the blood of the sin offering was sprinkled upon the lid that covered the ark, signifying that the sin of the one coming to contact God had been covered. </p>
<p data-content-id="j-jDcdhlkFZU8qlJLAj5ysD8pqYt4hfT2n3xMNxM3nxLGWTONa1r1tuZp-L9a064x"> In the Old Testament time Christ had not yet come, but there was a type pointing to Christ. That type was the animal sacrifice which was offered to God as a sin offering. On the Day of Expiation the animal was slain, and its shed blood was brought into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled on the lid of the ark. In this way the problem between God and man was covered but not settled. This covering temporarily satisfied God’s requirement. This is to make expiation, to appease, to do something for the owing party to satisfy the requiring party, producing peace between the two parties. </p>

In this way Christ found, obtained, procured, redemption. Redemption was accomplished by Christ on the cross, and it was obtained by Christ the Redeemer from the hand of the redeeming God. What we receive today is not merely expiation or some kind of appeasing but the accomplished and completed redemption. Now we are enjoying such a redemption. </p>

For example, Leviticus often speaks of the high priest. No other New Testament book speaks as much about Christ as the High Priest than the book of Hebrews does. </p>
<p data-content-id="cEGQRZcEFdiSW_luPEGi_zuPj8CuWnBiAywbXPclmSQESewfF2_kdR7dnAPblMLTy"> In the book of Leviticus itself we cannot see how great, excellent, wonderful, all-inclusive, and inexhaustible is the Christ whom we offer and enjoy as the offerings. In Leviticus we can see that all the offerings typify Christ, but we do not get the realization and the sense of how great Christ is. No word can express the greatness of the Christ who is all the offerings. </p>
<p data-content-id="YDsRD7ifPw-lp8lc5xue-rehzPbtGOgMuQ4KkOc2H7hurUt1fU4NGccyn3CnOpDOB"> For a revelation of the all-inclusiveness of Christ, we need to come to the book of Hebrews. Let us now briefly survey the aspects of Christ revealed in Hebrews. </p>

The effulgence of God’s glory is like the shining or brightness of the light of the sun. Christ is the shining, the brightness, of the Father’s glory.

As the High Priest, Christ is the One who went back to God from us and with us. As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us that we may partake of the divine life, nature, and fullness. As the High Priest, Christ went to God with us to present us to God that we and all our case may be fully cared for by Him. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39354" data-verses="Hebrews 4:14-15">4:14 and 15</span> say, “Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession. For we do not have a high priest who is not able to sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tried in all respects like us, yet without sin.” As such a High Priest, Christ bears us in the presence of God and cares for all our needs. <span class="pg" data-page-id="305" id="305">[305]</span> </p>

In this verse Christ is the surety of a better covenant. Christ’s being the surety of a better covenant is based on His being the living and perpetual High Priest. The word <em>surety</em> here means that Christ has pledged Himself to the new covenant and to all of us. He is the bondsman, the guarantee that He will do everything necessary for the fulfillment of the new covenant. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="BbO8eSfTx5R84H_f9kv8JKRdiG3f2cqg7Rva48wPNAlxcvoNCVQHbME6iRkopNA5y">The High Priest Who Is<br/>Able to Save Us to the Uttermost</h2><p data-content-id="xpuW_vPofBGDzDc22724t8RGd5jrQ0BSr8301X99RY97AKbZvApQctIkumW21xaSQ"> “Wherefore also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, seeing He is always living to intercede for them.

Christ as our High Priest undertakes our case by interceding for us. He appears before God on our behalf, praying for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God’s eternal purpose. </p>

The heavenly Christ is ministering in a tabernacle pitched by the Lord and not by man. This tabernacle, this sanctuary, is in the third heaven, in which is the heavenly Holy of Holies. Christ, as a Minister of the true (heavenly) tabernacle, ministers heaven (which is not only a place but a condition of life) into us, so that we may live a heavenly life on earth as He did while He was here. </p>

Through this, Christ “found an eternal redemption.” Here the word <em>found</em> really means obtained, procured. By sprinkling His blood in the heavens before God, Christ has found, obtained, procured, eternal redemption for us. </p>

<p data-content-id="5c5lLvOTxKbegnfVCkujIZCYyiZrE8xQJy4GzCHBtPSGykqXudXnQpZPgRpmmqveb"> The book of Leviticus may be divided into two main sections. The first section, comprising <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39390" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">chapters one through ten</span>, covers the offerings and the priesthood. The second section, comprising <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39391" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">chapters eleven through twenty-seven</span>, covers the holy living of God’s holy people. After God speaks in the first section concerning the offerings and the priesthood, He speaks in the second section concerning His people in their entirety. The priests are not the only ones who should have a holy life and a holy living. The people of God, among whom the priests serve, should also be holy. </p>
<p data-content-id="N1UwjLbqomFsD8Hs1MzRwX7k3_D77gZu-SP6P-yYnxUULR5dEvstQRid9lxUvJo_Y"> Leviticus is a book of types, a book of typology. In the first seven chapters we have the different kinds of offerings, all of which are types. The priesthood in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39392" data-verses="Leviticus 8:1">chapters eight through ten</span> should also be considered a type. Furthermore, all the matters in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39393" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">chapters eleven through twenty-seven</span> concerning the holy living of God’s holy people should also be regarded as types. These chapters cover the living of the Israelites, God’s people in the Old Testament. However, if we have the proper understanding of the types, we shall realize that all the types in these chapters are types of the living of the New Testament believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="tq7hKR37puDvUqPzDeSKSsL2kC_2BUnOB1sQ10OAzaUm598D1pDdUeNiY98sV6D5J"> Because Leviticus is a book of types, there is the need for it to be expounded. Without the proper expounding, it is difficult for anyone to know this book. Nevertheless, some have claimed that there is no need for the exposition of the Bible. According to their concept, if we do not understand a certain portion of the Word the first time we read it, we should read it again and again until we do understand it. <span class="pg" data-page-id="312" id="312">[312]</span> However, this is not true of a book like Leviticus. I assure you, even if you were to read Leviticus hundreds of times, you would still be unable to understand it. If we are to know this book, it must be opened to us through the proper expounding. </p>
<p data-content-id="huE1la_VvhqT-E_rMeCC-1ozAtVObjHXdPzx2sbNshy0olh7DO3UOWL5zObECuN3-"> The book of Leviticus has been opened by God’s people collectively. It has been opened by God’s people for God’s people. This opening began with the Apostle Paul, who expounded Leviticus while writing the Epistle to the Hebrews. Peter also received some understanding of Leviticus through the vision given to him in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39394" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span>. The vision of a “certain vessel like a great sheet” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39395" data-verses="Acts 10:11">v. 11</span>) in which were all kinds of animals was a fulfillment of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39396" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">Leviticus 11</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39397" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span>, therefore, is an exposition of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39398" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">Leviticus 11</span>. From this we see that the expounding of the book of Leviticus began with the apostles. </p>
<p data-content-id="Uy7vFEnwR55XavTnTo3EqFJe5pHRKdfDirVdCYDVpVTdtZKnpVBJGlLm1pEB8cOAx"> This expounding has continued throughout the centuries, and now we are standing on the shoulders of the expositors who have preceded us. In particular, we are indebted to the Brethren, who were raised up by the Lord in England a century and a half ago. After I was saved, I was with the Brethren for seven and a half years. During those years, I learned much from them concerning typology and prophecy. The Brethren teachers had a lot to say about the animals in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39399" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">Leviticus 11</span>. Without the help I received from the Brethren, I could not understand what is covered in this chapter. Just as I am standing on the shoulders of the Brethren, you are standing on my shoulders. I hope that in the years to come you who are standing on my shoulders will see more than I have seen. </p>
<p data-content-id="MPOCDFUKm8cVcjpGd7ROS35u-3MKcGrsW0PImFA2Wzbc3DwzZLz1gDLcK7CSHAOA3"> Since the book of Leviticus is written fully in types, certain points are very difficult to understand. One extremely difficult point is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39400" data-verses="Leviticus 11:3">11:3a</span>, which speaks of whatever “divides the hoof and is cloven-footed.” Here we have two matters: dividing the hoof and being cloven-footed. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39401" data-verses="Leviticus 11:7">verse 7</span> we are told that the pig divides the hoof and is cloven-footed. What is the difference between these two things? I do not know. The Chinese version of the Bible makes dividing the <span class="pg" data-page-id="313" id="313">[313]</span> hoof and being cloven-footed into one thing. In other words, the scholars who prepared that translation thought that to divide the hoof was to be cloven-footed. The difference between dividing the hoof and being cloven-footed requires further study. </p>
<p data-content-id="V7B55sygWuttI4KoZ4bOSqhkwH8YVc2BybMHU3NWuBbXmv0xQiUlyWnEa-JNV4Dll"> The title of this message is “Discernment in Diet.” Discernment in diet is a matter of discernment in food-stuffs, of discernment in what we eat. Eating is not a great thing. Why, then, must we take care of our eating if we are to live a holy life? In order to answer this question, we need to remember that Leviticus is a book of types, and in types there are figures which bear a particular significance. The significance is different from the thing itself. This is true of the animals mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39402" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">Leviticus 11</span>. All these animals bear a great significance, for they typify persons; they are figures that describe different kinds of persons. This is proved by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39403" data-verses="Acts 10:9-14">Acts 10:9b-14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39404" data-verses="Acts 10:27-29">27-29</span>. Peter “beheld heaven opened, and a certain vessel like a great sheet descending, being let down by four corners onto the earth, in which were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of the heaven” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39405" data-verses="Acts 10:11-12">vv. 11-12</span>). At first, Peter did not understand that these animals, reptiles, and birds were figures of people. Eventually he came to understand this, for in the house of Cornelius there were people, not beasts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39406" data-verses="Acts 10:27-28">vv. 27-28</span>). </p>

This especially refers to our contacting of people. When we eat we contact something that is outside of us, something that has nothing to do with us. However, if we eat that thing, it can affect us inside. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39408" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">Leviticus 11</span> the <span class="pg" data-page-id="314" id="314">[314]</span> things we eat signify people, and eating signifies our contacting of people. </p>

Once a thing is received into us, that thing can be digested inside to become our constituent, that is, our being, our constitution. We all are a constitution of the food we eat and digest. Eventually, what we digest becomes us; it becomes our very constitution. This indicates that contacting people is an important matter. If we intend to live a holy life as required by the holy God, we need to be careful about our contact with people. Our contact with certain kinds of people can cause us to be reconstituted and thus make us another kind of person. Whatever we contact we will receive, and whatever we receive will reconstitute us, making us a different kind of person from what we are now. </p>

All creeping things are unclean, but in the other four categories some animals are clean and others are unclean. Let us now consider the four categories of living creatures that are clean with respect to diet. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="sA3DT0shgAyQDQA-p8ePSMOFYDArFm6lmg0vdxCAVblltDJck0V84lLYhSpuxHAEb">A. Beasts That Divide the Hoof<br/>and Chew the Cud</h2><p data-content-id="wC5_UtyIRPyB7WpxJOJXBMKCBb96ACN8AU3cnMbGoPMp8MiDs1CTFLNSZcpsTXlfK"> Beasts that divide the hoof and chew the cud (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39410" data-verses="Leviticus 11:2-3">vv. 2-3</span>) signify persons who have discernment in their activities and who receive the word of God with much reconsideration. A divided hoof signifies discernment. A horse has whole hooves, not divided hooves. Hence, a horse signifies a person <span class="pg" data-page-id="315" id="315">[315]</span> who does not have the power, the strength, to discern things. Such a person cannot discern what things are of God and what things are of Satan, what things are heavenly and what things are earthly, what things are spiritual and what things are fleshly. We need to discern not only what is good and what is bad but also what is of our spirit and what is of our flesh, as well as what things are of the new man and what things are of the old man. </p>

<p data-content-id="j-jDcdhlkFZU8qlJLAj5ysD8qqYwxhfT2n3xMNxM3nxLGWTONa1r1tuZp-L9a064x"> We have seen that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39437" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">chapter eleven</span> of Leviticus is concerned with the matter of diet, with the matter of eating. Now we need to see that this chapter is also very much concerned with death. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39438" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">Leviticus 11</span> the word “carcass” is used at least thirteen times, and the word “dead” is used twice. Without death, there could not be any carcasses. A carcass actually denotes death. As long as there is a carcass, there is death. </p>
<p data-content-id="TofT8HtRPh84NluTshenNJ4C9klIg9GX-6GWVXNVjM-AbkkrSnjYFGJ4XZJr1H9Yt"> The fact that this chapter speaks of death in relation to diet indicates that our diet, our eating, is a matter of life or death. If we contact clean things, we get life. But if we contact unclean things, we get death. </p>
<p data-content-id="nRN-9RpWzYzdXhr-0W84uWhfRzvj5XUyMyOADopoPOVCtb3FQHmSh9OGRIQ_-D705"> In this chapter the words “abomination” and “detestable” also refer to uncleanness. We should detest uncleanness, hate it to the uttermost, because it brings us death. Whenever we touch something that is unclean, we touch death. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39439" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">Leviticus 11</span> uncleanness is synonymous with death. Where there is uncleanness, there is death. Moreover, death consummates in a carcass. The carcasses even of the clean living creatures are unclean (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39440" data-verses="Leviticus 11:39-40">vv. 39-40</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="67dOgBo1e70S3A3lNxA9FxxxN41LJ2q9yYLlBn7LhMEcWP1VC14MaUjBJJcP9KtDT"> Death is an ugly, abominable thing. Therefore, we need to abstain from death. Apparently <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39441" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">chapter eleven</span> speaks of abstaining from uncleanness; actually this chapter tells us to abstain from death. The death from which we should abstain is not mainly physical death but spiritual death. Spiritual death is more prevailing on earth than physical death. Spiritual death is everywhere. Not only sinful, worldly places but even the most moral, ethical places are <span class="pg" data-page-id="322" id="322">[322]</span> full of spiritual death. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39442" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">Chapter eleven</span> of Leviticus warns us to abstain from spiritual death. </p>
<p data-content-id="R36y4VgO7wqhNpNxDLl0OIeLzl1T5MnHC79X_ufmE0Wna47bAcYxxGOhmnV68pR00"> As a help to understanding what spiritual death is, let us consider the significance of the two trees in the garden of Eden—the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. </p>
<p data-content-id="8CNj27OFWN_6qC9vAuBiiMutLbkReYeypGMeEZeM8id7MXFWLRMGZ4VnbbcHB5Ro8"> After God created man, He placed him before these two trees (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39443" data-verses="Genesis 2:8-9">Gen. 2:8-9</span>). The tree of life is simply, singly, purely, and absolutely of life. With this tree there are no complications. Instead, there is only one thing—life. The man created by God was thus in a situation where he was facing the tree of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="0Mc2AjIjEcgnOIfYqSBXyGYbhncMnEwKUmlwVwYbl9P2sUtxfBsUTcI2aw4ETTmDP"> In the Bible, God is signified, or illustrated, by a tree (e.g. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39444" data-verses="Hosea 14:8">Hosea 14:8</span>). When God became incarnated and lived on earth, He said of Himself, “I am the vine” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39445" data-verses="John 15:5">John 15:5a</span>). A vine grows by spreading and for this reason it is available to us. A pine, on the contrary, grows upward. We cannot reach the top of a fully-grown pine tree, but we easily have access to a vine. I am glad that the Lord said not that He was a pine but that He was a vine. Our God is high, yet He lowered Himself to become a vine, spreading Himself to reach the four corners of the earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="7KDrIgxvPeGxEknpu13p9NRVnL23CvFquTAbQrYdftQwur0W0NCp1o6e3TlKTMR6I"> This vine is the tree of life. We can prove this by putting <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39446" data-verses="John 15:5">John 15:5a</span> together with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39447" data-verses="John 14:6">John 14:6a</span>, where the Lord says, “I am the life.” On the one hand, He is the vine, a tree; on the other hand, He is life. Therefore, He is the tree of life. Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, is the tree of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="_WsCu0UVGd8o3Q6ZANIAJepVhWd9K7Zx5OwRVVx1PunU7kpT6WA8gEA6LgK96lE05"> The Bible not only begins with the tree of life in Genesis but also consummates with the tree of life in Revelation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39448" data-verses="Revelation 22:2">Revelation 22:2a</span> says, “On this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39449" data-verses="Revelation 22:14">Verse 14</span> of that chapter goes on to say, “Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life.” These verses speak of the tree of life in the New Jerusalem. What about today? In the church life today we may enjoy Christ as the tree of life. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39450" data-verses="Revelation 2:7">Revelation 2:7</span>, the Lord has promised Himself to us as the tree of life for our enjoyment. “To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in <span class="pg" data-page-id="323" id="323">[323]</span> the paradise of God.” Today’s church life is a prefigure, a miniature, of the New Jerusalem, which is the paradise of God. In a very real sense, therefore, in the church life we are in the paradise of God enjoying Christ as our tree of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="BbO8eSfTx5R84H_f9kv8JKRdgG3Twcqg7Rva48wPNAlxcvoNCVQHbME6iRkopNA5y"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39451" data-verses="Hosea 14:8">Hosea 14:8</span> the Lord likens Himself to an evergreen tree. He is not only the tree of life—He is also the evergreen. As the tree of life, He is ever green. </p>
<p data-content-id="xpuW_vPofBGDzDc22724t8RGf5jnW0BSr8301X99RY97AKbZvApQctIkumW21xaSQ"> In the garden of Eden there was not only the tree of life but also the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The tree of life signifies God Himself as the totality and source of life. When God placed Adam in the garden, He knew that in this universe there was also another source—God’s enemy, Satan. There is not only one source—God as the source of life; there is also a second source—Satan as the source of death. Just as God is the totality and source of life, Satan is the totality and source of death. Therefore, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies death. </p>
<p data-content-id="rCeQBKNuXLnpxNKjpL-6rcvuWmEO5HB5ztp7_KErmZE1m7T-GugDdoJ0xk-AO9IMP"> Whereas life is pure and single, death is complicated. The tree that signifies death is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Here we have three things which make death a complicated matter: knowledge, good, and evil. Since knowledge is related to death, the more knowledge we have, the more we are involved with death. Likewise, good is involved not with life but with death. Evil, of course, is an element of death. We all count evil with death, but we may count knowledge and good with life. In the Bible, however, life stands by itself, but both knowledge and good go with death. Eventually, knowledge, good, and evil all consummate in death. </p>
<p data-content-id="dUhqhQwKWbXKSbqvLKXmrZOfp6OXK9A-m0V4pRJtqQPpDGovAqJWJcKK1hwOATnaE"> In order to live a holy life, we need to abstain from anything that belongs to death. In particular, we need to abstain from the common practice of gossiping. Those who have the habit of gossiping may pretend to be concerned about others and their situation. Actually, due to their habit of gossiping, they are merely seeking more knowledge for the purpose of gossiping. The source of the habit of gossiping is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. </p>
<p data-content-id="QrptJJxnlubdylPzgsOm36qgH-PH6LPyv1OlLurgtE73Y3Ur-McK8L5I1R7Ma9Rtr"> Through Adam’s fall this tree has been implanted into us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="324" id="324">[324]</span> Even though we have been saved and have had God as the tree of life planted into our being, we still have the tree of the knowledge of good and evil within us. This means that each of us is a miniature garden of Eden. We have God within us as the tree of life and also Satan as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. </p>
<p data-content-id="Kbr2zMFu7prMv589VrFoje5GM-W_WbKZ7yQ9bjy8JdXHTAd4mjuWZo9eiEivMyu1q"> Gossiping has nothing to do with the tree of life, for gossiping never imparts life to the listeners. To gossip is to be involved with death; it is to spread death, which is of God’s enemy, to others. To abstain from gossip is to abstain from death. If we would live a holy life, a life that abstains from anything related to death, we must stay away from the source of death; that is, we must stay away from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. </p>

If we do not have the right concept concerning death, it will not be easy for us to realize that death is more defiling than sin. Because of our ethical and moral concepts, we know that lying is sinful. If someone lies to us, we shall condemn that lie as sinful. However, we may not realize that talk which is ethical may nevertheless be filled with death. For example, we may not realize talking with a brother about his family may involve death. Such talk may be ethical but still be filled with death. </p>

Suppose a brother gives a book to another brother with the intention of pleasing him. Even such a good thing may be filled with death. We should give something to a brother not with the purpose of pleasing him but simply because we are following <span class="pg" data-page-id="325" id="325">[325]</span> the Lord’s leading. It is political to have a purpose, an intention, when we give something to a brother. </p>

This signifies that the male (representing the strong ones) is fully (signified by the seven days) unclean in spite of his strength, and that the female (representing the weak ones) is doubly (signified by the fourteen days) unclean in her weakness. This shows us that the females are twice as unclean as the males. The numbers seven and fourteen indicate this. Seven is the number of fullness, and fourteen is two times seven. The “seven days” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39500" data-verses="Leviticus 12:2">verse 2</span> signify fully unclean, unclean in full, and the “two weeks” (fourteen days) in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39501" data-verses="Leviticus 12:5">verse 5a</span> signify twice this uncleanness. </p>

This signifies that the uncleanness of a male’s birth should be tested (signified by the forty days—seven days plus thirty-three days) for cleanness, and that the uncleanness of a female’s birth should be doubly tested (signified by the eighty days—fourteen days plus sixty-six days) for cleanness. In the Bible the number forty denotes a period of testing. The children of Israel wandered in the wilderness for forty years, and the Lord Jesus was tempted, that is, tested, for forty days. Because the birth of a human being is altogether unclean, it required a test for cleanness. The birth of a male <span class="pg" data-page-id="334" id="334">[334]</span> was tested for forty days, and the birth of a female was doubly tested for eighty days. </p>

This signifies that the flesh of the unclean person should be put aside through the death of Christ that he might be brought into the resurrection of Christ, not only to be cleansed but also to have a new beginning of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39506" data-verses="Colossians 2:11-12">Col. 2:11-12</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="HomP821jsfmQ8p43kMxD4q8mb34vmTThflkEC69_mme9_M6bdRalURihY94i1Wws0"> After a week of seven days, there is the eighth day. The eighth day is a new start, the start of a new week. In the Bible the eighth day refers to Christ’s resurrection. Resurrection, of course, is a new start. Death ends the old course, and resurrection begins a new course and is therefore a new start. </p>
<p data-content-id="XgZNVEXVlLg7OJdTmWIsMv5Y_E3suo8X5u0Ynp1K0k7DMJm_eLaooWZ29TKHlzJPK"> As Christians, we have had two starts. We had the first start when we were born in uncleanness and into uncleanness. We were born to be uncleanness. In nationality we may be different, but in our real being we are all the same. Every human being, regardless of race, is born uncleanness. This was our first start. </p>
<p data-content-id="k1b_-LdFaDzH5eTjPaqBvcmDiKHQnaDHUrgPD1q4xSXGU2fRRcrs_GWJkW-01a5uN"> According to God’s plan, God’s economy, He has made a way for us to have a second start, a new start. God counts in weeks. The end of a week is the end of a course, which is followed by a new course. Our new course is not in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="335" id="335">[335]</span> original creation but in resurrection. We were born in the old creation, but we were reborn a new creation. In the first start, we were in the category of the old creation, which is signified by seven days. In God’s economy, the course of human life is seven days. After being born into the old creation, we stayed there for just seven days. Then on the eighth day, the day of Christ’s resurrection, we had a new start. </p>
<p data-content-id="JYgdOTAphL2MixIdDMe3gVg3uZqlNUwH83TVGMXXC5x0rPf1TViep-9RX2Pq_QKeG"> We should be full of joy whenever we come across the words “the eighth day” or “the first day of the week” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39507" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39508" data-verses="John 20:19">19</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39509" data-verses="John 20:26">26</span>) in our reading of the Bible. Today, as believers in Christ, we are not in the first seven days—we are in the eighth day. We are in the second course. This course is eternal, for in Christ we shall live forever. The Lord Jesus said, “Everyone who lives and believes in Me shall by no means die forever” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39510" data-verses="John 11:26">John 11:26</span>). Whereas our second course is eternal, our first course is very short, only seven days. Whether we are saved early in life or at an advanced age, in the sight of God our first course is only a week in length. God in His economy has shortened our first course, but He has prolonged our second course, even making it eternal just as He Himself is eternal. </p>

Actually, our entire being should be circumcised, cut off. For our whole being to be circumcised is for it to be put to death. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39529" data-verses="Leviticus 12:1">chapter twelve</span> we see that human birth involves uncleanness, for we were born uncleanness.

<p data-content-id="HomP821jsfmQ8p43kMxD4q8ma346lTThflkEC69_mme9_M6bdRalURihY94i1Wws0"> Discernment in diet concerns what we should contact outwardly and what we should receive from the outside. Our birth in uncleanness, on the contrary, concerns not what we contact outwardly but what we are inwardly. We are uncleanness by birth. This uncleanness is something within us. We were born sinners. We did not become sinners by doing something sinful or by receiving something from outside of us that caused us to be changed in our disposition or in our constitution. No, we are sinners by birth. Whether we contact something clean or unclean, we are still sinners. Being a sinner has nothing to do with what we contact outwardly; rather, being a sinner is a matter of our birth. </p>
<p data-content-id="XgZNVEXVlLg7OJdTmWIsMv5Y-E3Bko8X5u0Ynp1K0k7DMJm_eLaooWZ29TKHlzJPK"> It is difficult to analyze leprosy. We may say that leprosy originates from outside a person, that it is caused by the entering into a person of the germs of leprosy. We may also say that leprosy comes from within, since a person cannot develop leprosy unless the element of leprosy enters into his being to give rise to this disease. Leprosy, therefore, comprises both an outside factor and an inward effect. The cause is from the outside, but the effect is inward. </p>
<p data-content-id="k1b_-LdFaDzH5eTjPaqBvcmDjKH5saDHUrgPD1q4xSXGU2fRRcrs_GWJkW-01a5uN"> We need to consider three things: discernment in diet, human birth with its uncleanness, and leprosy. These three <span class="pg" data-page-id="340" id="340">[340]</span> matters cover all our problems, and our living of a holy life has much to do with them. We need to ask ourselves about what we contact, about our birth, and about leprosy with its outward factor and inward effect. If we cannot solve the problems we have related to these things, it will be impossible for us to live a holy life. How can we live a holy life if we contact the wrong things, if we are persons born uncleanness, and if we are subject to an outward factor and an inward effect that make us leprous? It would be impossible. Can a leper live a holy life? Certainly not! In order to live a holy life, we must deal with our contact with things, with our birth, and with our leprous condition. </p>

According to this regulation, the king could not participate in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="341" id="341">[341]</span> priesthood. But Uzziah rebelled against this regulation, and as a result of his rebellion he became leprous. In each of these three cases, the leprosy first entered into the rebellious one and then issued from within that one. </p>
<p data-content-id="3lBTmaq9moHRumeUlLI0z9-5Xbb9MhxeMZAEbbLWdHR7eQxL9TMP84tRESuFndxAt"> According to the Old Testament, leprosy is the outcome of a certain cause, and that cause is rebellion against God’s authority, against God’s deputy authority, against God’s regulation, and against God’s economy. We all must admit that we have rebelled against God’s authority and against His deputy authority. Furthermore, we have often rebelled against God’s regulation. Finally, we have also rebelled against God’s entire economy. Therefore, in God’s eyes we all became leprous. Leprosy entered into us and then issued forth from within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="G8WifseOG75eXksZ0Xg3wn7EQetEF8YfLcO9OTK3bDlF2oEvqaaac2VQzRzH11-xg"> Leprosy is sin. In the Bible the first case of sin was Satan’s rebellion. Satan rebelled against God, and that rebellion became the sin that is now in the universe. Before Satan’s rebellion there was not such a thing as sin. Sin was invented, not created, by the rebellious archangel Lucifer. </p>
<p data-content-id="cEGQRZcEFdiSW_luPEGi_zuPv8CLUnBiAywbXPclmSQESewfF2_kdR7dnAPblMLTy"> Sin is actually leprosy. The denotation of sin in the biblical sense is rebellion. Sin, therefore, is rebellion against God, against God’s representative, or deputy, authority, and against God’s plan, arrangement, government, and administration. As a whole, sin is rebellion against God’s economy. This rebellion was invented, inaugurated, by Satan himself. Eventually, sin came into mankind. “Through one man sin entered into the world” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39539" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Rom. 5:12a</span>). Having entered into man, this sin, this leprosy, now issues from within man. As a result, we are leprous. Whenever we do something against God, that thing is leprous. From this we can see that sin is a matter of leprosy. Leprosy signifies sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="YDsRD7ifPw-lp8lc5xue-reh_PbMFOgMuQ4KkOc2H7hurUt1fU4NGccyn3CnOpDOB"> When the Lord Jesus came down from the mountain where He decreed the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, the first thing He did was cleanse a leper (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39540" data-verses="Matthew 8:1-4">Matt. 8:1-4</span>). This leper represents the fallen descendants of Adam, all of whom are lepers. The sin that was invented by Satan entered into mankind through Adam and made us all lepers. <span class="pg" data-page-id="342" id="342">[342]</span> Leprosy now issues in many different kinds of sins, that is, in many expressions, manifestations, of rebellion. </p>

Swellings, eruptions, and bright spots on the skin of one’s flesh are signs of leprosy. Spiritually speaking, these indicate unruliness, lawlessness. Unruliness is a kind of eruption. An unruly person is one who is not under any ruling. </p>

It would not be adequate to say that dignity is a kind of honor. Dignity is actually self-assumed honor. A person of high social standing may be honored by others.

Spiritually speaking, if we are strong in our spirit to live a proper and normal Christian life, we shall have black hair. But if our hair becomes yellow and thin, that is a sign that our spiritual strength is deteriorating. Yellow thin hair is a sign of disease, and this disease comes from rebellion. Such hair is a sign of rebellion against God; it indicates that, at least in certain things, one is not submissive or obedient to God’s word. Even the slightest disobedience to God’s word in the Bible will cause our hair to become yellow and thin. </p>

This signifies that a person’s sin is not covered and that he does not have the strength to resist it. For the disease not to be deeper than the skin is a positive sign; it indicates that a person’s sin is not covered, that he does not have the tendency to cover his sin. There being no black hair is a negative sign; it indicates that the strength to resist sin is lacking. Actually, the situation described in this verse is neutral, and for this reason the priest was required to isolate the diseased person for seven days. </p>

Suppose a garment belonging to a certain Israelite suddenly became greenish or reddish. That would be an abnormal change in the appearance of the garment. Such a change typifies an abnormal change in our behavior. Our daily living and conduct should be normal. However, a person’s conduct may change in a way that is abnormal and strange. This is a sign of disease, a sign of leprosy. </p>

The words “malignant” and “fretting” indicate a disease that spreads by eating the flesh. Such a malignant leprosy signifies sin that is spreading within a person by eating up his being. At the beginning, the sin may be very small in scale and very low in degree. Now, however, the sin is spreading by devouring the person, becoming worse and worse in its malignancy. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="nRN-9RpWzYzdXhr-0W84uWhDXzv26XUyMyOADopoPOVCtb3FQHmSh9OGRIQ_-D705">E. Burning the Garment in Fire</h2><p data-content-id="67dOgBo1e70S3A3lNxA9FxxtL41mD2q9yYLlBn7LhMEcWP1VC14MaUjBJJcP9KtDT"> “He shall burn the garment, whether diseased in woven or knitted material, in wool or in linen, or any article of leather, for it is a malignant leprosy; it shall be burned in the fire” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39593" data-verses="Leviticus 13:52">v. 52</span>). Burning the garment in fire signifies eliminating the sinful and filthy living and conduct. When we discover that something sinful in us is becoming worse and worse, we should eliminate that thing by “burning” it, that is, by dealing with it by the cross of Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="360" id="360">[360]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="R36y4VgO7wqhNpNxDLl0OIeX1l16yMnHC79X_ufmE0Wna47bAcYxxGOhmnV68pR00">F.

Sometimes instead of such a strong dealing, we need another kind of dealing—the dealing signified by washing a garment. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39594" data-verses="Leviticus 13:53-54">verses 53 and 54</span> say, “But if the priest examines it, and the disease has not spread in the garment, in woven or knitted material, or in any article of leather, then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which the disease is, and he shall isolate it another seven days.” Washing the garment, the disease of which has not spread, signifies dealing with the suspected weakness in one’s living and conduct. It may not be clear whether a certain thing is a real sin or a suspected sin. In such a case it is sufficient to wash the garment. This is to deal with a matter by the washing Spirit of God, who is likened to water for washing. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="wC5_UtyIRPyB7WpxJOJXBMKeGb9-CCN8AU3cnMbGoPMp8MiDs1CTFLNSZcpsTXlfK">G. A Rotting, a Deeper Fretting Leprosy</h2><p data-content-id="LN8LqFsPX2mirpNVn3_Fl_NkNEwlfzowX3QYUfdcNcHOHUZ6TUtCG5uztkJS3CHT0"> “After it has been washed the priest shall again examine the diseased article and if the diseased spot has not changed its appearance, though the disease has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it with fire; it is a rotting, whether on its inside or on its outside” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39595" data-verses="Leviticus 13:55">v. 55</span>). A rotting, a deeper fretting leprosy is very serious; it signifies the corroding sin that is becoming worse and deeper, having no change in appearance through repentance and confession. This is the kind of sin that can take over a person, devouring him and swallowing him up. </p>
<p data-content-id="mqLFmiP5_8OCpZzE87Nge8sUjJONTmqJWkZYIFBzM8DlynnVp33_qIBdunbYlLH9U"> In our Christian life we daily need two things—repentance and confession. A day without repentance and confession is not a good day. Just as we need to wash our hands again and again, we need to repent and confess again and again. Every day we have things to repent of and confess. If we would live a holy life we need a daily washing, and this washing comes through our repentance and confession. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZFdhXfV0GtQ7ozQy5uEoF65_16rsIlqjdVAMW6C4PfTWSUVAOgHKQM3Y0B8x6f0De"> We need to repent and confess in our married life and our family life. In our married life we should be willing to say to our spouse that we are sorry. If we are not willing to say that <span class="pg" data-page-id="361" id="361">[361]</span> we are sorry, we shall have problems with our husband or wife. In our family life the parents should be willing, when they have offended their children, to tell them that they are sorry. The word “sorry” implies repentance and confession. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX99LAoSSDDp0sZ8GP9dslCihGo0sDOOXlVaDXIcuoHkKGg7wn__7mL30AgWcce-r"> God’s forgiveness of His children has certain terms or conditions. The main condition is our confession (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39596" data-verses="1John 1:9">1 John 1:9</span>), and confession comes out of our repentance. We cannot confess unless we repent. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fv8eruG2C4An5ussdVnkAb4Ey9jxWBFRCDYUBaT7z4c3XGWu7IZmTcTRA2UgLmbJe"> In order to live a holy life, we need to know the things concerning discernment in diet, concerning our birth, and concerning our condition. After learning these things, we must come to realize our need of daily repentance. We need to repent because it is so easy for us to make mistakes. Furthermore, we need to repent of what issues from within us. We may use the cleansing of our physical body as an illustration. During the day our hands do not touch anything unclean. Nevertheless, we shall become unclean through what issues out from within us. For this reason, we need a daily washing. The principle is the same in our Christian life. Even if we do not contact anything unclean, we still need to repent of what issues from within our being. This means that we need to repent not only of what we do but of what we are. Remember, we are a totality of uncleanness. As such, we need daily repentance and confession. </p>

In the foregoing messages we saw a portrait of what we are in a negative way. This portrait exposes us to the uttermost, revealing what we are in ourselves. Now we come to the matter of cleansing, which is the all-inclusive salvation God has prepared and accomplished for us. Here we see a Christ who is all-inclusive. He has the blood, the Spirit, and everything we need to be cleansed. In Him we have the rich, complete, and extensive provision of God’s salvation. We all need to know this cleansing, this salvation, and experience it in full. </p>

He shall be brought to the priest” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39613" data-verses="Leviticus 14:2">Lev. 14:2</span>). The leper being brought to the priest signifies an unclean person being brought to the Lord. In preaching the gospel we are actually bringing unclean persons, sinners, to the Lord. </p>

The Lord came from the heavens to the earth in order to be nigh to us, the sinners. This is portrayed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39615" data-verses="Matthew 8:1">Matthew 8</span>. “When He had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed <span class="pg" data-page-id="366" id="366">[366]</span> Him. And behold, a leper approached and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me. And stretching out His hand, He touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39616" data-verses="Matthew 8:1-3">vv. 1-3</span>). This leper should have been isolated, excluded, from the people of God. He should not have been touched by others, lest the contagious disease be passed on to them. Nevertheless, having sympathy in love for the leper, the Lord Jesus came nigh to him and touched him. </p>

This signifies that the one who is sick of the sin of leprosy, although he has been healed by the life within, still needs to have his shortcomings and defilement dealt with before God that he might be cleansed. Cleansing from leprosy requires not only the action from God’s side but also the coordination from our side. As lepers, as sinners, we need to seek for cleansing. Our seeking is our cooperation with God’s grace and love. </p>
<p data-content-id="HomP821jsfmQ8p43kMxD4q86R34jsTThflkEC69_mme9_M6bdRalURihY94i1Wws0"> The one who had been healed of leprosy still needed to be cleansed.

Christ died on the cross to take away our sins. This is typified by the first bird. Christ rose from among the dead for us that we might be delivered from our weakness by the power, strength, and energy of life. This life is the resurrection life, life in resurrection. It is also the divine life, the eternal, uncreated life of God. We receive this life from the resurrected Christ, who is typified by the second bird.

The hyssop in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39623" data-verses="Leviticus 14:4">Leviticus 14:4b</span> signifies that the Lord was willing to be lowly in becoming in the likeness of men that He might be nigh to man and become man’s Savior. On <span class="pg" data-page-id="368" id="368">[368]</span> the one hand, as typified by cedar wood, the Lord has the highest standard of humanity; on the other hand, as typified by the hyssop, He was willing to be lowly that He might be available to us. </p>

With Scarlet</h2><p data-content-id="dUhqhQwKWbXKSbqvLKXmrZODs6ObE9A-m0V4pRJtqQPpDGovAqJWJcKK1hwOATnaE"> Scarlet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39624" data-verses="Leviticus 14:4">v. 4b</span>), a dark red color, implies much in typology. Scarlet here signifies that the Lord lowered Himself to become a man that He might do the will of God and shed His blood on the cross for our redemption, thus becoming the honorable and high King. The color scarlet signifies the shedding of blood. Thus it signifies Christ’s redemption accomplished by His shedding His blood on the cross. Scarlet also implies kingship. Christ was slain, crucified, for redemption and through that redemption He became the King. The Savior has become the King not by fighting but by dying, by being crucified. </p>

<p data-content-id="lo2rhE_cgAMwRI2ZJVIpYWqvzpSfh6e5Meoawkyfbmb_iVgZMNNND2h_d1VBdUhRD"> The earthen vessel signifies the Lord’s humanity, and the living water signifies the living and eternal Spirit of God. Over an earthen vessel filled with living water a bird was to be killed. This signifies that Christ was killed in His humanity filled with the living, eternal Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39627" data-verses="Hebrews 9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span> we have the fulfillment of this type. This verse tells us that Christ through the eternal Spirit offered Himself to God. When He was dying on the cross, He offered Himself to God through the living water—the eternal, living Spirit of <span class="pg" data-page-id="369" id="369">[369]</span> God—that filled Him. Christ was not alone when He was on the cross, for the eternal Spirit was in Him and with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="OETCsjMBdqbNfrPdG1o4GALTPHAwJO7bMBYHie8kfs2o1Fr5FqXL4WjAzs30TDaPr"> Without Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39628" data-verses="Hebrews 9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span> we could not understand the type in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39629" data-verses="Leviticus 14:5">Leviticus 14:5</span>. In the type a number of details are covered in a very simple way. Here we have an earthenware vessel, living water, and a bird that was slain. When we put this type together with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39630" data-verses="Hebrews 9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>, we see that when Christ (the slain bird) was being crucified, He was in His humanity (the earthenware vessel), yet within Him was the eternal Spirit, the living Spirit of God (the living water). Through the Spirit who filled Him, Christ offered Himself to God. </p>

<p class="scripture" data-content-id="V7B55sygWuttI4KoZ4bOSqh41H8Jec2BybMHU3NWuBbXmv0xQiUlyWnEa-JNV4Dll">Scripture Reading: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39639" data-verses="Leviticus 14:10-32">Lev. 14:10-32</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ivxFinYAwLQi2teoWLAO0sXEiaET38tRoutdjeTon_4zq6XLkUjUpOe_VDOm3Pn7t"> As New Testament believers, we enjoy the Lord’s cleansing. However, if we simply read and understand the New Testament, we shall not have a clear, detailed picture of what is involved in this cleansing. For this we need the types in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39640" data-verses="Leviticus 14:1">Leviticus 14</span>. From the types we see that to cleanse us of our leprosy the Lord had to be incarnated, to become a human being. As typified by the cedar wood, His humanity was high and honorable. As typified by the hyssop, He was willing to be lowly in becoming in the likeness of men. On the one hand, His standard was high; on the other hand, His status was very low. Both were for the producing of the scarlet thread. Furthermore, the two birds typify Christ in two other aspects, with the slain bird signifying Christ in His crucifixion and the live bird signifying Christ in His resurrection. Without Christ in all these aspects, we could not be cleansed of our leprosy, of our sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="187ceXh_NbRnYyu1mrKM_o0jYxjQsDgQKRD-2KHDg7OF95AMtokSZlUzK2LV54vgN"> I do not believe that the ancient Israelites understood the significance of the two birds, the cedar, the hyssop, the killing of one bird over an earthenware vessel filled with living water, binding together the live bird, the cedar, the hyssop, and the scarlet thread and dipping this bundle into the blood of the killed bird that this blood might be sprinkled seven times on the one who was to be cleansed. Although the Israelites saw these things and experienced them, they did not understand them. However, we today do understand these types. Now we can see that for our cleansing we need a Christ of many aspects, a Christ who has gone through a <span class="pg" data-page-id="376" id="376">[376]</span> number of processes. The blood shed by Him has been sprinkled upon us, and this sprinkling connects us, the sinners, to Christ, the Redeemer. </p>
<p data-content-id="9XfKmc-D9mR_l4j2zl61bRPTQ4yiM1EyjHCSkford0o6f2fHKljszhGKeM9npgLuc"> Although the Lord has shown us much concerning these types, we hope that in the coming years He will show us even more. </p>
<p data-content-id="j-jDcdhlkFZU8qlJLAj5ysDguqYAxhfT2n3xMNxM3nxLGWTONa1r1tuZp-L9a064x"> The previous message covered only the first part of the procedure, or the process, of the cleansing of a leper. In this message we shall cover the second part of this process. </p>
<p data-content-id="N1UwjLbqomFsD8Hs1MzRwX74y_DmxgZu-SP6P-yYnxUULR5dEvstQRid9lxUvJo_Y"> In the cleansing of the leper, Christ is revealed not only as the two birds, the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet thread but also as four kinds of offerings: the trespass offering, the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the meal offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="tq7hKR37puDvUqPzDeSKSsLqhC_vKUnOB1sQ10OAzaUm598D1pDdUeNiY98sV6D5J"> The sin offering deals with our sinful nature, with sin as the nature of our fallen being. The nature of our fallen being is sin, and this sinful nature is the essence, the substance, the element, of Satan. Our sinful nature—the sin in our being—is satanic. We may even say that it is Satan himself. Sin, which is rebellion, is Satan. This sin has been injected into us, causing us to be constituted sinners (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39641" data-verses="Romans 5:19">Rom. 5:19</span>), that is, sinners in constitution. Human beings, therefore, are a constitution of sin. We need to see that our being is fully constituted with sin, with the enemy of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="huE1la_VvhqT-E_rMeCC-1ovFtVrTjHXdPzx2sbNshy0olh7DO3UOWL5zObECuN3-"> The sin offering deals with our nature of sin. Sin is our nature; it is even our very self. When Christ died on the cross, He did not only die for our sins but was also made sin for us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39642" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">2 Cor. 5:21</span>). Christ was crucified as sin. When He was crucified, sin also was crucified, and we were crucified as well. When Christ was crucified as sin, sin, Satan, and we ourselves were crucified with Him. This is the significance of the sin offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="Uy7vFEnwR55XavTnTo3EqFJC8pHwDdfDirVdCYDVpVTdtZKnpVBJGlLm1pEB8cOAx"> The trespass offering deals with our sins, which are the issues of the sin within us, the sin which is our nature, our being, our constitution. Sins, the different fruits of sin, are also called offenses, trespasses, and transgressions. Therefore, we need both the sin offering and the trespass offering. We need the sin offering to deal with sin, the source of <span class="pg" data-page-id="377" id="377">[377]</span> our sins. We need the trespass offering to deal with all the issues of sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="MPOCDFUKm8cVcjpGd7ROS35y73MKYGrsW0PImFA2Wzbc3DwzZLz1gDLcK7CSHAOA3"> The sin offering and the trespass offering are actually of one category to deal with sin in total, including our sin and our sins. “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39643" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>). “Sin” here is a totality of sin which includes our sinful nature and our sinful deeds. Christ is the offering that deals with both sin and sins. In dealing with our sin, He is the sin offering. In dealing with our sins, He is the trespass offering. Because these offerings are both concerned with the same thing—dealing with the totality of sin—in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39644" data-verses="Leviticus 5:1">chapters five and six</span> of Leviticus they are sometimes applied interchangeably, with the trespass offering becoming the sin offering and the sin offering becoming the trespass offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="V7B55sygWuttI4KoZ4bOSqh41H8YRc2BybMHU3NWuBbXmv0xQiUlyWnEa-JNV4Dll"> In relation to the sin offering and the trespass offering, I would like to say a word concerning propitiation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39645" data-verses="Leviticus 14:18">Leviticus 14:18</span> speaks of the priest making propitiation for a leper before Jehovah. It is difficult to translate the Hebrew word for propitiation. The King James Version renders this Hebrew word as “atonement.” Atonement is a matter of at-one-ment. Two parties have a problem, perhaps a quarrel, that needs to be settled. Because of the problem, these parties are not at one. They need something that will appease their situation, solve their problem, and make them one. </p>
<p data-content-id="ivxFinYAwLQi2teoWLAO0sXEiaEO78tRoutdjeTon_4zq6XLkUjUpOe_VDOm3Pn7t"> Propitiation is a matter of appeasing a problem or a situation in which one party has offended another party or owes something to another party. Unless the problem is settled, there cannot be peace between the two parties. A third party comes in to act on behalf of the first party to remove the offense so that the second party can be one with the first party. This is to appease, to propitiate. </p>
<p data-content-id="187ceXh_NbRnYyu1mrKM_o0jYxjJhDgQKRD-2KHDg7OF95AMtokSZlUzK2LV54vgN"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39646" data-verses="Leviticus 14:1">Leviticus 14</span> the leper is one party, the offending party, and God is the other party, the offended party. The problem, of course, is leprosy. We have pointed out that leprosy signifies sin, that sin is rebellion, and that rebellion is Satan. These four things—leprosy, sin, rebellion, and Satan—are synonyms. This means that they are one. Because between <span class="pg" data-page-id="378" id="378">[378]</span> God and man there is the problem of leprosy, there is the need of an appeasing to get rid of the leprosy, which is sin, rebellion, and Satan himself. For this appeasing the two birds are not adequate. The two birds can accomplish the cleansing but not the propitiating. Propitiation requires the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, and the meal offering. Only when we have these four offerings can we have propitiation as well as cleansing. </p>
<p data-content-id="9XfKmc-D9mR_l4j2zl61bRPTQ4yHO1EyjHCSkford0o6f2fHKljszhGKeM9npgLuc"> A leper, a sinner who is under God’s condemnation and who has a problem with God, needs three things: healing, cleansing, and propitiating. For a leper to need propitiation means that he needs to be brought back into fellowship with God. Propitiation removes the obstacle between the leper and God. Christ has come not only to cleanse us but also to make propitiation for us. In order to make propitiation He had to be our sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, and meal offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="j-jDcdhlkFZU8qlJLAj5ysDguqYhyhfT2n3xMNxM3nxLGWTONa1r1tuZp-L9a064x"> We have seen the significance of the sin offering and the trespass offering. Now we need to see the significance of the burnt offering and the meal offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="TofT8HtRPh84NluTshenNJ4e5klZq9GX-6GWVXNVjM-AbkkrSnjYFGJ4XZJr1H9Yt"> Christ is the burnt offering to make us absolute for God. For this purpose He is also the meal offering to feed us, to supply us with food. In order to do anything we need food, which gives us the strength to live. If we would be absolute for God, we need something to supply us, something to support, sustain, and feed us. What we need is Christ as our meal offering, as our food. Christ is the meal offering for us to eat. The more we enjoy Christ as the meal offering, the more we shall live a life that is a burnt offering absolute for God. </p>
<p data-content-id="nRN-9RpWzYzdXhr-0W84uWhDVzv2yXUyMyOADopoPOVCtb3FQHmSh9OGRIQ_-D705"> After the problems of our sin and our sins have been solved, we need to enjoy Christ as the meal offering. The meal offering is a composition of fine flour and oil. The fine flour typifies the fineness of Christ in His humanity, and the oil typifies the Spirit. These two things, the fine flour and the oil, combined and mingled, become our food. In the morning especially, we may enjoy Christ as the fine flour mingled with oil, the Spirit. This is Christ as our meal <span class="pg" data-page-id="379" id="379">[379]</span> offering to support and sustain us that we may live a life that is absolutely for God as a burnt offering. </p>

This includes the house in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39666" data-verses="Leviticus 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>. Based upon the principle that Leviticus is written in the form of types, we may interpret the house in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39667" data-verses="Leviticus 14:33-53">14:33-53</span> as a type of the church. As New Testament believers, we recognize that our real house is not our physical house but the church. Without the proper church life, we are homeless. Only when we are in the church and live the proper church life are we truly at home. Many have testified upon entering into the church life that they are now at home. The house in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39668" data-verses="Leviticus 14:1">Leviticus 14</span>, therefore, typifies the church as our house, our home, and the leprosy in a house signifies sins and evils in the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39669" data-verses="Leviticus 14:33-48">vv. 33-48</span>). </p>

This signifies that when the condition of a church becomes abnormal, God causes the leprous sin to appear in the church, reminding and warning the believers that they no longer have a house to live in and are no longer able to enjoy all the blessings God promised in His salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="abOlojkYEV6S5Nyw1iDNLhoNQhZoXxNgoVyybWxTCvwbL9IKdQKnhKWGzjO26wOAP"> During the more than fifty years I have been in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="386" id="386">[386]</span> Lord’s recovery, I have passed through many turmoils. Sometimes the turmoil reached the point that there was leprosy in the house. When the church becomes leprous, sick because of sins and evils, we have the sense that we have lost our home, that we have become homeless. Furthermore, when the church is sick of leprosy, we lose the enjoyment of Christ. Since there is no longer a proper church, we are no longer able to enjoy all the blessings God has promised in His salvation. </p>

The owner’s coming and telling this to the priest signifies that the leading brothers or those who are concerned for the church approach the Lord or the apostle, the Lord’s deputy, and tell the Lord or His deputy. This is what we need to do when the church is sick. </p>

The communication and fellowship of the church should be kept under observation for a complete course of time.

After the Examination of Seven Days,<br/>if the Disease Has Spread in the Walls<br/>of the House, the Stones in Which<br/>the Disease Is Shall Be Removed and Thrown<br/>into an Unclean Place outside the City</h2><p data-content-id="dUhqhQwKWbXKSbqvLKXmrZODq6ObM9A-m0V4pRJtqQPpDGovAqJWJcKK1hwOATnaE"> “And the priest shall return on the seventh day and examine it; and if the disease has spread in the walls of the house, the priest shall order that they remove the stones in which the disease is, and throw them into an unclean place outside the city” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39675" data-verses="Leviticus 14:39-40">vv. 39-40</span>). This signifies that after the observation of a complete period of time, if the problem of the church is still spreading, the believer or believers <span class="pg" data-page-id="388" id="388">[388]</span> involved in the problem should be removed from the fellowship of the church and be considered unclean, like the outsiders (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39676" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:1">1 Cor. 5</span>). This means that when the church is sick of a certain disease, the elders should first observe the situation. If the problem is becoming worse, the source of the problem—the believer or believers who have become involved in the disease—should be removed from the fellowship, the communication, of the church in order to stop the spread of the disease and to eliminate the disease. Actually, the problem may need to be dealt with from many directions. How we handle the situation depends on our observation and on the wisdom we receive from God. </p>

Putting other stones in the place of the removed stones signifies the using of other believers to fill up the gap. When the church becomes sick with leprosy, it often becomes necessary to remove from the fellowship of the church the saints who are involved in the problem. This will create a gap, and we should seek to fill this gap with other believers. </p>

<p data-content-id="3lBTmaq9moHRumeUlLI0z9-labbxChxeMZAEbbLWdHR7eQxL9TMP84tRESuFndxAt"> In dealing with the leprosy in a house, it is not adequate to remove certain believers and then fill the gap with other believers. We need to have a new start in the church life, that is, to renew the church with new experiences of the Lord’s gracious works. This is typified by taking other mortar and plastering the house. This is not a matter of simply dealing with a problem but of bringing in the riches of Christ in a new way. If we are unable to do this but simply do something in a legal way to remove certain persons and replace them with others, this will make the church empty, and in this emptiness the church will suffer even more. Therefore, the leading ones need to pray, perhaps with fasting, that the church will receive something new in the experiences of Christ’s gracious works. Then the church life will be renewed, replastered with new mortar, and all the members will be happy about the renewed church life. </p>

In this message on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39693" data-verses="Leviticus 15:1-31">15:1-31</span> we shall cover the matter of the cleansing of the discharges from man’s and woman’s body. </p>
<p data-content-id="WlA3awOYhU9znfuKt6dvGiq4QUYhK0tfDhtg3P_T8AseHPoPSWYPV6PMcXDqPbKl8"> We have pointed out that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39694" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">chapters eleven through twenty-seven</span> of Leviticus intend to give us the way to live a holy life as God’s holy people. If we would live such a life, we need to realize that we are involved with four things. First, we are involved with the common matter of the contact with people. Second, we must recognize the uncleanness of our birth. The source, the origin, of our being is unclean. Third, we have the problem of our leprosy. Our condition is one of being filled with leprosy. Fourth, we have the problem of discharges. No matter what kind of person we may be, we all have discharges, and, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39695" data-verses="Leviticus 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> shows us, these discharges are altogether unclean. Furthermore, the uncleanness of our discharges is contagious. </p>
<p data-content-id="2RckI5Ct4Iw0lfg0o-7qXnsEeetTFcK0dqFXHy3GZc1Qzj85J-8LmfOv-1xMzMlJ0"> Leviticus indicates strongly that whatever comes out of our being is unclean. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39696" data-verses="Leviticus 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> tells us to stay away from any discharge that issues from the human body and from the contagion of uncleanness. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugJdCXLu0ey6qT0teoiBGH7MCsyDSqFo8Xz3Iczpu7TrQaSjH1QUlKlNLKEP00tlJ"> Because we were born uncleanness and are a totality of uncleanness, whatever comes out of us is unclean. Also, the uncleanness of what issues from us is contagious and therefore causes others to be unclean. This is the crucial point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39697" data-verses="Leviticus 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="f1SdNSV-jnmqSNmLFj2KduKqAlc6KoF0g5vVSa13IQ9kvvIAb-D_3fsbMnQfG6L1R"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39698" data-verses="Leviticus 16:1">Chapter sixteen</span> of Leviticus is actually a continuation of <span class="pg" data-page-id="396" id="396">[396]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39699" data-verses="Leviticus 10:1">chapter ten</span>. The intention of God’s revelation in the five chapters that come between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39700" data-verses="Leviticus 10:1">chapters ten</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39701" data-verses="Leviticus 16:1">sixteen</span> is to show us four basic troubling factors. The first of these factors is our contact with people. We should not consider this an insignificant thing. On the contrary, our contact with people is of great importance. Contacting the wrong kinds of persons can cause us to be defiled and thus discredit us in the matter of a holy living as God’s holy people. The second troubling factor is the uncleanness of our birth. We need to realize that our source, our origin, is uncleanness. We are uncleanness itself. Our birth, source, and constitution are all uncleanness. The third factor is our leprous condition. Inwardly and outwardly we are leprous. The fourth factor is our discharge with its uncleanness and contagion. All the discharges, all the things that issue from our body, are unclean and contagious. </p>
<p data-content-id="9XfKmc-D9mR_l4j2zl61bRPTW4yHG1EyjHCSkford0o6f2fHKljszhGKeM9npgLuc"> According to the Bible, our body is our embodiment. Our body is our being, our constitution. Whatever comes out of our body, out of our constitution, as a discharge is unclean and contagious. </p>

As we consider these verses, we realize that there is uncleanness everywhere. Everything has been dirtied by human discharges, by that which comes out of our being. The more we realize this, the more we shall treasure those verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39703" data-verses="Leviticus 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> which indicate that Christ is the factor of our cleansing. </p>
<p data-content-id="TofT8HtRPh84NluTshenNJ4e_klVo9GX-6GWVXNVjM-AbkkrSnjYFGJ4XZJr1H9Yt"> We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that whatever issues from us is unclean and should be condemned and eliminated. After reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39704" data-verses="Leviticus 15:1-13">15:1-13</span>, we may wonder where we can stay without being defiled by the uncleanness of human discharges. Everywhere there is the uncleanness that issues from us human beings. If we realize this, we shall not want to remain on earth but desire to be raptured. </p>

Whenever we come in our spirit to the word, we touch something within the word that washes us.

The definition given in most dictionaries is not according to the meaning of the Hebrew word. The Hebrew word translated “propitiation” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39732" data-verses="Leviticus 16:1">Leviticus 16</span> means to cover; it has the same root as the word for the cover of the ark. In the ark, the place where God was to meet with His people and where the people were to meet with God, were the two tablets of the Ten Commandments. This means that the tablets of the Ten Commandments were in front of God and in front of the one coming to meet with God. The Ten Commandments pointed out all the sins committed by the one who was approaching God. </p>

How could a sinful person approach and converse with the One who is love and light and who is righteous and holy? This problem had to be solved. Otherwise, there would be an obstacle, a hindrance, between God and the one approaching Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="BbO8eSfTx5R84H_f9kv8JKRBhG3T0cqg7Rva48wPNAlxcvoNCVQHbME6iRkopNA5y"> We have seen that we were born unclean and are surrounded by people who are unclean. Thus there is a problem not only with our birth but also with our contact with others. Through this contact it is very easy for us to be contaminated. Furthermore, in our condition we are altogether leprous; we are a totality of leprosy. In addition, whatever comes out of us as a discharge is unclean, contagious, and contaminating. How can such a person approach God, who is clean, holy, and righteous, and converse with Him? It is impossible. God loves man, but man is in a pitiful situation. This situation reveals what we need. We need propitiation. </p>
<p data-content-id="xpuW_vPofBGDzDc22724t8Rae5jnS0BSr8301X99RY97AKbZvApQctIkumW21xaSQ"> I have pointed out that the Hebrew word for propitiation means to cover and that the word for the cover of the ark comes from the same root. There was the need for the tablets of the Ten Commandments in the ark to be covered. Only if the Ten Commandments were covered could the situation between us and God be appeased. </p>
<p data-content-id="rCeQBKNuXLnpxNKjpL-6rcvyXmEO9HB5ztp7_KErmZE1m7T-GugDdoJ0xk-AO9IMP"> Propitiation appeases our situation. In propitiation it is not mainly God but our situation with God that is appeased. The problem is with us, not with God. God is not angry with us. God loves us, but there is nevertheless a problem between us and God. For this reason, our situation needs to be appeased by the cover that is placed over the condemning, judging commandments. </p>
<p data-content-id="dUhqhQwKWbXKSbqvLKXmrZODo6OXO9A-m0V4pRJtqQPpDGovAqJWJcKK1hwOATnaE"> We do not need to beg God to forgive us. He is ready to forgive us, once He has the standing to do so. Because God is righteous, His forgiveness requires that He have the standing to forgive us. Suppose we were to say, “God, I know that You love me. I beg You to forgive me.” If we said this, God would reply, “Yes, I do love you. There is no need for you to beg Me to forgive you. But what about the Ten Commandments? I shall put a cover over them for you. Then your <span class="pg" data-page-id="405" id="405">[405]</span> situation will be appeased.” How wonderful that through propitiation our situation with God has been appeased! </p>
<p data-content-id="QrptJJxnlubdylPzgsOm36q8G-PH2LPyv1OlLurgtE73Y3Ur-McK8L5I1R7Ma9Rtr"> In preaching the gospel, some have said that God is angry with us, but that Jesus, our Friend, asks God to do Him a favor and forgive us. According to this kind of gospel preaching, God grants the Lord’s request and forgives us. This way of preaching the gospel is absolutely wrong because it describes God altogether in a wrong way. </p>
<p data-content-id="Kbr2zMFu7prMv589VrFoje5aN-W_abKZ7yQ9bjy8JdXHTAd4mjuWZo9eiEivMyu1q"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39733" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span> says, “God so loved the world.” The “world” here means fallen mankind. Although mankind is fallen, God still loves mankind. We should not have the thought that He is angry with us. Instead of being angry with us, He loves us. He has loved us to such an extent that in eternity past He prepared a way first to cover our sins and then to remove them. In the Old Testament God’s economy was to cover man’s sins; in the New Testament God’s economy is to take away man’s sins. </p>
<p data-content-id="lo2rhE_cgAMwRI2ZJVIpYWqv3pSXl6e5Meoawkyfbmb_iVgZMNNND2h_d1VBdUhRD"> Even though in the Old Testament time man’s sins were not taken away, God still provided something to cover the Ten Commandments so that the situation of fallen man might be appeased. On the cover of the ark were the two cherubim watching over the Ten Commandments. In typology the cherubim signify God’s glory. Thus for the cherubim to watch over the Ten Commandments was for God’s glory to watch over the Ten Commandments. The glory of God was watching over the Ten Commandments, waiting to see what the holy and righteous God would do with the approaching sinner. A cover was inserted to cover the Ten Commandments so that the glory of God could not see the Ten Commandments but could see only the cover. This is the way it is with God: He sees only the cover; He does not see the Ten Commandments. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39734" data-verses="Leviticus 16:2">Leviticus 16:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39735" data-verses="Leviticus 16:13-15">13-15</span> this cover is called the propitiatory cover. Hence, in the Old Testament propitiation was, according to the Hebrew, a matter of covering. </p>
<p data-content-id="OETCsjMBdqbNfrPdG1o4GALTLHA4NO7bMBYHie8kfs2o1Fr5FqXL4WjAzs30TDaPr"> In the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, the word propitiation is used to denote the cover of the ark. The Greek word for propitiation means to appease <span class="pg" data-page-id="406" id="406">[406]</span> a situation between two parties. Between these parties there is a problem that makes them unable to converse. Then something takes place to appease the situation. In the Old Testament it is the cover of the ark that appeases the situation involving God and fallen man. Because the Ten Commandments were covered and the situation was appeased, the one approaching God could be at peace, and there was nothing to hinder God and the one approaching Him from conversing with each other. Therefore, the Old Testament reveals that the cover of the ark, in which were the Ten Commandments and which was in the holy of holies, was the place where God met with His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="4mdq3y0cOc3Dr86Vjcerq3e4qY40PYlfe9OOpxJJ8hAcXLR1eihN1Srq4IoiphC0s"> The King James Version uses the expression “mercy seat” to translate the Hebrew word for propitiatory cover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39736" data-verses="Leviticus 16:2">Lev. 16:2</span>) and “atonement” to translate the word for propitiate. Many theologians use the words atonement (an Old Testament matter) and redemption (a New Testament matter) interchangeably. Also, certain hymns use the word atonement where the word redemption is called for. What we have in the New Testament is not atonement but redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="o5HGAna4E3UbMG7NGiSbaPl5Um3RmYoLI3dKIr2iVbybx3hEM_7DGG6BX7Kk3dEPS"> Atonement means at-one-ment. To make atonement is to cause two parties to be one; it is to bring these parties into an at-one-ment, to make these parties one. In the Old Testament this atonement, this at-one-ment, equals propitiation. In our version of Leviticus we use the word propitiation instead of atonement. </p>
<p data-content-id="3lBTmaq9moHRumeUlLI0z9-lYbbxKhxeMZAEbbLWdHR7eQxL9TMP84tRESuFndxAt"> There is a difference between propitiation in the Old Testament and redemption in the New Testament. In the Old Testament sins were covered, but they were not taken away. This covering of sin and sins in the Old Testament was a matter of propitiation. In the New Testament sins are taken away. “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39737" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>). Here “sin” is a totality of sin and sins. The crucial point is that sins are not covered but are taken away. This is a matter of redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="G8WifseOG75eXksZ0Xg3wn7YfetID8YfLcO9OTK3bDlF2oEvqaaac2VQzRzH11-xg"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39738" data-verses="Hebrews 10:1-4">Hebrews 10:1-4</span>, propitiation in the Old Testament could not take away sins. If this propitiation had been able to take away sins, there would have been no need <span class="pg" data-page-id="407" id="407">[407]</span> for the people to offer the sin offering continually year after year. The repetition of the offering was an indication that the taking away of sins for the accomplishment of redemption was yet to take place. It was necessary for the Lord Jesus to come to die on the cross for our redemption. </p>

This signifies that the Lord Jesus alone can make propitiation for our sins. Only the Lord Jesus was qualified to die for us and for our sins. Only He was qualified to accomplish redemption for our sins in the holy of holies. Concerning this, the type in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39775" data-verses="Leviticus 16:1">Leviticus 16</span> is definite and clear. </p>

The bull <span class="pg" data-page-id="418" id="418">[418]</span> was for Aaron and his household, and the goat was for the entire people of Israel. The four horns were toward the four directions of the earth. Putting the blood of the bull and of the goat on the horns of the altar all around signifies that the efficacy of the redemption on the cross is toward the four corners of the earth. </p>

This signifies that the full efficacy of the blood shed on the cross by Christ is so that the sinner may be at peace in his heart. When we sinners look at the blood sprinkled on the altar, we know that our sin and sins have been dealt with. Knowing that the problem of sin has been solved, we have peace in our heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fv8eruG2C4An5ussdVnkAb4E09j5aBFRCDYUBaT7z4c3XGWu7IZmTcTRA2UgLmbJe"> Whereas the blood sprinkled on the altar is for our peace, the blood sprinkled on the propitiatory cover is for God’s satisfaction. First the blood was sprinkled on the propitiatory cover within the veil. This was for God to see. It is for His satisfaction. Then the blood was sprinkled on the offering altar in the outer court. This is for us to see. It is for our satisfaction. Both God and we are satisfied through the blood of the redeeming Christ. </p>

Because the people of God were still in this uncleanness, even the altar used by God for the redemption of His people was contaminated. By this we can see how contagious is the uncleanness of God’s people. This uncleanness has its source (Satan), its birth, and its living, which is leprosy. Therefore, <span class="pg" data-page-id="419" id="419">[419]</span> we are a totality of uncleanness discharging unclean things to contaminate others and make them unclean. By the cross of Christ this uncleanness has been dealt with and taken away. Now there is a clean situation in which we and God may enjoy each other. </p>

<p data-content-id="WlA3awOYhU9znfuKt6dvGiq4SUYwA0tfDhtg3P_T8AseHPoPSWYPV6PMcXDqPbKl8"> The holy of holies, the most holy place in the universe, was contaminated by the uncleanness of God’s redeemed people. Because the holy of holies was contacted by unclean people, even it needed propitiation. The same was true of the tent of meeting and the altar. The fact that propitiation was made for all these indicates that the sin offering is not only for the removal of uncleanness but also for the perfecting of holiness. What Christ accomplished on the cross was not only for the removal of our uncleanness but also for the perfecting of God’s holiness, into which we have been brought. Now we are in this holiness enjoying God as our holiness. </p>

This signifies that after we have received the redemption of the Lord Jesus and the problem of our sins has been solved, we need the cleansing of the Spirit that we may take Christ as our burnt offering to live for God by the life of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="f1SdNSV-jnmqSNmLFj2KduKqClcXDoF0g5vVSa13IQ9kvvIAb-D_3fsbMnQfG6L1R"> Before Aaron bathed himself, he offered the sin offering for himself and for the people. Then after he bathed, he came to the altar to offer the burnt offering for himself and also for the people. From this we can see that the sin offering is for the burnt offering, that the sin offering is offered in view of the burnt offering. In other words, the sin offering has a purpose—to bring us to the burnt offering. This means that we sinners have been redeemed for the purpose of becoming God’s satisfaction. We have been redeemed so that, taking Christ as our life and life supply, we might become those who in Christ live absolutely for God. Thus as redeemed ones, we are no longer sinners but those who are absolutely for God’s satisfaction. The complete redemption of Christ implies not only the removal of sin but also our living for God absolutely. This is the purpose of Christ’s redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="IcDSKk0-zyd2G7hWO-1B3c8q6IzrhjtjBspMyxBYA_3Aefgwi8mVa14ggFd5zUntv"> If Christ’s redemption only removed our sin but did not enable us to live for God absolutely, His redemption would not be complete. We praise the Lord that through Christ’s redemption not only has our sin been taken away, but we have been made by Christ into those who in Him as our burnt offering may now live for God absolutely. In this complete redemption, Christ is both the sin offering and the burnt offering. He is our sin offering for the removal of our sins, and He is our burnt offering to make us those who are absolutely for God. By taking Christ as our burnt offering and by living in Him by His life and with His life supply, we are able and qualified to live for God absolutely. </p>

If we would understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39802" data-verses="Leviticus 17:1">chapter seventeen</span>, we need to see that it is a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39803" data-verses="Leviticus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="cEGQRZcEFdiSW_luPEGi_zuTu8CWWnBiAywbXPclmSQESewfF2_kdR7dnAPblMLTy"> In order to see the connection between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39804" data-verses="Leviticus 16:1-2">Leviticus 16 and 17</span>, we need a view of the arrangement of this book. Leviticus is a book on God’s serving ones, the priests. In the preceding book, Exodus, the tabernacle was built up, the priesthood was set up, and, to some extent, the offerings were arranged. At the end of Exodus, the service to God from His people began. Following Exodus, there is the need of a book to tell us about the serving ones in God’s service, the priests, about the details concerning all the offerings, and about the kind of life and living the priests should have. The priests’ life should correspond to what God is. God is holy, so the living of the priests as God’s serving ones should also be holy. The priests should be holy even as God is holy. This is indicated by the sequence of the books of Exodus and Leviticus. </p>
<p data-content-id="YDsRD7ifPw-lp8lc5xue-re9-PbVGOgMuQ4KkOc2H7hurUt1fU4NGccyn3CnOpDOB"> The first ten chapters of Leviticus show us the offerings with the priesthood. The next five chapters show us who and what the serving ones are, what their origin, condition, and situation are, and what comes out of them. All these things are negative. Nevertheless, the negative portrait in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39805" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">chapters eleven through fifteen</span> is a background for presenting to us Christ as the One we need. <span class="pg" data-page-id="426" id="426">[426]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Eo8_f6xczFEz8Dhy4DUKmRXVndtKIuIMuEdkcPMoX47E1B39u_MgRBsuwxjcPeLGZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39806" data-verses="Leviticus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> we have a type, a shadow, of God’s redemption, which, at the time this book was written, was still to come. According to God’s concept and in His divine economy, there is the need of redemption. Because the Old Testament time was not the time for redemption to take place, a type, shadow, of the coming redemption was needed. This shadow is the propitiation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39807" data-verses="Leviticus 16:1">Leviticus 16</span>. In this propitiation four of the five basic offerings presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39808" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">chapters one through seven</span> are involved: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. The one offering not involved yet is the peace offering. Later, particularly in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39809" data-verses="Leviticus 19:1">chapter nineteen</span>, we shall see that the propitiated people enjoyed the peace offering. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39810" data-verses="Leviticus 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>, the propitiation is fully applied, but the result of the four offerings—the peace offering—is not yet applied. </p>

In type, this chapter signifies that we have been propitiated and that we may now enjoy Christ as the burnt offering and live on Him as the meal offering. Furthermore, we have come out of the camp to follow Him, the suffering One, bearing His reproach. What else do we need? It seems that we are not in need of anything. Using New Testament terms, we have been redeemed and, to some extent, replaced. We are living Christ as the life that is absolute for God, we are enjoying Him as our daily life supply, and we are following Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach and living a godly life. With us, everything is fine, but the situation around us is still very complicated. For this reason, there is the need of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39812" data-verses="Leviticus 17:1">chapter seventeen</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="4mdq3y0cOc3Dr86Vjcerq3e4kY40HYlfe9OOpxJJ8hAcXLR1eihN1Srq4IoiphC0s"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39813" data-verses="Leviticus 17:1">Leviticus 17</span> is a reminder and a warning regarding the abuse of the sacrifices. To abuse the sacrifices is to apply them wrongly, improperly. It is to apply the sacrifices not according to God’s economy but according to man’s choice, not according to God’s desire but according to our preference. There should be a limitation with respect to the application of the sacrifices. They should not be applied everywhere or anywhere or in the place of our choice. The application of the sacrifices is not a matter of our choice, desire, intention, <span class="pg" data-page-id="427" id="427">[427]</span> and enjoyment; it is a matter of God’s intention, desire, and choice. God has a unique choice regarding the use, the application, of the sacrifices prepared for Him. This is why the subject of this message is concerned with two things—taking care of the sacrifices and taking care of the blood. </p>
<p data-content-id="o5HGAna4E3UbMG7NGiSbaPl5am3RuYoLI3dKIr2iVbybx3hEM_7DGG6BX7Kk3dEPS"> First, we must take care of the sacrifices and then of the blood. The sacrifices (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39814" data-verses="Leviticus 17:5">vv. 5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39815" data-verses="Leviticus 17:7">7</span>) refer to Christ. In the whole universe Christ is the unique sacrifice. Eventually, for the sake of our need, this unique sacrifice becomes many sacrifices. It is one sacrifice in many aspects: the trespass offering, the sin offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering. Hence, Christ is one sacrifice becoming five sacrifices, or one sacrifice in five aspects. </p>
<p data-content-id="3lBTmaq9moHRumeUlLI0z9-lWbb9IhxeMZAEbbLWdHR7eQxL9TMP84tRESuFndxAt"> The sacrifices in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39816" data-verses="Leviticus 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> refer to Christ in His person. Christ is the unique sacrifice applied to our situation. As such a One, He meets our need in five aspects. He is our trespass offering, sin offering, burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering. Christ is everything to us. In particular, He is all the offerings. Therefore, to take care of the sacrifices means to take care of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="G8WifseOG75eXksZ0Xg3wn7YRetEB8YfLcO9OTK3bDlF2oEvqaaac2VQzRzH11-xg"> In the Bible, the blood refers to Christ’s redemptive work. Whereas the sacrifices refer to Christ’s person, the blood refers to Christ’s work. Our New Testament faith, the unique faith, is a composition of the person and work of Christ. When we put together Christ’s person and work, we have the Christian faith. We believe in Christ, and we believe in His work. This is our faith, which is according to the teaching of the New Testament and according to God’s eternal economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="cEGQRZcEFdiSW_luPEGi_zuTu8CLYnBiAywbXPclmSQESewfF2_kdR7dnAPblMLTy"> As believers in Christ, we treasure the two matters that constitute the faith in which we believe. We treasure Christ’s person, and we treasure Christ’s redemptive work. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39817" data-verses="Leviticus 17:1">Leviticus 17</span>, Christ’s person is typified by the sacrifices, and Christ’s work is typified by the blood. We must care for the sacrifices and the blood; that is, we must care for the person of Christ and His redemptive work. </p>
<p data-content-id="YDsRD7ifPw-lp8lc5xue-re9-PbMJOgMuQ4KkOc2H7hurUt1fU4NGccyn3CnOpDOB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39818" data-verses="Leviticus 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> of Leviticus, the Israelites were <span class="pg" data-page-id="428" id="428">[428]</span> charged not to offer their sacrifices in any place they desired. Instead, they were required to bring their sacrifices to a unique place, to the one place chosen and designated by God. God’s unique choice was “the entrance of the tent of meeting,” “before the tabernacle of Jehovah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39819" data-verses="Leviticus 17:4">v. 4</span>). This unique place—the entrance of the tent of meeting—signifies the church. Today the church is the place of God’s tabernacle, the place of the tent of meeting. The sacrifice was to be offered only at the place where the tabernacle was. This signifies that today Christ should be applied in the church, the place of God’s dwelling. In Leviticus God’s dwelling place on earth was the tabernacle. In the New Testament age God’s dwelling place is the church. Therefore, as signified by offering the sacrifices at the entrance of the tent of meeting, we should apply Christ in the church, the place of God’s dwelling today. To apply Christ outside the church is to abuse Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Eo8_f6xczFEz8Dhy4DUKmRXVndtvEuIMuEdkcPMoX47E1B39u_MgRBsuwxjcPeLGZ"> Concerning the matter of applying Christ in the church, I would ask you to consider why we do not have a name to designate what we are as the church. We are simply the church. Often we are reproached because we do not use a name to designate the church, such as Episcopalian, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, or Baptist. To name ourselves in this way would be to offer sacrifices anywhere, according to our taste. This is typified in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39820" data-verses="Leviticus 17:1">Leviticus 17</span> by offering the sacrifices in an abusive way. </p>
<p data-content-id="DAXcbsbzMAWBUrvVTy0dqdzSf2I0d5ymf8MzGShj-RTqJixX3OkvHHtouXshNnro9"> To apply Christ in an abusive way is to apply Him without regulation, restriction, or limitation. Today many like to have a proper noun as a name to designate the church. But to designate the church in this way is to denominate it, and this is to be abusive in the application of the sacrifices. </p>
<p data-content-id="Slkwfbwd8WAXYyyQY7UU1NsI8w2jbLyLwR1_r8BaVpq62ItkpbBUwNo3LENsEhxaS"> Many years ago I had a conversation with some Christians who found fault with our standing concerning the church. They said to me, “You are too narrow. Christ is omnipresent. He is everywhere. He is present in China, in Great Britain, in America. Christ is in every church—Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian.” I answered by saying, “Yes, Christ is everywhere. But why does He have to bear so <span class="pg" data-page-id="429" id="429">[429]</span> many names? Is there a Chinese Christ? A British Christ? An American Christ? Is there a Lutheran Christ or a Wesleyan Christ?” To answer these questions with a “no” is to lose the case. </p>

This long section of the Word is equivalent to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39864" data-verses="Ephesians 4:17">Ephesians 4:17—5:14</span> in the New Testament, which charges the holy people of God to put off, as regards their former manner of life, the old man and put on the new man, which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39865" data-verses="Ephesians 4:22">Eph. 4:22</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39866" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">24</span>), living a life that is holy, as God is holy. </p>
<p data-content-id="huE1la_VvhqT-E_rMeCC-1ovPtV2bjHXdPzx2sbNshy0olh7DO3UOWL5zObECuN3-"> By reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39867" data-verses="Ephesians 4:17">Ephesians 4:17—5:14</span> we are helped to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39868" data-verses="Leviticus 18:1">Leviticus 18—20</span>, and by reading this section in Leviticus we are helped to understand this portion of Ephesians. The more we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39869" data-verses="Ephesians 4:17">Ephesians 4:17—5:14</span>, the more we understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39870" data-verses="Leviticus 18:1">chapters eighteen through twenty</span> of Leviticus. In Old Testament terms, God’s people were not to live according to the Egyptians, among whom they once lived, nor according to the Canaanites. They were to put off the old man with the old manner of life and to put on the new man with the new manner of life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39871" data-verses="Leviticus 18:3">Leviticus 18:3</span> says, “You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt, in which you lived, and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan to which I am bringing you; you shall not walk in their customs.” Here we see that the Israelites were to live a new life, a life neither in the manner of the Egyptians, among whom they once lived, nor in the manner of the Canaanites, to whose land they were to be brought, but in the manner of God’s holy people. To put off the living of the Egyptians and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="438" id="438">[438]</span> Canaanites was to put off the old man, and to live a life according to God’s holiness was to put on the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="Uy7vFEnwR55XavTnTo3EqFJC2pHpKdfDirVdCYDVpVTdtZKnpVBJGlLm1pEB8cOAx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39872" data-verses="Leviticus 18:1-20">Leviticus 18 through 20</span> we have many ordinances and statutes of the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39873" data-verses="Leviticus 20:22">20:22</span>). The law is composed firstly of the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments, which are the basic elements of the law, are simple, short, and definite. Because the Ten Commandments are brief, they need explanation and extension. The ordinances and statutes are explanations and extensions of the Ten Commandments. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39874" data-verses="Leviticus 18:1">Leviticus 18—20</span> is full of statutes and ordinances, which are explanations and extensions of the Ten Commandments. As a whole, the law is composed of the Ten Commandments plus the explanations and extensions of the Ten Commandments. </p>
<p data-content-id="MPOCDFUKm8cVcjpGd7ROS35yx3MvWGrsW0PImFA2Wzbc3DwzZLz1gDLcK7CSHAOA3"> Many readers of the Bible, and even some translators of the Bible, do not understand the difference between statutes and ordinances and regard them as synonymous. Actually, there is an important difference between an ordinance and a statute. An ordinance is a statute with a judgment. However, a statute, a regulation, that does not include a judgment is simply a statute. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39875" data-verses="Leviticus 18:1">chapters eighteen through twenty</span> of Leviticus, there are regulations that are without judgments; these regulations do not tell us how to judge a case. These regulations are statutes. Other regulations include judgments and therefore should be considered ordinances and not merely statutes. </p>
<p data-content-id="V7B55sygWuttI4KoZ4bOSqh4_H85ec2BybMHU3NWuBbXmv0xQiUlyWnEa-JNV4Dll"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39876" data-verses="Leviticus 18:1">Leviticus 18—20</span> there is no repetition of the Ten Commandments, but there is the explanation and extension of the Ten Commandments. For example, one of the Ten Commandments forbids the worship of idols, and in the regulations concerning witchcraft there is an extension of this commandment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="39877" data-verses="Leviticus 19:26">19:26</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39878" data-verses="Leviticus 19:31">31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39879" data-verses="Leviticus 20:6">20:6</span>). Another example is the extension in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39880" data-verses="Leviticus 20:9">20:9</span> of the commandment to honor our parents. This verse says, “If any man curses his father or his mother, he shall certainly be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother; the guilt for his blood shall be upon him.” Many other examples of statutes and ordinances can be found in these chapters. In this message I shall only deal with certain <span class="pg" data-page-id="439" id="439">[439]</span> matters, which are quite peculiar and are not covered elsewhere. </p>

The issue of these offerings is the peace offering. This means that these four offerings issue in a result, and this result is that we enjoy peace with God and with God’s people. This is the peace offering. </p>

Our enjoyment of Christ as these four offerings will have an issue, a result—the enjoyment of Christ as our peace offering for us to have fellowship with God and with our fellow believers. </p>

In other words, we need a new washing, a new bathing in the Word or in the Spirit, so that we can have a fresh remembrance of the Lord. When we have a fresh enjoyment of the Lord, He also will have a fresh enjoyment because of our fresh enjoyment. </p>

Furthermore, we should be restrained in our walk, especially in our speaking. It is wrong to speak in a loose way without restraint.

This refers to a kind of consecration that is not stable or sure. A vow, however, is like an oath made with God that cannot be retracted. It must be kept. A saint may consecrate himself to God of his free will, but after a period of time, he may forget about it. But a vow cannot be cancelled.

An Offering for a Vow, for a Freewill Offering, or as a Peace Offering That Was Offered<br/>to Jehovah for a Burnt Offering Needing<br/>to Be a Male without Blemish,<br/>of the Herd, of the Sheep, or of the Goats,<br/>That It Might Be Accepted</h2><p data-content-id="QrptJJxnlubdylPzgsOm36q4B-PL0LPyv1OlLurgtE73Y3Ur-McK8L5I1R7Ma9Rtr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="39988" data-verses="Leviticus 22:18-21">22:18-21</span> we see that an offering for a vow, for a freewill offering, or as a peace offering that was offered to Jehovah for a burnt offering had to be a male without blemish, of the herd, of the sheep, or of the goats, that it might be accepted. This signifies that our offering of the Christ whom we experience that is offered to God as God’s food must be without blemish, that it might be accepted. <span class="pg" data-page-id="459" id="459">[459]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Kbr2zMFu7prMv589VrFoje5eK-WzYbKZ7yQ9bjy8JdXHTAd4mjuWZo9eiEivMyu1q"> An offering for a vow, for a freewill offering, and as a peace offering could all be for a burnt offering. The significance of the burnt offering is to be absolute for God. We should be absolute for God, but often we are not absolute for Him. Thus we may wish to make up our mind to have a vow with God that we would be absolute for God for the rest of our life. This vow offered to God eventually becomes a burnt offering with the significance of being absolute for God for our entire life. </p>
<p data-content-id="lo2rhE_cgAMwRI2ZJVIpYWqrwpSbr6e5Meoawkyfbmb_iVgZMNNND2h_d1VBdUhRD"> A freewill offering may also become a burnt offering. Of our free will we may choose to be absolute for God. Such a freewill offering may also be offered to God as a burnt offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="OETCsjMBdqbNfrPdG1o4GALXMHA0DO7bMBYHie8kfs2o1Fr5FqXL4WjAzs30TDaPr"> It is difficult to explain how a peace offering may be offered to God as a burnt offering. I believe that many of us have experienced this at the Lord’s table. While we were enjoying the Lord as the peace offering at His table, we said to ourselves, “In the past I was not absolute for the Lord. Now as I am enjoying Him, I decide to be absolute for the Lord from now on.” This is the peace offering becoming a burnt offering. </p>

The next item is the festivals, which are for rest and enjoyment, both of which are types of Christ as our rest and enjoyment. This indicates that in Leviticus, a book of God’s priesthood for God’s service in the fellowship of God, our service results, issues, in Christ as the rest and enjoyment we have with God and with one another.

A convocation is a special <span class="pg" data-page-id="466" id="466">[466]</span> assembly called for a special and particular purpose. The seasons appointed by Jehovah as holy convocations signify the gathering of God’s redeemed people to have a festival with God for His joy and enjoyment that the redeemed may participate in it with Him and with one another. A festival, therefore, was for nothing except rest and enjoyment. This rest and enjoyment were not individual but corporate. </p>

The weekly season—the sabbath—signifies rest for God’s redeemed people to enjoy with God and with one another. Every seven days there was to be a day for rest and enjoyment. On that day there was to be an assembly, a holy convocation. This indicates that on the sabbath God’s redeemed people were to gather together. If they did not come together, they would have been able to enjoy rest with God, but they could not have enjoyed rest with God and with one another in a corporate way. </p>

The Passover was on the fourteenth day of the first month of the Jewish year. On this day Jesus Christ was slain as our Passover. Whereas the Passover in the Old Testament was a type, Christ is the real Passover to us. He is the reality of the Passover, the fulfillment in history of the type of the Passover. The feast of the Passover was followed by the feast of unleavened bread and the feast of the firstfruits. Christ’s resurrection was the fulfillment of the feast of the firstfruits and is the reality of this feast. The feast of the firstfruits was followed by the feast of Pentecost. </p>

In other words, what Christ has accomplished and achieved in His history can become our experience. This is why the first group of feasts can be applied in two ways—to Christ’s history and to our Christian experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="xpuW_vPofBGDzDc22724t8Reb5jGZ0BSr8301X99RY97AKbZvApQctIkumW21xaSQ"> When we were saved, we experienced the feast of the Passover. Because Christ was slain for us, God could pass over us. We thus enjoyed the reality of the Passover. What the Jews enjoyed in Egypt was merely a type; what we enjoy is the reality.

<p data-content-id="0Mc2AjIjEcgnOIfYqSBXyGYDlncMnEwKUmlwVwYbl9P2sUtxfBsUTcI2aw4ETTmDP"> In our experience we also enjoy Christ as our feast of the firstfruits.

He lives within us as the firstfruit for our daily enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="7KDrIgxvPeGxEknpu13p9NRNjL23CvFquTAbQrYdftQwur0W0NCp1o6e3TlKTMR6I"> The fourth feast, the feast of Pentecost, or the feast of weeks, took place seven weeks after Christ’s resurrection. The time from Christ’s resurrection to the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit was poured out from the heavens by the ascended Christ, was fifty days. Pentecost means fifty days. Christ’s resurrection was on the first day of the week. This day is also called the eighth day. Counting seven weeks from this day, we reach the fiftieth day, which was also a first day of the week and an eighth day. Christ rose up on the first day of the week, and the day of Pentecost took place also on the first day of the week. </p>
<p data-content-id="_WsCu0UVGd8o3Q6ZANIAJepNlWd9K7Zx5OwRVVx1PunU7kpT6WA8gEA6LgK96lE05"> After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples over a period of forty days (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40038" data-verses="Acts 1:3">Acts 1:3</span>). Although He would appear and then disappear, He never left the disciples. On the day of His resurrection. He appeared to them and breathed Himself as the life-giving Spirit into them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40039" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>), and from that time onward He was living not only among the disciples but also within them. The Lord’s appearing to the disciples simply means that He made His presence visible to them; it does not mean that He ever left them. The Lord’s appearing and disappearing was a training to the disciples. During those forty days after His resurrection, the Lord Jesus was training His disciples to realize and enjoy His invisible presence. Even though He was invisible, they could still appreciate and experience His invisible presence. Today the Lord Jesus is also with us and in us. We cannot see Him. But we believe that He is with us and in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="BbO8eSfTx5R84H_f9kv8JKRFkG3Twcqg7Rva48wPNAlxcvoNCVQHbME6iRkopNA5y"> After those forty days, the Lord Jesus ascended to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="477" id="477">[477]</span> heavens, leaving the disciples on earth. For the next ten days they prayed continually in one accord. Then on the fiftieth day a great event took place—the consummation of the Triune God was poured out. This consummation is the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound Spirit of the processed Triune God. Such a One—the totality of the Triune God—was poured out upon the one hundred twenty disciples, who represented the Body of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="xpuW_vPofBGDzDc22724t8Reb5jnW0BSr8301X99RY97AKbZvApQctIkumW21xaSQ"> Pentecost is the full issue of Christ’s resurrection, and Christ’s resurrection is the issue of His death. Without death there cannot be resurrection. The Lord’s death on the cross issued in His resurrection, and His resurrection issued not only in His ascension but also in His being poured out as the consummation of the processed Triune God upon His Body. Since this happened on Pentecost, the feast of Pentecost is a great manifestation of God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="rCeQBKNuXLnpxNKjpL-6rcv2SmEO5HB5ztp7_KErmZE1m7T-GugDdoJ0xk-AO9IMP"> As a result of what took place on the day of Pentecost, the Body of Christ came into existence. Prior to that time, in God’s economy there was only the individual Christ to fulfill the desire of God’s heart. But at Pentecost the Body of Christ came into being to match Christ, to make Him a corporate Christ. Now Christ has a Body, and this Body is His increase, His enlargement, His extension, even His expansion. Today we are a part of Christ’s extension. Every local church is a small part of the universal extension of Christ, which came into being on the day of Pentecost. </p>
<p data-content-id="dUhqhQwKWbXKSbqvLKXmrZOHt6OXK9A-m0V4pRJtqQPpDGovAqJWJcKK1hwOATnaE"> The first four festivals form a group that bears a great significance. This significance includes the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, the ascension of Christ, and the outpouring of the consummated Spirit of the processed Triune God to produce the Body of Christ as the enlargement, the increase, the extension, the expansion, of the unlimited, individual Christ into a universal, corporate Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="QrptJJxnlubdylPzgsOm36q4D-PH6LPyv1OlLurgtE73Y3Ur-McK8L5I1R7Ma9Rtr"> Historically, the first four festivals are all related to Christ.

In a spiritual form, as the consummation of the processed Triune God, Christ is also the fulfillment and reality of Pentecost. All these historical <span class="pg" data-page-id="478" id="478">[478]</span> instances have become our experience. We have participated in the Passover, in the unleavened bread, and in the firstfruit, and we have become a part of Pentecost. </p>
<p data-content-id="Kbr2zMFu7prMv589VrFoje5eI-W_WbKZ7yQ9bjy8JdXHTAd4mjuWZo9eiEivMyu1q"> Pentecost is a matter of forty-nine days plus the first day of the week. This involves eight first days, from the first first day, the day of resurrection, to the eighth first day, which is the fiftieth day. This indicates from resurrection to resurrection. Here everything is in resurrection, for we have eight times resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="lo2rhE_cgAMwRI2ZJVIpYWqrypSbj6e5Meoawkyfbmb_iVgZMNNND2h_d1VBdUhRD"> We all are those in resurrection. We were produced on the first first day of the week, and we have come to the eighth first day. Now we are a part of Christ’s expansion, part of His increase, enlargement, and extension. No longer is Christ merely an individual Christ; He is now a corporate Christ. This corporate Christ includes us. The church, therefore, is Christ incorporated. </p>
<p data-content-id="OETCsjMBdqbNfrPdG1o4GALXOHA0LO7bMBYHie8kfs2o1Fr5FqXL4WjAzs30TDaPr"> We need to see that we are now in Pentecost and that the component of Pentecost is eight times resurrection. Here we have the expansion of the incorporated Christ. This expansion as the enlargement, the increase, of Christ is actually the mingling of the processed Triune God with His chosen and redeemed people. There is such a mingling in the universe, a mingling that is the achievement of God’s eternal economy and the fulfillment of God’s eternal desire. We may not have much realization of this today, but we shall have the full realization of it in the New Jerusalem. Do you know what the New Jerusalem is? The New Jerusalem is the real increase, enlargement, expansion, and extension of the all-inclusive, immeasurable, untraceable Christ, who fills all in all. Praise the Lord that we all are parts of the enlargement of Christ produced on the day of Pentecost! </p>

<p data-content-id="4mdq3y0cOc3Dr86Vjcerq3e8oY4pNYlfe9OOpxJJ8hAcXLR1eihN1Srq4IoiphC0s"> After living on earth as a God-man for thirty-three and a half years, the Lord Jesus died on the cross as the fulfillment and reality of the type of the Passover. By His death on the cross He accomplished redemption and terminated all the negative things in the universe. The outcome of such a death was resurrection with the issue of the divine life, which is the reality of the consummated Triune God to be our portion. In Christ’s resurrection we all have a portion in this consummated Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="o5HGAna4E3UbMG7NGiSbaPl9Wm3IlYoLI3dKIr2iVbybx3hEM_7DGG6BX7Kk3dEPS"> After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens. In His ascension He poured out Himself as the consummation of the processed Triune God in the form of the economical Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="3lBTmaq9moHRumeUlLI0z9-habbYAhxeMZAEbbLWdHR7eQxL9TMP84tRESuFndxAt"> Although our God is eternally perfect, He still needed a consummation. Before His incarnation, He was merely God without a consummation. But as the result of the processes through which He passed, He has been consummated. The consummation of the processed Triune God is the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound Spirit. As such a consummation, He poured out Himself upon us, making us a part of His enlargement. This is the significance of Pentecost. </p>
<p data-content-id="G8WifseOG75eXksZ0Xg3wn7cdetlI8YfLcO9OTK3bDlF2oEvqaaac2VQzRzH11-xg"> Pentecost is the issue of Christ’s resurrection, and His resurrection is the issue of His all-inclusive death. All this has become a wonderful feast for God and for us. </p>

By the time we come to the feast of Pentecost, all the negative things have been cleared away, and all the positive <span class="pg" data-page-id="484" id="484">[484]</span> things have been released. The processed Triune God as the consummated One has been poured upon us to bring us into Himself so that we may be His extension, enlargement, increase, and expansion. Now we are Christ’s Body, and in this Body we have the mingling of the consummated, processed Triune God with the chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed tripartite man. The entire universe is for this, and it will remain forever. Eventually, the Body of Christ will become the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth as the complete, eternal testimony of the consummated Triune God with His redeemed ones. </p>

The second group of three feasts took place in the second half of the year. The first four feasts point to the past and to the present. These feasts have been fulfilled in Christ, yet we are still experiencing and enjoying them. We are enjoying the feast of Passover, and we are still in the feast of unleavened bread and the feast of the firstfruits. Furthermore, we are still in the feast of Pentecost, which is actually a feast of the church. </p>

This feast signifies God’s calling together of His scattered people (the dispersed Israelites) and His reminding them that He will issue such a call to them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40056" data-verses="Matthew 24:31">Matt. 24:31</span>; cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40057" data-verses="Isaiah 27:13">Isa. 27:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40058" data-verses="Psalms 81:3">Psa. 81:3</span>). </p>

Here we see that the feast of the blowing of trumpets was on the first day of the seventh month, the beginning of the second half of the year. This signifies the second half of God’s redemption, which is to be accomplished on Israel, the first half having been accomplished on the church. Although the second half of God’s redemption will be applied to Israel, it will still be related to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fv8eruG2C4An5ussdVnkAb4A39j5WBFRCDYUBaT7z4c3XGWu7IZmTcTRA2UgLmbJe"> Between the fourth feast, Pentecost, and the fifth feast, the blowing of trumpets, there appears to be nothing. Actually, this interval is the church age, which is called the age of mystery. The church age lasts from the day of Pentecost, when the church came into being, until the day God calls His scattered people to come back together. </p>
<p data-content-id="CmWO4n8XWbzptjiYJJrutWLpMtwSFtdWPFMX_iz9FQow2HICWW0e_sbr39oUdQ53H"> The feasts of Pentecost and the blowing of trumpets may be compared to two distant mountain peaks which appear to be close together but actually are very far apart. We may liken the distance between these two peaks to the time span between the feast of Pentecost and the feast of the blowing of trumpets. The time span has already been more than nineteen hundred years. This long period of time is the age of the church, the age of mystery. </p>

They lost their homeland because they rejected the God of rest. Only a part of the homeland has been recovered, and the Jews today are still struggling, for they are a people without rest. When the trumpet sounds, God will call His scattered people, who have so long been without rest, back to the land of their fathers. Then they will have rest with God. They will enjoy Christ as the absolute and thorough rest. For the Jews, that will be a real feast. <span class="pg" data-page-id="486" id="486">[486]</span> </p>

This signifies that from the time the children of Israel slew the Lord Jesus and were scattered, there has been nothing among them that could be a memorial before God. But at the Lord’s coming back, God’s calling them together from their dispersion back to their fathers’ land will be a real memorial to them. </p>

<p data-content-id="nRN-9RpWzYzdXhr-0W84uWhHQzvb5XUyMyOADopoPOVCtb3FQHmSh9OGRIQ_-D705"> God is a God of rest. He worked, but after He worked He rested. In Genesis God rested not by Himself but with man. After His work, God enjoyed rest with man. Therefore, on the seventh day both God and man were at rest. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fv8eruG2C4An5ussdVnkAb4A19j5eBFRCDYUBaT7z4c3XGWu7IZmTcTRA2UgLmbJe"> In order for there to be a jubilee, it was necessary for God’s people to have the practice of observing the sabbath year. Every seventh year was to be a sabbath, and that year was to be a rest for man and also for the land. It was a year of rest for God, for man, and for the land. </p>
<p data-content-id="CmWO4n8XWbzptjiYJJrutWLpOtwSNtdWPFMX_iz9FQow2HICWW0e_sbr39oUdQ53H"> The sabbath day refers to Christ, and the sabbath year also refers to Christ. Christ is our sabbath not merely for one day but for a full year. Hence, the sabbath year denotes Christ in His fullness as our rest. We need to enjoy Him not only as our sabbath day but also as our sabbath year, that is, not only as our rest in part but as our rest in full. The sabbath year is for us to enjoy Christ in full as our rest with <span class="pg" data-page-id="500" id="500">[500]</span> God. If we keep this in mind, we shall enjoy much more of Christ. </p>

Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its produce; but in the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath of solemn rest, a sabbath to Jehovah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40133" data-verses="Leviticus 25:2-4">vv. 2-4a</span>). The sabbath day being for man, one day out of every week, and the sabbath year being for the land, one whole year out of every seven years, signify that Christ is the realm of the full rest that we may enjoy Him as our rest to the fullest. </p>

This signifies that rest is purely and wholly of grace and that all human labor should cease absolutely. When the land rests, the laborers, the farmers working on the land, must also rest. It is good to have a long rest, but such a time of rest may be a test to us. We may become bored and be tempted to do something that is contrary to the divine thought. We all need to learn how to labor with God and also how to cease our work and rest with God as long as He desires to rest. </p>

Although the land still belonged to its owners, what the land produced belonged to everyone, to every kind of person, and even to the cattle and all the animals.

In this common enjoyment of the produce of the land, there is real freedom. </p>

According to God’s will, we should have a proper enjoyment of all things that are in common. The possession of the land is not common, for the land still belongs to each owner. What is common is the produce of the land in the seventh year. In this year everything produced by the land becomes common for the purpose of enjoyment. For this purpose, God blesses the land to produce food threefold. This practice of keeping the sabbath year ushers us into the jubilee. </p>

This shouting is, of course, not of mourning but of rejoicing; it is a joyful shouting. </p>
<p data-content-id="JYgdOTAphL2MixIdDMe3gVgvgZqhLUwH83TVGMXXC5x0rPf1TViep-9RX2Pq_QKeG"> God realized that in ancient times there was, economically speaking, the need for natural resources to be balanced among the children of Israel. After the Israelites entered into the good land, the land was divided among them by lots. None of these lots was to be sold permanently. Rather, in the year of jubilee any lots that had been sold were to be returned to the original owners. </p>
<p data-content-id="zLs19c8l0fJmVCIlaXT2eNraw7Rkyxx4r18qhLGRHCQGX8rX56yBc-Lf9eVsYHyhn"> During the years before the jubilee, some of the people might not have been able to keep their property. Because of poverty or illness they might have been forced to sell their property in whole or in part. However, at the time of jubilee, at the time of shouting, the land reverted to its owner. This return of the land was God’s way of balancing the ownership of land among the people. Thus there could not be any landlords, for in God’s wisdom the divine regulation, the divine ordinance, was a balance of the natural resources. This ordinance was to be put into effect every fifty years. From this we see that thirty-five centuries ago, a long time before Marx invented communism, God made provision in the holy Word for the balance of the land. Every fifty years, without the original owners doing anything or paying anything, the land was returned to them and once again became their possession. </p>
<p data-content-id="abOlojkYEV6S5Nyw1iDNLhoJShZkRxNgoVyybWxTCvwbL9IKdQKnhKWGzjO26wOAP"> In type, the jubilee portrays our situation as poor sinners. Our situation was that the longer we lived, the more we lost of our divinely allotted portion. Because we lived in a sinful way, we lost the divine rights. The more we committed sin, the more of these rights we lost. Eventually, we sold all that we had inherited by birth. We even lost ourselves. We sold ourselves not to a proper buyer but to Satan and sin. This was the reason Paul could say, “I am fleshly, sold under sin” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40137" data-verses="Romans 7:14">Rom. 7:14b</span>). Like Paul, we also were slaves sold to sin; we had lost to Satan our rights. We should not consider Satan and sin two separate things. These two are one. Therefore, when we sold ourselves to sin, we sold ourselves to Satan and thus fell into the hands of Satan under sin. As <span class="pg" data-page-id="503" id="503">[503]</span> descendants of Adam, we all had sold the rights allotted to us by God and even sold ourselves to sin and Satan. Furthermore, we could do nothing about our situation; we did not have the means to redeem ourselves. We were hopeless. Then one day, jubilee came. </p>
<p data-content-id="bMciakEq1jnYyMA9zOc4fi_uFFB210kBRXyiszf2beiMhuuovJ4PBc3b8Pwvp8oTA"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40138" data-verses="Luke 4:18-19">Luke 4:18 and 19</span> the Lord Jesus proclaimed the jubilee with words of grace (see Life-study of Luke, Messages Twelve and Sixty-four through Sixty-nine). When He came, jubilee came with Him. Christ has accomplished the full redemption of God for sinners. Now when we preach the gospel, we make a proclamation of the New Testament jubilee. </p>

We had lost our divine possession, but in the New Testament jubilee our possession has been returned to us for our enjoyment. In the jubilee we are also restored to our family. If we put all these matters together, we shall have a complete understanding of what jubilee is.

The produce of the land became free and common not only to man but also to the beasts. </p>

First, it could be redeemed by his nearest relative. This is a matter of grace. Second, if he had the means, he could redeem it himself. Third, if he did not have a relative to redeem it for him and if he could not redeem it himself, he could wait for the year of jubilee, when the sold possession would spontaneously be restored to him. This also is a matter of grace. The jubilee is thus a very good type of God’s grace. </p>

This signifies that if a believer has lost the enjoyment of the church life, it can be restored only within a short limit of God’s grace.

We may take advantage of a brother not only in one way and in one aspect but in a number of ways and in a number of aspects. We should not do this, for we should never take advantage of a brother who is weak. Instead, we should take care of him in love so that he may live before the Lord as we do. We should live by Christ, in Christ, and with Christ, and our brother should live this way with us. </p>

An Israelite Brother Who Became Poor<br/>and Sold Himself to Another Brother<br/>Was Not to Be Made a Slave<br/>but a Hired Servant<br/>until the Year of Jubilee</h2><p data-content-id="zLs19c8l0fJmVCIlaXT2eNra-7Rowxx4r18qhLGRHCQGX8rX56yBc-Lf9eVsYHyhn"> “If your brother beside you becomes poor and sells himself to you, you shall not make him serve as a slave. He shall be with you as a hired servant and as a sojourner. He shall serve with you until the year of jubilee” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40179" data-verses="Leviticus 25:39-40">vv. 39-40</span>). This signifies that if a brother becomes poor spiritually and is in debt to you, you should not consider him as your slave but as a helper to you until a revival comes to him. In this point we interpret jubilee as a kind of spiritual revival. </p>
<p data-content-id="abOlojkYEV6S5Nyw1iDNLhoJchZofxNgoVyybWxTCvwbL9IKdQKnhKWGzjO26wOAP"> In the church life a certain saint may be in debt to you spiritually speaking. Because a saint may owe you something, it is easy for you to consider this one to be your slave. We may have such a feeling in our heart, and our attitude and spirit may express the feeling that the one indebted to us is our slave. This is wrong. No matter how much a saint may owe us spiritually, we should consider that one not as a slave nor even as a servant but as a helper until he is <span class="pg" data-page-id="519" id="519">[519]</span> revived by the grace of God. Then this one who has been under our care will be fully recovered. In a number of cases, certain brothers rendered spiritual help to a weaker one, but this kind of help eventually became an offense to the one who was helped. The more a saint was helped, the more he was offended. From this we see that it is possible for our spiritual care of others to cause offense. If our spirit and attitude are wrong, if we consider ourselves superior to the ones we are helping and look down on them, if we regard them as lowly slaves or servants, our help and care will, in the long run, result in offense. This should be a warning to us. Whenever we are helping or caring for a weaker brother, we need to respect him. Even in gospel preaching we should not consider ourselves superior to those to whom we preach. Likewise, in home meetings and in small group meetings, we should never regard ourselves as leaders and think that we are higher than or superior to the ones we are helping. Such an attitude offends others. </p>
<p data-content-id="bMciakEq1jnYyMA9zOc4fi_uLFB670kBRXyiszf2beiMhuuovJ4PBc3b8Pwvp8oTA"> In helping others we should have the attitude that we are their servants. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40180" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:5">2 Corinthians 4:5</span> Paul says, “We do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus’ sake.” Paul was an apostle and he had God’s oracle, yet he did not behave as one superior to those whom he served. It is altogether wrong to have a superior attitude. Concerning this, we need to learn of the Lord. When He came as our Savior, He came to serve us as a slave. He was God’s Slave serving God’s redeemed ones. This is our example. If we keep this in mind, we shall be able to help the brothers properly for the long run. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="qrtD4k7nSUxKl3L1F9HYvF1a8nTDaWZnHU9tH7v7LVX2V0M-w6m_gV8s2EafX305n">2.

This signifies that at the time of revival the brother who is in debt to you spiritually will be released from you. <span class="pg" data-page-id="520" id="520">[520]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="8CNj27OFWN_6qC9vAuBiiMu1EbkdcYeypGMeEZeM8id7MXFWLRMGZ4VnbbcHB5Ro8"> Actually, we may not be able to help a younger brother or a weaker brother very much, but we may help him to remain in the church until the jubilee, a time of revival, comes to him. This revival brings in God’s sufficient and adequate grace to meet the brother’s need. </p>
<p data-content-id="0Mc2AjIjEcgnOIfYqSBXyGYDuncAlEwKUmlwVwYbl9P2sUtxfBsUTcI2aw4ETTmDP"> We should always remember that what we can do for others really does not mean very much. At most, we can help to maintain a situation. Paul says, “I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow; so that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One who makes to grow, God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40182" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:6-7">1 Cor. 3:6-7</span>). Here we see that neither the one who planted nor the one who watered could do anything to give life to those whom they served. God is the One who gives life. We, therefore, must learn the lesson of humility. Yes, we may do a lot, but not a lot can be accomplished. We may plant and water, but the plant will not grow unless God gives the growth. When God gives growth, there is a revival, a revival that brings in all the grace needed for the spiritual life. </p>
<p data-content-id="7KDrIgxvPeGxEknpu13p9NRNoL27EvFquTAbQrYdftQwur0W0NCp1o6e3TlKTMR6I"> Whether we shall be a profit to the church life or a loss depends on our motive, our spirit, and our attitude. In helping a weaker one, your attitude unconsciously may be that such a one is your servant or that he is beneath you. While he is under your care, he is actually under your bondage. Thus, the helped one is in bondage to the helping one. However, when a revival comes, the brother who has been in bondage to you will be released from your bondage. If you do not realize this today, eventually you will realize that the one whom you help may be in bondage to you and needs a jubilee, a spiritual revival, in order to be released from this bondage. </p>

<p data-content-id="qrtD4k7nSUxKl3L1F9HYvF1a9nTSQWZnHU9tH7v7LVX2V0M-w6m_gV8s2EafX305n"> According to our understanding, we may think that the book of Leviticus should end with the jubilee in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40196" data-verses="Leviticus 25:1">chapter twenty-five</span>. However, two chapters still remain. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40197" data-verses="Leviticus 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span> we have the word of warning, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40198" data-verses="Leviticus 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span>, the devotions concerning a vow. The fact that the chapter on the word of warning immediately follows the chapter on the jubilee indicates that, concerning the jubilee, we should not shout too much or be too excited. We need, instead, to have a sober mind to consider the situation. For this reason, the jubilee, a time of shouting, is followed by a word of warning. After this, there is an additional word, something like a postscript, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40199" data-verses="Leviticus 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span>. In this message we shall begin to consider the word of warning. </p>
<p data-content-id="yM17TXa3OJ3JFUKUJNaJ-Z-UNZGgq-2qoV1tbp_R_HyvijpCtI2f4lXHS5dhDfOiX"> The word of warning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40200" data-verses="Leviticus 26:1">Leviticus 26</span> is not merely a human speaking. No, the way of speaking, the contents, and everything related to this word are not simply human but are the divine oracle. Only God can speak this way, and only God can present a word of warning in such a way and with such contents, contents that are truly marvelous, full of facts and foretellings. </p>
<p data-content-id="8CNj27OFWN_6qC9vAuBiiMu1Fbk0UYeypGMeEZeM8id7MXFWLRMGZ4VnbbcHB5Ro8"> In this word of warning we can see the destiny of apostate Israel. Israel had been chosen by God from the time of Abraham, the first of their fathers. God later redeemed them out of Egypt, brought them through the wilderness, and placed them in the good land, where He was with them for quite a while. However, the people of Israel became apostate, and, in a sense, God gave them up. <span class="pg" data-page-id="528" id="528">[528]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="0Mc2AjIjEcgnOIfYqSBXyGYDvnctsEwKUmlwVwYbl9P2sUtxfBsUTcI2aw4ETTmDP"> God apparently took His hand off them and left them to themselves. It seems that for twenty-seven centuries the hand of God has been kept away from His people. Actually, this has not been the situation. In this word of warning there is a kind of prophecy pointing out that the God who had chosen Israel has never given them up. His mercy upon them has never stopped. Eventually, His mercy will come in to bring them back to their fathers’ land. </p>
<p data-content-id="N1UwjLbqomFsD8Hs1MzRwX784_DmxgZu-SP6P-yYnxUULR5dEvstQRid9lxUvJo_Y"> The word of warning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40201" data-verses="Leviticus 26:1">Leviticus 26</span> is full of instruction; it is full of things that we need to study and learn. However, in the two messages on this chapter I shall simply present the basic points, leaving the rest to the enlightening Spirit who, I believe, will speak to you. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tq7hKR37puDvUqPzDeSKSsLurC_vKUnOB1sQ10OAzaUm598D1pDdUeNiY98sV6D5J">I.

Not having idols, not making them or bowing down to them, signifies that besides God we should have no other goals that we are seeking after, that we may not lose the position to enjoy our divine possession. </p>
<p data-content-id="Uy7vFEnwR55XavTnTo3EqFJG2pHwDdfDirVdCYDVpVTdtZKnpVBJGlLm1pEB8cOAx"> We are in the jubilee. But if we seek something other than God, we may lose the enjoyment of the jubilee. Whatever we seek as a goal other than God is an idol. For example, we may pursue a college degree in such a way that it becomes an idol, a goal we are seeking other than God. This, of course, does not mean that we do not need a proper education. The point is that we should not make a degree a goal that we are seeking other than God Himself. We should have one goal, a unique goal—God as our one aim. </p>

This, however, is a hard lesson, for we have been taught to work and to do many things. This item teaches us not to work but to respect, enter into, and enjoy what God has done for us. Although Christ has accomplished everything for us, we may not be in the enjoyment of this achievement. Instead of enjoying what Christ has done, we may keep on laboring, setting Christ’s achievement aside. This is offensive to the Lord. Therefore, we need to learn to receive, regard, respect, and enjoy what God has done and not try to do something for ourselves. </p>

The sabbath stands for a lot, and the sanctuary stands for even more. Reverencing God’s sanctuary signifies that we should regard with reverence all that God is and has accomplished in Christ as His dwelling, embodiment, and expression (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40205" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40206" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>) and in the church as the enlargement of Christ for God’s dwelling and eternal manifestation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40207" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">Eph. 2:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40208" data-verses="Revelation 21:10">Rev. 21:10</span>). </p>

However, among Christians today these things are neglected, for many do not have the adequate knowledge of what God is in Christ as His embodiment and of what God has done in the church to make it the enlargement of Christ and the manifestation of God. Because neglecting these matters is against God’s economy, we need to be warned to regard them. </p>

Spiritual satisfaction and security are always the issue of our obedience to God’s warning. </p>

I will eliminate savage beasts from the land, and the sword will not pass through your land” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40217" data-verses="Leviticus 26:6">v. 6</span>). This signifies that the church is normally in a peaceful situation, having no savage beasts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40218" data-verses="Acts 20:29">Acts 20:29</span>) or fightings, one with another, among the saints. </p>

In this message I would like to give a further word on what was covered in the previous message. </p>

First, we should not have idols (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40236" data-verses="Leviticus 26:1">v. 1</span>). This signifies that besides God we should have no other goals that we are seeking after, so that we may not lose the position to enjoy our divine possession. Second, we should keep God’s sabbaths (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40237" data-verses="Leviticus 26:2">v. 2a</span>). This signifies that we should know that the work of God was done entirely by Himself that we might enjoy it, and that there is no need for us to do any work. Third, we need to reverence God’s sanctuary (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40238" data-verses="Leviticus 26:2">v. 2b</span>). This signifies that we should regard with reverence all that God is and has accomplished in Christ as God’s dwelling, embodiment, and expression (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40239" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40240" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>), and in the church as the enlargement of Christ for God’s dwelling and eternal manifestation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40241" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">Eph. 2:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40242" data-verses="Revelation 21:10">Rev. 21:10</span>). We need not only to understand these points in letter but also to see their intrinsic significance. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="OETCsjMBdqbNfrPdG1o4GALbNHAZAO7bMBYHie8kfs2o1Fr5FqXL4WjAzs30TDaPr">The Processed Triune God<br/>as Our Unique Goal</h2><p data-content-id="abOlojkYEV6S5Nyw1iDNLhoFUhZoXxNgoVyybWxTCvwbL9IKdQKnhKWGzjO26wOAP"> God Himself must be our unique goal. As His creatures and especially as His children, we should not seek anything <span class="pg" data-page-id="536" id="536">[536]</span> other than Him. He should be the unique goal after which we are seeking. </p>
<p data-content-id="bMciakEq1jnYyMA9zOc4fi_iDFB6z0kBRXyiszf2beiMhuuovJ4PBc3b8Pwvp8oTA"> Our God today is the processed Triune God. As such, He is not the same as He was in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40243" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>. God has been processed. This means that He has passed through many processes. He has passed through incarnation, through human living, through an all-inclusive death, and through a wonderful resurrection. Furthermore, He has entered into ascension. He has also descended to gain us and to enable us to gain Him, making Himself one with us and making us one with Him and constituting us with Him. This is a matter of the mingling of the processed Triune God with us. Today this processed Triune God should be our unique goal. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="qrtD4k7nSUxKl3L1F9HYvF1W0nTPYWZnHU9tH7v7LVX2V0M-w6m_gV8s2EafX305n">The Work God Has Accomplished for Our Rest</h2><p data-content-id="yM17TXa3OJ3JFUKUJNaJ-Z-YEZG5j-2qoV1tbp_R_HyvijpCtI2f4lXHS5dhDfOiX"> The second item in the basis of our obedience is realizing what God has done. This means that we should take God’s work and rest because of it. However, most people neglect God’s work and, instead, try to do something for themselves and by themselves. This is the situation among believers as well as unbelievers. Many believers ignore what God’s work has accomplished for them and work by themselves to accomplish something for themselves. But it is an insult to God to ignore what He has done for us that we may rest in Him and in His work. To rest in God and in His work is to keep His sabbath. </p>
<p data-content-id="8CNj27OFWN_6qC9vAuBiiMu5MbkRaYeypGMeEZeM8id7MXFWLRMGZ4VnbbcHB5Ro8"> We may ignore God’s work and seek to do something for ourselves and by ourselves under the cloak of doing something for God. Such a thing may have a good appearance, but it is actually an insult to God, for it ignores what He has done for us that we may rest in Him and enjoy what He has done for us. Instead of ignoring what God has done, we should deny what we can do or want to do. We need to deny our work but honor God’s work and rest in Him. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="0Mc2AjIjEcgnOIfYqSBXyGYPmncMjEwKUmlwVwYbl9P2sUtxfBsUTcI2aw4ETTmDP">The Result of God’s Work</h2><p data-content-id="7KDrIgxvPeGxEknpu13p9NRBgL23GvFquTAbQrYdftQwur0W0NCp1o6e3TlKTMR6I"> The basis for our obedience is first God Himself and then God’s work. Now we come to the third item in the basis for <span class="pg" data-page-id="537" id="537">[537]</span> our obedience, and this is the result of God’s work. What is the result, the issue, of God’s work? In brief, it is the church as the enlargement of the consummated Christ to be God’s dwelling, God’s embodiment, God’s expression, and God’s eternal manifestation. This is the church, and such a church is the result, the issue, the produce, of God’s work. </p>
<p data-content-id="_WsCu0UVGd8o3Q6ZANIAJepBmWd9O7Zx5OwRVVx1PunU7kpT6WA8gEA6LgK96lE05"> These three matters—God, God’s work, and the result of God’s work—are covered fully in the sixty-six books of the Bible. In the Old Testament we see the types, and in the New Testament we see the fulfillment. The entire Bible is thus an unveiling of these three things. First we have the processed Triune God and His work for our rest, and then, as the result of His work, we have the church as the expression and the enlargement of the consummated Christ. We need to see this. Seeing these three things will give us a strong basis for obeying, going along with, God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="BbO8eSfTx5R84H_f9kv8JKRJnG3T8cqg7Rva48wPNAlxcvoNCVQHbME6iRkopNA5y">Honoring the Processed Triune God</h2><p data-content-id="xpuW_vPofBGDzDc22724t8RSY5jna0BSr8301X99RY97AKbZvApQctIkumW21xaSQ"> We may talk about obeying God without knowing what it really means to obey God. To obey God is to honor Him as the processed Triune God. In eternity God was perfect, but He still needed to pass through a process in order to be consummated. Some think that if we speak this way about God, we do not reverence Him. Actually, it is to honor Him. In eternity past God was perfect, but He was not complete. Before His incarnation, God had divinity, but He did not have humanity. But after He became a man, He had humanity as well as divinity. Today our God is not merely God with divinity; He is the God-man with both divinity and humanity. He is Jesus and Emmanuel. In the name <em>Jesus</em> we can see the holy name <em>Jehovah,</em> for the name Jesus means “Jehovah the Savior.” Jesus is also Emmanuel, which means “God with us.” Hence, in the name <em>Emmanuel</em> we can see both God and man. From this we see that our God today is the God-man; He is of both divinity and humanity. He is divinely human and humanly divine. </p>
<p data-content-id="rCeQBKNuXLnpxNKjpL-6rcv6RmEC_HB5ztp7_KErmZE1m7T-GugDdoJ0xk-AO9IMP"> When God became a man. He did not set His Godhead aside. No, Jesus lived by God and with God; He lived in <span class="pg" data-page-id="538" id="538">[538]</span> oneness with God. As He said, He was never alone because the Father was always with Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40244" data-verses="John 16:32">John 16:32</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40245" data-verses="John 8:29">8:29</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="dUhqhQwKWbXKSbqvLKXmrZOLu6ObM9A-m0V4pRJtqQPpDGovAqJWJcKK1hwOATnaE"> Because Jesus was a man with God in Him and one with Him, He was a mystery, even to His disciples. They knew He was human, for they had seen Him eat and also weep. But although He was a man, He did marvelous things, things which no man was able to do. Hence, the disciples must have wondered about Him, asking themselves who He was. One day He asked them, “Who do you say that I am?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40246" data-verses="Matthew 16:15">Matt. 16:15</span>). As the One with divinity and humanity, He is a wonderful person; He is altogether a mystery. Our God today is such a God. </p>
<p data-content-id="QrptJJxnlubdylPzgsOm36q0A-PLwLPyv1OlLurgtE73Y3Ur-McK8L5I1R7Ma9Rtr"> When Moses received from God the word of warning that was to be given to the children of Israel, he did not know God as the One who had been processed. At that time God was only the perfect God; He had not yet been completed. But the God we know today is different from the God Moses knew. This certainly does not mean that there are two Gods. No, there is one God, but He is in two stages. Moses knew God at the stage when He was only God without being a man. However, we worship God not only as God but also as the God-man. There is a Man in heaven, and this Man is the very God. This is our God, the God of the Christians. </p>
<p data-content-id="Kbr2zMFu7prMv589VrFoje5SL-WzcbKZ7yQ9bjy8JdXHTAd4mjuWZo9eiEivMyu1q"> Some Christians may not realize that their God is the God-man who has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. After He became incarnate, He lived on earth as the God-man, as God in a man, for thirty-three and a half years. He lived in a carpenter’s home in the despised town of Nazareth. He worked as a carpenter Himself, and in history some have even referred to Him as the Carpenter of Nazareth. He was a carpenter, but He was also the very God. It is almost unimaginable that God was in a man doing the work of carpentry. </p>
<p data-content-id="lo2rhE_cgAMwRI2ZJVIpYWqnxpSbn6e5Meoawkyfbmb_iVgZMNNND2h_d1VBdUhRD"> For thirty-three and a half years the Lord Jesus lived on earth as a wonderful man who was the expression of God. Having passed through the process of human living, He passed through the process of death. He was buried in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="539" id="539">[539]</span> tomb, and He entered into Hades, where He remained for a period of time. All this was part of the process of death. </p>

<p data-content-id="Eo8_f6xczFEz8Dhy4DUKmRXdudtyIuIMuEdkcPMoX47E1B39u_MgRBsuwxjcPeLGZ"> According to the word of warning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40251" data-verses="Leviticus 26:1">Leviticus 26</span>, the obeying ones will be blessed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40252" data-verses="Leviticus 26:3-13">vv. 3-13</span>), but the disobeying ones will be chastised that they may repent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40253" data-verses="Leviticus 26:14-39">vv. 14-39</span>). This chastisement is on five levels. As we have seen, the first level is the appointing of sudden terror (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40254" data-verses="Leviticus 26:14-17">vv. 14-17</span>). This terror comprises both a consuming disease and a fever and also being defeated by the enemies. The chastisement on the second level is a matter of being disciplined sevenfold, with the heavens being made like iron, giving no rain, and the earth being made like brass, yielding no produce (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40255" data-verses="Leviticus 26:18-20">vv. 18-20</span>). In this message we shall go on to see the chastisement on the other three levels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40256" data-verses="Leviticus 26:21-39">vv. 21-39</span>) and then the repentance of the people and the remembrance of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40257" data-verses="Leviticus 26:40-45">vv. 40-45</span>). </p>

These plagues signify troubles among the believers in the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40260" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:11">1 Cor. 1:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40261" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:20">2 Cor. 12:20</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="542" id="542">[542]</span> </p>

This signifies that in the church fierce people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40263" data-verses="Acts 20:29">Acts 20:29</span>) will rise up to bereave the believers of their life produce, to destroy their spiritual possessions, to reduce their number, and to desolate their communications. </p>

This signifies that in the church there will be fightings among the brothers. Fightings among the brothers is a sign of God’s chastisement. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="wC5_UtyIRPyB7WpxJOJXBMKWGb92GCN8AU3cnMbGoPMp8MiDs1CTFLNSZcpsTXlfK">2.

This signifies that in the church there will be some kind of contagious disease. The “germs” of this disease are spread mainly through gossip and vain talk. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="mqLFmiP5_8OCpZzE87Nge8scjJOFfmqJWkZYIFBzM8DlynnVp33_qIBdunbYlLH9U">3.

This signifies that the believers in the church will be taken over by the enemy. During my history in the church life, I have seen such a thing happen a few times. <span class="pg" data-page-id="543" id="543">[543]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="AX99LAoSSDDp0sZ8GP9dslCqhGowqDOOXlVaDXIcuoHkKGg7wn__7mL30AgWcce-r">4. Cutting Off the Supply of Bread<br/>So That It Will Be Delivered by Weight<br/>and People Will Not Be Satisfied</h2><p data-content-id="Fv8eruG2C4An5ussdVnkAb4My9j1cBFRCDYUBaT7z4c3XGWu7IZmTcTRA2UgLmbJe"> “When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they will deliver again your bread by weight; and you will eat and not be satisfied” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40267" data-verses="Leviticus 26:26">v. 26</span>). This signifies that in the church the spiritual supply will be cut off to a greatly reduced amount, so that there will be no satisfaction for the believers. We also have seen this happen in the church life. In a certain church there was a long period of time when there was no distribution of the spiritual food supply. As a result, in that church there was starvation. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="CmWO4n8XWbzptjiYJJrutWLlJtwePtdWPFMX_iz9FQow2HICWW0e_sbr39oUdQ53H">E.

Eating the Flesh of Their Children</h2><p data-content-id="pOQyt1gjzS1vZpd150kJXgoGVoVhfeJdrM5O10orBdv0cPWAhLe2gIJMOqxTtjK6d"> “And you will eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters you will eat” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40269" data-verses="Leviticus 26:29">v. 29</span>). This signifies that the church becomes so poor that it is unable to satisfy its members but bereaves them of their food supply. In such a situation the shortage of the food supply reaches the extent of there being nothing to eat except the “children,” that is, what the church members produced in the past. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="vSQYV8H55L1lGrY7ZUxst6hjnhsu6mieBZUCxoEnjcViCSP5VYMPeX6RAh2edvmD6">2.

This signifies that the fleshly churches place themselves as carcasses upon the goals other than God that were sought by them as idols and destroyed by God. Here we see that in such a church God comes in to destroy both the idols and those who <span class="pg" data-page-id="544" id="544">[544]</span> worship them. In such a church there is nothing but a heap of carcasses. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="2RckI5Ct4Iw0lfg0o-7qXnsMaetGGcK0dqFXHy3GZc1Qzj85J-8LmfOv-1xMzMlJ0">3.

This signifies that the churches are laid waste and their worship is desolated, and there is no satisfaction as a fragrance to God. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="f1SdNSV-jnmqSNmLFj2KduKiElcTBoF0g5vVSa13IQ9kvvIAb-D_3fsbMnQfG6L1R">4.

This signifies that the church’s enjoyment of Christ as the rich land is desolated and stolen by the enemies. In such a church there is no longer the enjoyment of Christ, for this enjoyment has been stolen by the enemy. A church in which this happens is a church which has lost the enjoyment of Christ to the uttermost. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="HomP821jsfmQ8p43kMxD4q8yS34rsTThflkEC69_mme9_M6bdRalURihY94i1Wws0">5.

The unsheathed sword signifies God’s death-judgment. The people being scattered among the nations and chased by the unsheathed sword signifies that the church is scattered among the Gentiles and driven by the death-judgment of God. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="k1b_-LdFaDzH5eTjPaqBvcmXrKHQjaDHUrgPD1q4xSXGU2fRRcrs_GWJkW-01a5uN">6.

All the days that it lies desolate it will keep a sabbath, a sabbath which it did not keep in your sabbaths, when you lived upon it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40274" data-verses="Leviticus 26:34-35">vv. 34-35</span>). The land enjoying its sabbath during their captivity signifies that the church’s enjoyment of Christ as the rich land lies waste after the believers are scattered among the Gentiles. Thus far in my church life, I have not seen this kind of situation. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="zLs19c8l0fJmVCIlaXT2eNrW37Rgwxx4r18qhLGRHCQGX8rX56yBc-Lf9eVsYHyhn">7. In the Enemies’ Lands Faintness<br/>Being Sent into the Hearts, the People<br/>Being Driven and Fleeing as though<br/>Fleeing from the Sword, Stumbling over<br/>One Another, Perishing among the Nations<br/> Being Consumed and Rotting<br/>in the Land of Their Enemies</h2><p data-content-id="abOlojkYEV6S5Nyw1iDNLhoFVhZgfxNgoVyybWxTCvwbL9IKdQKnhKWGzjO26wOAP"> “And as for those of you who are left, I will send faintness into their hearts in the land of their enemies, so that the sound of a driven leaf will chase them, and they will flee as though fleeing from the sword, and they will fall when no one pursues. They will stumble over one another as if before the sword, though no one pursues, and you will not be able to stand before your enemies. You will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies will consume you. Those of you who are left will rot away in their iniquity in the lands of your enemies; and also because of the iniquities of their fathers, they will rot away like them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40275" data-verses="Leviticus 26:36-39">vv. 36-39</span>). This signifies that the church in its captivity is under suffering and is eventually consumed by the enemies. This is the conclusion of the divine chastisement, a chastisement which in four of its levels is sevenfold. For chastisement to be sevenfold means that it is intensified. </p>

<p data-content-id="MPOCDFUKm8cVcjpGd7ROS35663MXWGrsW0PImFA2Wzbc3DwzZLz1gDLcK7CSHAOA3"> In this message we come to the last chapter of Leviticus, a chapter concerning the devotions for a vow. </p>
<p data-content-id="V7B55sygWuttI4KoZ4bOSqhw0H8Bec2BybMHU3NWuBbXmv0xQiUlyWnEa-JNV4Dll"> The book of Leviticus concludes with a vow which we need to have with God. After the twenty-six foregoing chapters, in which many things are covered, this book speaks in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40285" data-verses="Leviticus 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> about our making a vow to God. This vow is of four kinds of devotions: the devotion of a person, the devotion of cattle, the devotion of a house, and the devotion of a part of a field. These four kinds of devotions surely express what God wants from us, the persons who have enjoyed all the blessings and all the visitations in the foregoing chapters. </p>
<p data-content-id="ivxFinYAwLQi2teoWLAO0sXMjaEr38tRoutdjeTon_4zq6XLkUjUpOe_VDOm3Pn7t"> In the first section of this book, we have seen the offerings with the priesthood. The offerings refer to Christ, and the priesthood indicates the body of priestly service that takes care of the offerings. In the second section we have seen our condition, which is a matter of uncleanness and unclean discharge. After seeing our condition, we were brought into the enjoyment of the feasts, and this leads us into the jubilee. Then we received a warning. Now, at the end of Leviticus, we need a vow. </p>
<p data-content-id="187ceXh_NbRnYyu1mrKM_o0rZxjosDgQKRD-2KHDg7OF95AMtokSZlUzK2LV54vgN"> Actually, the Christian life should be a life of a vow. I believe that within the heart of every saved one there is, to some extent, a vow to God. This vow may be evident or it may not be evident; it may be strong or it may be rather weak. Nevertheless, there is some kind of vow within every saved one. At least there is a desire which may result in a <span class="pg" data-page-id="550" id="550">[550]</span> vow. The desire toward God is the source, and this desire results in a vow to God. Our desire toward God eventually becomes a vow made to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="BbO8eSfTx5R84H_f9kv8JKRJlG3T0cqg7Rva48wPNAlxcvoNCVQHbME6iRkopNA5y"> On our part, the Christian life is a life of making a vow to God. This should happen not only once but again and again. Every time we experienced a revival, we made a vow to God. Now every morning when we are revived we make a kind of vow to God. Therefore, our Christian life is a life of a vow. </p>
<p data-content-id="xpuW_vPofBGDzDc22724t8RSa5jnS0BSr8301X99RY97AKbZvApQctIkumW21xaSQ"> Leviticus concludes with devotions for a vow. The totality of all the things in this book is a vow. When we add together the offerings, the priesthood, our condition, our enjoyment of Christ, and the jubilee, the sum, the total, is a vow. This vow then becomes our life, our living. The Levitical living, therefore, is the living of a vow. </p>
<p data-content-id="rCeQBKNuXLnpxNKjpL-6rcv6TmEO9HB5ztp7_KErmZE1m7T-GugDdoJ0xk-AO9IMP"> The book of Leviticus begins with our offering of Christ in many aspects to God for the satisfaction of both God and man, and it ends with our devoting ourselves and our possessions to God for our vow to Him. But what does the word <em>devote</em> mean? What does it mean to say that we devote ourselves to God? Some may think that devote is the same as to offer or to consecrate. According to my understanding, to devote is stronger than to offer or to consecrate; it is also stronger than to give, to present, to yield, and to surrender. A devotion must always go with a vow. Something may be offered or given without a vow being involved; but if something is given to a person in a will, that is a kind of devotion with a vow. Such a devotion cannot be changed.

This signifies that our devotion related to the enjoyment of Christ as the rich land should be valued according to the seed of the divine life required for our spiritual increase. </p>
<p data-content-id="mqLFmiP5_8OCpZzE87Nge8schJOFXmqJWkZYIFBzM8DlynnVp33_qIBdunbYlLH9U"> A field sanctified, devoted, to Jehovah was to be valued according to the seed required. Suppose a piece of land was devoted thirty-five years before the jubilee. For each of these thirty-five years a certain amount of seed would be required. The value of this piece of land would be higher than a piece of land devoted only twenty years before the jubilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZFdhXfV0GtQ7ozQy5uEoF65336rkMlqjdVAMW6C4PfTWSUVAOgHKQM3Y0B8x6f0De"> In our interpretation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40316" data-verses="Leviticus 27:16">verse 16</span>, we speak of our devotion related to the enjoyment of Christ. The land typifies Christ. However, we should not interpret <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40317" data-verses="Leviticus 27:16">verse 16</span> as typifying the devoting of a part of Christ. Such an interpretation is neither meaningful nor logical. Although we cannot devote a part of Christ or devote our enjoyment of Christ, we can <span class="pg" data-page-id="558" id="558">[558]</span> have a devotion that is related to the enjoyment of Christ. The three previous devotions—of ourselves, of our cattle, and of our houses—are all for us to enjoy Christ. The more we have these three kinds of devotions, the more we shall be in a position to enjoy Christ. Therefore, this chapter concludes that all our devotions consummate in the enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="AX99LAoSSDDp0sZ8GP9dslCqjGo8oDOOXlVaDXIcuoHkKGg7wn__7mL30AgWcce-r"> Our devotion related to the enjoyment of Christ should be valued according to the seed of the divine life required for our spiritual increase. In the type, the more seed required, the higher was the value of the land. The valuation was according to the seed required for the period of time before the jubilee. In our spiritual interpretation of this, “according to the seed required” actually denotes the prospect. Suppose I devote something for the enjoyment of Christ as the good land. How should this devotion be valued? This devotion should be valued according to its prospect. The greater the seed required, the greater is the prospect for increase. The lesser the seed required, the lesser is the prospect for the increase of the number in the church. If our devotion related to the enjoyment of Christ will afford a greater prospect for the increase of the church, this devotion will be more valuable. However, if our devotion, our consecration, will afford only a limited prospect for increase, our devotion will not be as valuable as one that affords a greater prospect. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fv8eruG2C4An5ussdVnkAb4Mw9j5aBFRCDYUBaT7z4c3XGWu7IZmTcTRA2UgLmbJe"> Perhaps you are wondering why we interpret <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40318" data-verses="Leviticus 27:16">verse 16</span> this way. The reason for this interpretation is the fact that seed is for increase. On the one hand, the seed indicates the value of the land. On the other hand, spiritually speaking, the seed indicates the life increase; it indicates multiplication. We may consecrate ourselves to the Lord, but our consecration may not afford very much prospect of the increase of the church. If our consecration affords a greater prospect of the increase of the church, surely this consecration will be more valuable than one that does not have such a prospect. Let us take Paul as an example. When Paul <span class="pg" data-page-id="559" id="559">[559]</span> devoted himself for the enjoyment of Christ, that devotion had a great prospect of the increase of the church. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="CmWO4n8XWbzptjiYJJrutWLlLtwSJtdWPFMX_iz9FQow2HICWW0e_sbr39oUdQ53H">2. The Valuation to Be Also according to<br/>the Number of Years from the Jubilee</h2><p data-content-id="PuyO3Sd3rtHDCrlUqHprqNkOrrIA7ZNKJnWiDhMvDB-DvcclyKQkDsf8ThJYtKq9k"> “If he sanctifies his field from the year of jubilee, it shall stand according to the valuation; but if he sanctifies his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall calculate the money for it according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee, and it shall be deducted from the valuation” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40319" data-verses="Leviticus 27:17-18">vv. 17-18</span>). The longer the time before the jubilee, the greater was the value of the devoted land. This signifies that our devotion related to the enjoyment of Christ should be valued also according to the measure of God’s grace from the jubilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="-PeHukwbm9F9hxNjtJPlj6vw--HFEXPXqV79a6e9f-uRqp0PM1xtx1OvvtRGpg6pH"> In these verses we have two ways of valuation: according to the seed required and according to the number of years from the jubilee. Actually, these two ways are one. The greater the number of years before the jubilee, the greater would be the seed required. The lesser the number of years, the lesser would be the seed required. </p>
<p data-content-id="pOQyt1gjzS1vZpd150kJXgoGXoVtReJdrM5O10orBdv0cPWAhLe2gIJMOqxTtjK6d"> Paul’s consecration afforded a larger prospect of the increase of the church. Paul’s consecration also provided him a great opportunity to enjoy the grace of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="vSQYV8H55L1lGrY7ZUxst6hjlhsi0mieBZUCxoEnjcViCSP5VYMPeX6RAh2edvmD6"> The more increase we bring in, the more grace we have a share in. The more increase our consecration affords, the more grace we enjoy. This is related to the number of years. If we devote ourselves to the Lord early in life, we shall have more years to bring sinners to the Lord and thus to contribute to the increase of the church. This increase will then indicate that we have enjoyed the Lord’s grace. The amount of grace is measured by the amount of increase. The greater the increase, the greater is the grace, and the lesser the increase, the lesser is the grace. This realization urges us to devote ourselves earlier—the earlier, the better. For example, if you have waited until now to preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes, you will afford less prospect of increase than if you had begun last year but more than if you wait until next year. This indicates that the earlier you <span class="pg" data-page-id="560" id="560">[560]</span> devote yourself to gospel preaching the better. Preaching the gospel will help you to enjoy Christ. You may enjoy the Lord in the morning by pray-reading a few verses, but you will have more enjoyment of Christ if you preach the gospel by visiting people. To visit people with the gospel requires a certain amount of devotion. As we devote ourselves, our time, and our energy to preaching the gospel, we shall be helped to enjoy the Lord more. This kind of devotion to preaching the gospel consummates not only in people being saved but also in our enjoyment of Christ. The principle is the same with participating in home meetings to nourish the new ones. </p>
<p data-content-id="WlA3awOYhU9znfuKt6dvGiqwWUYwA0tfDhtg3P_T8AseHPoPSWYPV6PMcXDqPbKl8"> The point I wish to emphasize here is this: The more we devote ourselves to the Lord in anything, the more we are related to the enjoyment of Christ. The amount, the degree, the level, of the enjoyment of Christ is figured by the seed required and by the number of years to the jubilee. The seed required indicates the prospect of increase to the Body. The greater the seed required, the greater will be the increase we shall bring in for the Body. The greater the number of years to the jubilee, the greater will be the grace for our enjoyment. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="2RckI5Ct4Iw0lfg0o-7qXnsMYetGOcK0dqFXHy3GZc1Qzj85J-8LmfOv-1xMzMlJ0">3. The Sanctifying One Who Redeemed<br/>the Field Was to Add One-fifth of the Valuation</h2><p data-content-id="ugJdCXLu0ey6qT0teoiBGH7EEsyqaqFo8Xz3Iczpu7TrQaSjH1QUlKlNLKEP00tlJ"> “And if he who sanctified the field would indeed redeem it, then he shall add to it one-fifth of the valuation in money, and it shall remain his” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40320" data-verses="Leviticus 27:19">v. 19</span>). This signifies that we should pay a price for our devotion related to the enjoyment of Christ as the rich land. </p>
<p data-content-id="f1SdNSV-jnmqSNmLFj2KduKiGlcXDoF0g5vVSa13IQ9kvvIAb-D_3fsbMnQfG6L1R"> If we have devoted something and we want to get it back, we have to pay the price. If we do not devote, there is no need to redeem or to pay anything. In such a case, nothing is added to our enjoyment of Christ. But if we devote and we want to reclaim what is devoted, we have to pay the price and then add one-fifth of that price. The important matter here is not the amount added to the price—it is getting ourselves involved with the enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="IcDSKk0-zyd2G7hWO-1B3c8i-IzrhjtjBspMyxBYA_3Aefgwi8mVa14ggFd5zUntv"> Whether we are right or wrong, it is good to devote. As <span class="pg" data-page-id="561" id="561">[561]</span> long as we devote, we are involved with and related to the enjoyment of Christ. In the past I knew quite a number of saints who consecrated themselves to the Lord in a wrong way, but they all became involved with the enjoyment of Christ. </p>

Now, in this concluding word, I would like to consider six matters that are the main points in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40341" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">chapters eleven through twenty-seven</span> of Leviticus. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-PeHukwbm9F9hxNjtJPlj6vw5-HUJXPXqV79a6e9f-uRqp0PM1xtx1OvvtRGpg6pH">OUR SITUATION</h2><p data-content-id="pOQyt1gjzS1vZpd150kJXgoGQoVwTeJdrM5O10orBdv0cPWAhLe2gIJMOqxTtjK6d"> The first five chapters of this section of Leviticus unveil our situation. According to these chapters, our contact with others may be unclean, and our source, our origin, is uncleanness. Furthermore, our condition is one of leprosy, and whatever comes out of us as a discharge is unclean. This is our situation as it is clearly unveiled to us in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40342" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">chapters eleven through fifteen</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vSQYV8H55L1lGrY7ZUxst6hjihs73mieBZUCxoEnjcViCSP5VYMPeX6RAh2edvmD6">CHRIST’S REDEMPTION</h2><p data-content-id="WlA3awOYhU9znfuKt6dvGiqwRUYZK0tfDhtg3P_T8AseHPoPSWYPV6PMcXDqPbKl8"> The second main point is Christ’s redemption. Instead of the word <em>redemption,</em> the word used in Leviticus is <em>propitiation.</em> Christ’s redemption, His propitiation, has solved our problems and has brought us back to God. We have not only been redeemed back to God and brought into His presence—we have been brought into God Himself. Now we are in the consummated Triune God, and here, in Him, we have full enjoyment. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2RckI5Ct4Iw0lfg0o-7qXnsMfetrFcK0dqFXHy3GZc1Qzj85J-8LmfOv-1xMzMlJ0">THE ENJOYMENT OF THE RICHES<br/>OF THE PROCESSED AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="4mdq3y0cOc3Dr86Vjcerq3ewoY40HYlfe9OOpxJJ8hAcXLR1eihN1Srq4IoiphC0s"> Having been brought back to God and into God by Christ’s redemption, we may now enjoy all the riches of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="568" id="568">[568]</span> processed and consummated Triune God. This is fully revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40343" data-verses="Leviticus 23:1">Leviticus 23</span>, a chapter that speaks of the seven feasts, which are seven festivals for our enjoyment of all the riches of our God. It is in God Himself that we have the enjoyment of His riches. By enjoying the riches of the processed and consummated Triune God, we become His expression. This means that we become the Body of Christ as the enlargement of Christ to express Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="o5HGAna4E3UbMG7NGiSbaPlxWm3RuYoLI3dKIr2iVbybx3hEM_7DGG6BX7Kk3dEPS">THE JUBILEE</h2><p data-content-id="3lBTmaq9moHRumeUlLI0z9-tabb9IhxeMZAEbbLWdHR7eQxL9TMP84tRESuFndxAt"> Our enjoyment of the riches of the processed and consummated Triune God brings us to the fourth point—the jubilee. The jubilee is the completion and the consummation of our enjoyment of the riches of the Triune God in God Himself. When we enjoy the Triune God in all His riches and when we have this enjoyment in the Triune God Himself, we will reach the jubilee, which will be for eternity. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="G8WifseOG75eXksZ0Xg3wn7QdetEB8YfLcO9OTK3bDlF2oEvqaaac2VQzRzH11-xg">THREE CRUCIAL ITEMS</h2><p data-content-id="cEGQRZcEFdiSW_luPEGi_zubi8CLYnBiAywbXPclmSQESewfF2_kdR7dnAPblMLTy"> The fifth point is our realization that three items are crucial to us. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="YDsRD7ifPw-lp8lc5xue-re1yPbMJOgMuQ4KkOc2H7hurUt1fU4NGccyn3CnOpDOB">God as Our Unique Goal</h2><p data-content-id="Eo8_f6xczFEz8Dhy4DUKmRXdrdtvEuIMuEdkcPMoX47E1B39u_MgRBsuwxjcPeLGZ"> God Himself should be our unique goal, our unique aim. Apart from Him we should not have any other goal. We should not seek anything other than God. Our goal is the Triune God processed, completed, and consummated to be our full enjoyment. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="DAXcbsbzMAWBUrvVTy0dqdzaT2I0d5ymf8MzGShj-RTqJixX3OkvHHtouXshNnro9">Respecting God’s Completed Work</h2><p data-content-id="Slkwfbwd8WAXYyyQY7UU1NsAww2jbLyLwR1_r8BaVpq62ItkpbBUwNo3LENsEhxaS"> We all need to respect God’s completed work, the work that God has accomplished for our interest and for our rest. God’s work has been accomplished, and it has been accomplished for our rest. Therefore, we need to regard God Himself and His work for our interest. </p>
<p data-content-id="ge3wnxIwGxa4rrtSyd1Wi9T7yOsAo5UCxwpTMeqQUEqdRe-NF0C2fsGQOIKlAT22Z"> God’s work has a result, and this result is His enlargement, His extension. This enlargement is the Body of Christ, which is the mingling of the processed Triune God and His <span class="pg" data-page-id="569" id="569">[569]</span> chosen and redeemed people as one entity. This entity is God’s dwelling, God’s embodiment, and God’s expression. Eventually, it will be God’s manifestation in eternity. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ehZiAV472AzUxzKg22tugFXUlhYFl3FEbtMfczCI5c6oYys5LccddxEzqypM7CPIR">Obeying God</h2><p data-content-id="5c5lLvOTxKbegnfVCkujIZCMwiZ2P8xQJy4GzCHBtPSGykqXudXnQpZPgRpmmqveb"> Based upon the fact of having God as our unique goal and regarding His completed work, we obey God. To obey God simply means to go along with God. To obey God is to agree with all that He is and with all that He has accomplished. When we obey God, we agree with God and with His work. We also agree with the result of God’s work, which is His enlargement. When we agree with God and go along with Him, we spontaneously obey Him, and by obeying Him we receive His rich blessing. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="N1UwjLbqomFsD8Hs1MzRwX7w1_DqzgZu-SP6P-yYnxUULR5dEvstQRid9lxUvJo_Y">MAKING A VOW</h2><p data-content-id="tq7hKR37puDvUqPzDeSKSsLimC_jIUnOB1sQ10OAzaUm598D1pDdUeNiY98sV6D5J"> Finally, we need to see that there is the need for those who are willing and able to enjoy God, to enjoy God’s work, and to enjoy the result of God’s work. If we would be those who enjoy God, God’s work, and the result of God’s work, we need to respond to God’s desire by making a vow. Our response to God’s desire that we be His enjoyers should not be ordinary but particular. This means that it should be a vow. We need to make a vow in which we tell God that we shall enjoy Him according to what is revealed in the book of Leviticus. We should tell Him that we want to enjoy Him by regarding Him, by respecting His work, and by honoring the result of His work. This is a vow to enjoy the processed, completed, and consummated Triune God. This Triune God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is one with His Body, which is His expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="huE1la_VvhqT-E_rMeCC-1onCtVnVjHXdPzx2sbNshy0olh7DO3UOWL5zObECuN3-"> We all need to regard God, His work, and the result of His work, go along with Him, and become those who enjoy Him. For this, we have to respond to God by making a vow. Are you willing to do this? Let us all make such a vow today. </p>
