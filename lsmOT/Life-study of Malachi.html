Although the Lord Jesus enacted the new covenant nearly two thousand years ago, generally speaking the Jewish people have not benefitted by it. Instead, the benefit has gone to the Gentiles. However, when Christ comes back, He will come as the Angel of the covenant to execute His covenant over the repentant and believing Jews. At that time they will become beneficiaries of the new covenant. </p>

In His first coming He is the Messenger of God. As the Messenger of God, Christ not only brings a word or a message from God to God’s people; He Himself is the living message. This is fully proved by the four Gospels, which are a complete and perfect record of Christ as the living message sent by God to His chosen people. While the Lord Jesus was living on earth, as He traveled through the cities and as He spoke to the people, ministering Himself into the intrinsic part of their being, He Himself was the message. </p>

<p data-content-id="taETZnJ3Lg9yCjwqezVr6cewZzuorz8uCHKbtxK_DVqE8ZJeIt3sZbHzngxr7xLoI"> In His second coming, Christ will be the Angel of the covenant, the Desire of nations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61141" data-verses="Malachi 3:1">3:1</span>), and the Sun of righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61142" data-verses="Malachi 4:2">4:2</span>). Actually, Christ was the Angel of the covenant even in His first coming. As the Angel of the covenant, Christ enacted the new covenant. Before going to the cross, the last thing He did was to establish the new covenant at His table (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61143" data-verses="Matthew 26:26-30">Matt. 26:26-30</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> </p>

God is then able to dispense Himself into our intrinsic being to be our life, to be the law of life, and to be everything to us as our inward content that we may live Him. This means that the new covenant is to make us absolutely one with God. He becomes us, and we, being constituted with Him, are one with Him in His life and nature. The New Testament reveals that He and we form a mutual abode (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61145" data-verses="John 14:20">John 14:20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61146" data-verses="John 14:23">23</span>). What a miracle this is! </p>
<p data-content-id="MGamYGK6DgOuxLtPaqALHeNFzH7-rKPal6pRT017Q5DOmmX1aPAt48NuXJWFI3HSK"> We need to have the proper understanding of what it means to say that God has been constituted into us to become us and that we have become one with God in His life and nature. The New Testament reveals that God is our Father and that we are His sons. We are not sons who have been adopted by God but sons who have been born of God. God is our Father because He has begotten us, and we are His sons because we have been born of Him. Just as a child shares the life and nature of his father but not the fatherhood, so we as sons born of God share God’s life and nature but not His fatherhood nor His Godhead. We are the same as God our Father in life and nature, but we surely are not God in His Godhead or the Father in His fatherhood. This is the intrinsic revelation of the Bible, especially of the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="VkAt8iqTi7o3w2Yf9F_zTk3nRwfFkmzN4G1_fXczvBfsi-9CLhf5JN9tKQYpVaEGt"> In our daily living, we need to remember our status as sons of God possessing the life and nature of God. For example, if a brother and his wife both realize this, knowing that they are not only human but also divine, they will respect each other to the uttermost. Instead of disputing, they will honor each other and be kind to each other. Also, this realization will keep them from losing their temper. When we are tempted to lose our temper, we need to remember that we are sons of God. Even in such a matter as shopping in a department store, we should not forget our status as sons of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="11" id="11">[11]</span> </p>

Christ is the One whom we desire. Day by day we desire Him to be our love, our humility, our meekness, and our joy. Nothing is better than joy. This joy becomes our strength, our healing, our feeding, and our nourishment. Real joy comes from Christ being our life, our virtues, and our everything. I can testify that I have been loving this One for over seventy years, and I love Him today much more than ever. Daily I desire Him, love Him, and consider Him. He surely is our Desire. </p>

Today the Pentecostal people practice what is called divine healing. Actually, Christ Himself is our healing. He is the Sun that heals us as it shines upon us. </p>
<p data-content-id="TP9etqpzg4cWBSsYPU9S7ZWXGq2zIhRpDQpHHRqfcirpEr-3mB92-JSgO-xG1ojZN"> In His first coming, the earth rejected Christ; therefore, the earth lacks His healing. But because we have received Him in a secret, hidden way, we receive His healing every day. His healing causes us to have joy so that we forget our anger and anxiety. We are sick from sin, death, and many deficiencies and imperfections. Only this healing Christ can make us whole. To be healed is to be saved. To be healed, to be saved, is to be made whole. He will heal us, but we must give Him the freedom to use His wings to fly above us, around us, and within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="nqDKa2jVyp7lucP-3AhdeIGFvDT-VzlJGtfwHy6HaVDhPzu5R8WHemyP9WezKaH_b"> In His first coming, Christ healed the degraded priesthood, but in His second coming, He will heal the remnant of the people of Israel. Then He will be everything to the earth and to us. This healing Christ will come suddenly. Thus, we need to be alert, ready to receive Him. </p>

This healing Christ is the Messenger of God, the Angel of the covenant, and the Desire of the nations. Christ’s being our healing is based upon His being the Sun of righteousness. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> word “Sun” indicates life, and the word “righteousness” indicates justice. The whole earth is filled with death and injustice, but with the healing Christ we have life and justice. We are waiting for Him to come as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings. </p>

Return to Me, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of hosts” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61156" data-verses="Malachi 3:7">v. 7</span>). Here Jehovah instructed the sons of Jacob to return to Him so that He would return to them that they might be blessed by Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61157" data-verses="Malachi 3:10">vv. 10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61158" data-verses="Malachi 3:12">12</span>).

Yet you have robbed Me. But you say, How have we robbed You? In tithes and offerings. With the curse you are cursed, yet you, even the whole nation, rob Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61160" data-verses="Malachi 3:8-9">3:8-9</span>). Here we see that after advising the sons of Jacob to return to Him, Jehovah charged them not to rob God in tithes and offerings that the curse would not be brought in to them. To rob God is to not give Him what He is due. He established the principle that of all the produce from the land, one tenth should go to Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61161" data-verses="Leviticus 27:30">Lev. 27:30</span>). The top tenth must go to Him. </p>

We may say that this matter of revival is the “kernel” within the “shell” of the books of the Minor Prophets. </p>

THE ASPIRATION OF GOD’S ELECT</h2><p data-content-id="q8Zs7nvNMsfVg_X_w8D_PPd2kttkXQX2r5hTFMKo8WFVXRhT4qSjxJtp6KZKna9sU"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61192" data-verses="Habakkuk 3:2">Habakkuk 3:2a</span> speaks of revival: “O Jehovah, revive Your work / In the midst of the years.” Among God’s elect there has always been an aspiration to be revived. As long as you are a saved one, every day, consciously or unconsciously, there is an aspiration with a spontaneous prayer within you: “O Lord, revive us.” Although we may not realize it, such an aspiration has been within us through all the years of our Christian life. </p>
<p data-content-id="y0lcYquWwdKETJpBzC6lae8548oFIlIy06wQmOHhaEVQwQC8mg_Cv47wo_bxpa7XH"> We may think that Habakkuk’s prayer for revival was good for him but has nothing to do with us. However, regarding his prayer, we need to realize that with God there is no time element. In the eyes of God, one person among His elect represents the whole. God always considers His elect as a corporate Body. This means that Habakkuk and we are one in the unit of God’s elect. Thus, when Habakkuk prayed for revival, we also prayed. We prayed for revival twenty-six hundred years ago. Such a prayer is an everlasting prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="8OwKrdCRY_get6yt9MyA6JKFGbfEY1sh5b-q8dS4DlGottMgcoKOL4o9sDwvS0_Js"> Many times in the last six years I charged the saints to put the God-ordained way into a living practice, but without a revival, how could we have anything living? If we endeavor to practice just the first step of the God-ordained way—to visit <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> people for the gospel—without being revived, this will be a heavy burden that no one can bear. We all need to realize that we have been saved and kept on earth to do one thing—to go to disciple the nations, beginning from “Jerusalem” and spreading to “Judea,” to “Samaria,” and to the uttermost part of the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61193" data-verses="Acts 1:8">Acts 1:8</span>). If we live for our education, a career, a good marriage, or a nice house, that is vanity of vanities. We are living here for the spreading of the Lord Jesus, not merely to our neighborhood but to the entire world. If we would do this, we need to be revived. This is why the Lord has led us to practice the morning revival. </p>
<p data-content-id="jaNd7pbgNL_DC8YJqZPTPBftpJgVIppJ6nxW0lvTJXYZcSRQsowrPrkT02ATlojNP"> This matter of morning revival is according to the natural law in God’s creation. God created the universe so that there is a sunrising every twenty-four hours. We believers should follow the sunrising to be revived every morning. Every day we need a “sunrising,” and this sunrising is a revival. If we experience a daily revival, then we will be living and qualified to practice the God-ordained way and to help the church to take this way. </p>

THE DESOLATION OF THE “TWO DAYS”<br/>AND THE RESURRECTION ON THE “THIRD DAY”</h2><p data-content-id="nqDKa2jVyp7lucP-3AhdeJmFsDz-VzlJGtfwHy6HaVDhPzu5R8WHemyP9WezKaH_b"> On the one hand, Habakkuk prayed for revival; on the other hand, Hosea spoke of the desolation of the “two days” and the resurrection on the “third day”: “He will enliven us after two days; / On the third day He will raise us up” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61194" data-verses="Hosea 6:2">6:2</span>). Since to God a thousand years are as one day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61195" data-verses="2Peter 3:8">2 Pet. 3:8</span>), these “two days” may refer to a period of two thousand years. For almost two thousand years, from the time Titus destroyed Jerusalem and the temple in A.D. 70, Israel, our representative, has been desolate. From that year Israel lost the priesthood, the sacrifices, the prophets, the king, and the temple. Eventually, there will be the “third day”—the thousand years of the millennial kingdom—when Israel will be raised up, that is, restored. </p>
<p data-content-id="6eXRMHatOOXDBuDEPngsu1exYbNQ9G3iKiH2Pl0R4r6GeJkofMnLlZ4xw7GLKVzNQ"> The principle is the same in our Christian life. At a certain time we became desolate. After the two days of desolation, there is the third day, which signifies the pneumatic Christ in resurrection. Today we may receive the pneumatic Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="21" id="21">[21]</span> in resurrection and thus enjoy the reality of His resurrection. If we have the resurrected Christ, we are in the morning, the sunrising, and this is a real revival to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="RLVKipJIY_MbxhNgw35H4w5Yr9ua9tI1TbWkzGej-CGr_PsdaHcg-3AmdYn5g8ezM"> In 1984 I realized that the recovery was in a dormant condition, like the desolation of the two days in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61196" data-verses="Hosea 6:2">Hosea 6:2</span>. However, if we experience a real revival, we will be in the third day. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="seNOUP1AJEKCxlOeTXtzCWHUYOPokuU1YOGtlaejp7fbTRZ7Cbt7fKxq_RkAxsoeB">III. THE OUTPOURING OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="w4Dn37AWp_vVaXU6kB2KkpWbIrG5YYRPZLSzaihGBA15yvFwGCvVCfkZvXvotMqQL"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61197" data-verses="Joel 2:28-29">Joel 2:28 and 29</span> speak of the outpouring of the Spirit. Every day we need the outpouring of the all-inclusive, consummated, compound, life-giving Spirit as the processed and consummated Triune God. This all-inclusive Spirit includes Christ’s divinity and humanity, the effectiveness of His death, and the power of His resurrection. This Spirit is our portion, our inheritance. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Lm58BObTWyNOJTd0UcSm_Af4mQlmCzJNLaNDGvvB9UUPXZ0qf3-_Nilq_-gHs3CKi">IV. THE RESPONSE OF GOD’S ELECT</h2><p data-content-id="muuPiZ7EJmr-l0IG9iTQapHyzORc1BUUWBy8GzrhBBg4TL6fPU6sG9xOMMRgPoJ7r"> “Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61198" data-verses="Haggai 1:14">Hag. 1:14a</span>). Here we see the response of God’s elect, who were stirred up by the Lord in the order of God’s authority. When they responded by being stirred up in their spirit by the Lord, we all were included. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZlmF5D6Gs2bg7Yn_n0a8KEOOXSonvcLR2zT4s658JVxWvT2Y-nfwoH-8v-PV0H_61"> In the Minor Prophets there are both the divine Spirit, the consummated Spirit of God, and the human spirit, the stirred-up spirit of God’s elect. The divine Spirit has been poured out, and our human spirit (the key to experiencing and enjoying Christ) responds to such a Spirit by being stirred up. </p>
<p data-content-id="AxFJ6arW_hZVPtCVtzpDzS1JwxIOvgUNTglFkEdgk2W2k8T22ygaTq6W5FtPU_crv"> We may feel that our spirit was stirred up early in our Christian life but that it is no longer stirred up. However, this is not true. Unconsciously, the spirit of every regenerated believer is stirred up. If we go to a place of worldly entertainment, our spirit will be stirred up to tell us to leave that place. Whenever we grieve the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61199" data-verses="Ephesians 4:30">Eph. 4:30</span>), we have no peace. This is the stirring up of our spirit. When we read the Bible, we feel calm and peaceful. Even in this calmness, our spirit is <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> under the stirring up by the Spirit. Every day we cannot avoid the stirring up of our spirit. The Bible reveals that once the consummated, compound, life-giving Spirit comes into us, He will never leave. As He dwells in us, He is often a “troublemaker,” stirring us up either negatively or positively. If we take care of this negative or positive stirring up, we will be revived, and we will be strengthened and encouraged to carry out the God-ordained way. </p>
