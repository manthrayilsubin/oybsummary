Here's a summary of the sermon in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**I. The Person of Jesus Christ:**<br><br>*   The sermon focuses on Jesus Christ, drawing from Psalm 110 and Hebrews.<br>*   Psalm 110:1-4 is heavily quoted in the New Testament, directly applied by Jesus to Himself.<br>*   Psalm 110:4 establishes Christ as a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.<br>*   Melchizedek, though mentioned in only a few verses (Psalm 110:4; Genesis 14:18-20), is a pivotal figure in understanding Christ's nature.<br>*   Hebrews 6:20 identifies Jesus as the forerunner who entered the Holiest of All.<br>*   Melchizedek was both king and priest, a union absent in the Levitical order.<br>*   Melchizedek's name means "King of Righteousness," and he was King of Salem (peace).<br>*   Melchizedek's meeting with Abraham highlights a choice between worldly gain and God's blessing.<br>*   Melchizedek offered bread and wine, foreshadowing the Lord's Supper.<br>*   Abraham's tithing to Melchizedek demonstrates an eternal ordinance predating the Mosaic Law.<br>*   Communion and tithing are viewed as eternal practices.<br><br>**II. Christ's Ascension to God's Right Hand:**<br><br>*   Psalm 2 depicts rebellion against God and His anointed, Jesus Christ.<br>*   God's response is to establish Christ as King on Mount Zion.<br>*   Psalm 2:7 ("Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee") refers to the resurrection.<br>*   Acts 13:33 confirms the begetting as occurring on the resurrection day.<br>*   Psalm 2 speaks of Christ's inheritance and rule over the earth.<br>*   Psalm 89:20-27 shows the dialogue between the Father and Son.<br>*   The Father anoints Christ, supports Him, and promises victory.<br>*   The Son declares the Father as his God and rock of salvation.<br>*   Hebrews 5:7 explains the Father's saving Christ from death through resurrection.<br>*   Psalm 89:27 declares Christ as the firstborn, exalted above earthly kings.<br>*   Revelation 1:5 reiterates Christ as the faithful witness, firstborn from the dead, and Prince of kings.<br>*   Christ's faithfulness in testimony led to His death and resurrection.<br><br>**III. Three Portraits of Christ:**<br><br>*   Hebrews 1:1-3 presents seven statements about Christ's divinity and humanity.<br>*   He is the heir of all things, the creator, the brightness of God's glory, the express image of His person, upholder of all things, purger of sins, and seated at God's right hand.<br>*   The sun is used as a parable of the Godhead: substance (Father), glory (Son), rays (Spirit).<br>*   Colossians 1:14-18 offers seven more statements: image of the invisible God, firstborn before creation, creator of all things, existing before all things, upholder of all things, head of the church, firstborn from the dead.<br>*   Zechariah 6:11-13 presents Christ as Joshua, the high priest, with crowns signifying kingship.<br>*   Seven statements about Christ as "the Man" in Zechariah 6 are presented.<br>*   He is the Branch (Messiah), grows from His place (humble beginnings), builds the temple (church), bears glory (weight of God's worth), sits and rules as King and Priest, and has perfect peace with the Father.<br>*   The "two" in Zechariah 6:13 are interpreted as Father and Son in perfect unity.<br><br>**IV. Christ's Reign and the Church's Role:**<br><br>*   Psalm 110 emphasizes Christ's current reign at God's right hand.<br>*   Christ's reign is "until" His enemies are subdued.<br>*   Christ is ruling now, amidst His enemies.  This current reign is emphasized.<br>*   The "rod of strength" in Psalm 110:2 represents authority, emanating from Zion (the church).<br>*   The rod is linked to Moses' authority in Egypt and Aaron's high priesthood.<br>*   The Holy Spirit empowers the church (Zion) to extend Christ's authority through prayer.<br>*   Psalm 110:3 speaks of "free will offerings," emphasizing total commitment to God.<br>*   The "womb of the morning" imagery represents a birth from darkness into holiness.<br>*   The church is portrayed as an army, mobilized to preach the gospel of the kingdom.<br>*   Matthew 24:14 states the sign of Christ's coming is the global preaching of the gospel of the kingdom.<br>*   Matthew 24:32-34 highlights the end-time generation witnessing the fulfillment of prophecy.<br>*   Psalm 22 and Psalm 102 point to a "set time" for God's mercy on Zion (church and Israel).<br>*   A seed (army) will declare God's righteousness to a people being born (Psalm 22).<br>*   Psalm 102 describes God's glory and the praise of a newly created people.  The sermon concludes with a strong emphasis on the imminent return of Christ and the church's role in proclaiming the gospel of the Kingdom.<br><br>
