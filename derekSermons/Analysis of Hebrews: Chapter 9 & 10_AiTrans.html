Here's a summary of the lecture in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**Hebrews 9 & 10 Lecture Summary:**<br><br>* **Covenant and Testament:**  The same Greek/Hebrew word translates to "covenant" and "testament," both requiring the death of the testator/covenant maker for validity.<br>* **Covenant, Sacrifice, Blood, Life:** A biblical pattern: covenant necessitates sacrifice, sacrifice requires bloodshed, bloodshed symbolizes a life laid down.<br>* **Abrahamic Covenants:** Genesis 15 (a covenant) foreshadows the Sinai covenant; Genesis 17 ("My" covenant) foreshadows the New Covenant through Christ.<br>* **Genesis 17 Significance:** Change of names (Abram to Abraham, Sarai to Sarah), promise of an heir (Isaac), circumcision (foreshadowing Christ's blood).<br>* **Hebrews 9:18:** The first covenant (Sinai) also required blood.  "Wherefore" indicates a causal relationship.<br>* **Hebrews 9:19:** Moses' use of blood, water, scarlet wool, and hyssop to sprinkle the scroll and people, signifying covenant ratification.<br>* **Hebrews 9:21:**  The tabernacle and its vessels were also sprinkled with blood for covenant inclusion.<br>* **Hebrews 9:22:**  Blood is necessary for cleansing and forgiveness, signifying a life laid down.<br>* **Ezekiel 18:20 & Romans 6:23:**  The consequence of sin is death ("the soul that sins shall die," "the wages of sin is death").<br>* **God's Justice:**  Requires both the protection of the innocent and the punishment of the guilty.<br>* **Christ's Substitution:** Jesus became the substitute, paying the penalty for sin through His death and shedding of His blood.<br>* **Biblical Logic:** The Bible's core principles are based on sound logic.  Faithful application of God's Word leads to consistent outcomes.<br>* **Hebrews 9:23-26:**  Comparison between earthly and heavenly sanctuaries and sacrifices.<br>* **Earthly Sanctuary:** Cleansed by animal sacrifices.<br>* **Heavenly Sanctuary:** Cleansed by Christ's sacrifice.<br>* **Christ's Entry:** Not into a man-made sanctuary, but into heaven itself.<br>* **Christ's Offering:**  A once-for-all sacrifice at the consummation of the ages.<br>* **Consummation of the Ages:**  From God's perspective, a relatively short time since Christ's sacrifice.  All themes of redemption culminate.<br>* **Sin's Removal:**  Christ's sacrifice completely removed sin from God's universe (except for the lake of fire).<br>* **Day of Atonement & Scapegoat:** Illustrates the complete removal of sin.<br>* **Hebrews 9:27-28:** Humanity's appointments: death, then judgment. Christ's appointments: offering Himself once, then appearing again for salvation.<br>* **Eager Awaiting:**  A necessary attitude for Christians awaiting Christ's return.<br>* **Hebrews 10 Overview:** Contains solemn warnings, practical applications, comparisons, and "let us" passages.<br>* **Hebrews 10:1-4:** Five weaknesses of the Levitical system: shadow not substance, endless sacrifices, inability to make perfect, yearly reminder of sin, insufficient to remove sin.<br>* **Hebrews 10:5-7 (Psalm 40):**  Jesus' fulfillment of God's will; emphasis on the body prepared for sacrifice.<br>* **Jesus' Motivation:**  To do God's will and finish His work (John 4:34).<br>* **Scripture Fulfillment:**  Jesus' life and death fulfilled prophecies.<br>* **Hebrews 10:8-10:**  Christ's sacrifice established the new covenant, sanctifying believers.<br>* **Hebrews 10:11-14:** Contrast between Levitical priests (always standing) and Christ (seated, His work complete).<br>* **Psalm 110:** Christ's current reign and future judgment.<br>* **Hebrews 10:14:** Christ's single sacrifice perfected those who are being sanctified (instantaneous and ongoing).<br>* **Hebrews 10:15-18 (Jeremiah 31:33-34):**  The Holy Spirit's testimony; God's forgetting of sins after forgiveness; no further sacrifice needed.<br>* **Hebrews 10:19-25:**  Practical application; "Let us" passage: draw near, hold fast, assemble, encourage.<br>* **Access to God:** Confidence in Jesus' blood, a new and living way through the veil (His flesh), a great high priest.<br>* **Hebrews 10:22:** Four requirements for true worship: sincere heart, full assurance of faith, hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, bodies washed with pure water.<br>* **Romans 8:1:**  No condemnation for those in Christ.<br>* **Baptism:**  Washing away sins, sanctifying the body, separating from Satan's kingdom.<br><br>
