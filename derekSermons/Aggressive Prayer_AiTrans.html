Here's a summary of the lecture in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**Spiritual Warfare Basics:**<br><br>* Christians are engaged in spiritual warfare.<br>* This warfare is against spiritual entities, not physical people.<br>* The battle is against rulerships, authorities, world powers, and spiritual hosts of wickedness.<br>* It's a kingdom conflict: God's kingdom versus Satan's kingdom.<br>* The battlefield is primarily in the mind.<br>* God provides spiritual weapons for victory.<br>* These weapons are not physical but mighty through God.<br>* They are used to pull down Satan's strongholds.<br><br>**Spiritual Armor (Ephesians 6:14-17):**<br><br>* Girdle of truth<br>* Breastplate of righteousness<br>* Shoes of the preparation of the gospel of peace<br>* Shield of faith<br>* Helmet of salvation (hope)<br>* Sword of the Spirit (the Word of God)<br><br>**Essential Spiritual Weapons & Deployment:**<br><br>* Christ's victory over Satan is foundational.<br>* We administer Christ's already-achieved victory.<br>* Three main weapons: Word of God, name of Jesus, blood of Jesus.<br>* All weapons are launched through the mouth.<br>* Four ways to deploy weapons: prayer, praise, testimony, preaching.<br>* Believers ultimately prevail, casting down Satan (Revelation 12:7-11).<br>* Victory comes through the blood of the Lamb and the word of testimony.<br>* Testimony makes the blood effective (like hyssop in the Old Covenant).<br>* Committed Christians are best equipped for spiritual warfare.<br><br>**Aggressive Prayer:**<br><br>* Two forms of aggressive prayer: binding and loosing, and specific, directed, persistent prayer.<br>* Binding and loosing (Matthew 16:19; Matthew 18:18-20):<br>    * Tremendous spiritual authority given to believers.<br>    * Requires agreement (sumphoneo â€“ harmony) among believers.<br>    * Requires the leading of the Holy Spirit.<br>    * Actions on earth have heavenly consequences.<br>    * Emphasizes either human responsibility or God's sovereignty.<br>* Examples of binding and loosing:<br>    * The Bible's canonization involved the church's decision-making.<br>    * A pastor in Denmark learned that God works through human initiative.<br>* Binding and loosing applies to various situations.<br>* The power is contingent on right relationships among believers.<br><br>**Dealing with the "Strong Man":**<br><br>* The "strong man" represents Satan's delegated authority in a situation.<br>* Examples: princes of Persia and Greece (Daniel 10).<br>* There are likely multiple levels of strong men.<br>* Identifying the strong man requires revelation.<br>* Binding the strong man precedes the taking of his goods.<br>* Examples of strong men: legalism, religious controversy, spiritual manipulation.<br><br>**Specific, Directed, Persistent Prayer:**<br><br>* Illustrated by Joshua's outstretched spear (Joshua 8:18-26):<br>    * Spiritual, not military, significance.<br>    * Represents persistent prayer until victory is complete.<br>    * God desires complete, not partial, victories.<br>* Illustrated by Elisha's instructions to Joash (2 Kings 13:14-25):<br>    * Spiritual empowerment through the laying on of hands.<br>    * The number of arrows represents the extent of victory.<br>    * Spiritual victory precedes physical victory.<br><br>**Personal Examples of Specific, Directed, Persistent Prayer:**<br><br>* Prayer for leaders in the North African campaign (World War II).<br>* Prayer for division between Russia and China.<br>* Prayer for raising up the righteous and putting down the wicked in the US government.<br>* The importance of God providing the specific prayer to pray.<br>* The need to persevere in prayer until the desired outcome is achieved.  <br>*  The role of the Holy Spirit in revealing effective prayers.<br><br>
