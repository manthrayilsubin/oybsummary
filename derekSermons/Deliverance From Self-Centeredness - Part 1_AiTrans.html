* **Previous Sessions Recap:** God's complete provision through the cross for all believer's needs (spiritual, emotional, etc.) and Satan's defeat. Satan's counterattack is to obscure the cross's work, leading to legalism and carnality.  Witchcraft is the tool used for this obscuration.<br><br>* **Galatians 3:1:** Highlights the deception of those who have forgotten the crucifixion of Christ.<br><br>* **Legalism and Carnality:** These are intertwined; legalism is the outward expression of inner carnality. Both result from an obscured understanding of the cross.<br><br>* **God's Protection:**  A fivefold deliverance, detailed in Galatians, is the only protection against witchcraft and Satan's manipulation.<br><br>* **Two Kingdoms:** There is only the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan; no neutral ground.  (Matthew 12:30)<br><br>* **Scattering vs. Gathering:**  We're either actively building God's kingdom or wasting our resources.<br><br>* **Galatians 1:4:**  The first deliverance: freedom from the present evil age.<br><br>* **Present Evil Age:** This age is evil because Satan is its god.  It's temporary; it will end.<br><br>* **God's Strategy:** God doesn't remove Satan immediately; instead, He delivers believers *from* this age.<br><br>* **Unfruitful Worries:** The present age causes worries that hinder believers' fruitfulness.<br><br>* **Non-Conformity:** Believers should not conform to the thinking and living of this age. (Romans 12:2)<br><br>* **Demas' Example:** Loving the present age is incompatible with loving God.<br><br>* **Results of Deliverance (from present evil age):**<br><br>    * Heavenly Citizenship.<br>    * No Continuing City Here. (Hebrews 13:14)<br>    * Eager Expectation of Christ's Return. (Hebrews 9:28)<br><br><br>* **Galatians 2:19:** Second deliverance: freedom from the law.<br><br>* **Death to the Law:**  Through the law's condemnation, we die to it and live for God through Christ's sacrifice.<br><br>* **Results of Deliverance (from the law):**<br><br>    * Freedom from Condemnation. (Romans 8:1)<br>    * Freedom to be Led by the Holy Spirit. (Romans 8:14)<br><br><br>* **Galatians 5:18:**  Being led by the Spirit means not being under the law.  It's an "either/or" situation.<br><br>* **Maturity and the Holy Spirit:** Spiritual maturity comes from being regularly led by the Holy Spirit.<br><br>* **Romans 8:3-4:** The law's righteous requirement (love) is fulfilled in us through Christ.<br><br>* **1 Timothy 1:5:** Love comes from a pure heart, good conscience, and sincere faith.<br><br>* **Galatians 2:20:** Third deliverance: freedom from self (the ego).<br><br>* **Crucifixion with Christ:**  Personal confession of being crucified with Christ.

(Proverbs 16:18)<br><br>* **A Safeguard:**  Getting on the floor, literally, before God is a safeguard against pride.<br><br>* **Lucifer and Jesus:**  Lucifer's upward striving led to a fall; Jesus' humility led to exaltation.<br><br>* **Scandinavian Pride:**  The speaker notes subtle pride within even seemingly humble cultures.<br><br>* **American Influence:** The speaker observes the impact of American culture and its perceived arrogance abroad.<br><br><br>* **South Africa:** The speaker expresses appreciation for South Africa while acknowledging the role of the church in apartheid.<br><br><br>* **Livingstone and Opposition:** Early missionaries faced opposition from colonists who opposed evangelizing Africans.<br><br>
