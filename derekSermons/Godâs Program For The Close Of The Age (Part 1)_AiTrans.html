Here's a 50-point bulleted summary of the provided text, focusing on key ideas and arguments:<br><br>**God's Purposes for the Close of the Age:**<br><br>*   God's primary purpose for the new race in Christ is to fulfill Adam's original purpose, which he failed due to sin.<br>*   God also aims to reverse the negative consequences of Adam's fall.<br>*   Five key reversals include: restored divine nature, restored authority over Satan, deliverance from evil spirits, restoration of creation, and identification with Christ's righteousness.<br>*   God's special purposes for the close of the age involve a sovereign intervention of grace.<br>*   This intervention is based on God's grace, not human merit, received through faith.<br>*   Acts 2:16-21 prophesies a final outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon all flesh.<br>*   This outpouring is unconditional and precedes Christ's return.<br>*   The Day of Pentecost was only a foretaste of this final outpouring.<br>*   This outpouring will reach every section of the human race.<br>*   God's people are accountable for the light available to them in their day.<br>*   The brightness of the "sun" (spiritual light) increases as the harvest (Christ's return) approaches.<br>*   Christians should not hide behind the achievements of past figures like Luther and Wesley.<br>*   Acts 3:19-21 outlines four stages leading to the age's close: repentance, refreshing, restoration, and Christ's return.<br>*   Repentance of God's people is crucial for God's intervention.<br>*   The barrier to God's work is always within the believers, not unbelievers.<br>*   The Welsh revival's slogan, "Bend the church and bow the world," highlights this.<br>*   Repentance parallels John the Baptist's role before Jesus' first coming.<br>*   God's foreknowledge of repentance doesn't negate the necessity of repentance.<br>*   The sins of God's people hinder God's work in the world.<br>*   Judgment begins at the house of God.<br>*   Seasons of refreshing follow repentance, a spiritual renewal.<br>*   The "times of restitution" (restoration) refer to a period of putting things back in their right place.<br>*   This restoration doesn't include Satan or the wicked dead.<br>*   Matthew 17:11 mentions Elijah's role in restoring all things before Christ's return.<br>*   Joel's prophecy outlines desolation, restoration, and judgment.<br>*   Desolation affects every area of God's people's inheritance.<br>*   The vine symbolizes the church, and the fig tree represents Israel.<br>*   The desolation of the vine and fig tree represents spiritual and national decline.<br>*   The invading insects (palmerworm, locust, cankerworm, caterpillar) represent demonic forces.<br>*   The author's experience with deliverance ministry highlights the pervasiveness of demonic influence in the church.<br>*   Satan's "fifth column" within the church hinders its effectiveness.<br>*   Many Christians need deliverance from evil spirits.<br>*   Restoration is achieved through the power of the Holy Spirit.<br>*   Spiritual forces are at play in both desolation and restoration.<br>*   Joel 2:18-20 describes God's restoration, providing corn, wine, and oil (word, Spirit, joy).<br>*   Restoration includes removing the "northern army" (demonic forces).<br>*   Restoration brings satisfaction, removing reproach and fear.<br>*   The "rain" symbolizes the Holy Spirit, given in former and latter rain.<br>*   God restores the years lost to demonic invasion.<br>*   Incomplete obedience is disobedience.<br>*   Contemporary Christianity faces choices mirroring Saul's path (usurpation, rejection of God's word, spiritism).<br>*   The kingdom of David emerges, representing true obedience to God's word.<br>*   The church's restoration to its spiritual inheritance parallels Israel's political restoration.<br>*   Luke 21:29-31 uses the fig tree and other trees to symbolize national restoration.<br>*   The emergence of new nations mirrors the "trees putting on their leaves."<br>*   Israel's independence is a key event in this process, followed by other nations.<br><br><br>This summary provides a comprehensive overview of the lecture's main points in a concise format.<br>
