Humility:**<br><br>*   1 Peter 5:5-6: God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.<br>*   Humility is a decision, a responsibility of the individual.<br>*   God doesn't make us humble; we must choose it.<br>*   Pride is a destructive problem; it precedes destruction.<br><br>**2. Receiving the Love of the Truth:**<br><br>*   2 Thessalonians 2:9-12: Satan's deception and God's response.<br>*   Protection from deception is receiving the *agape* love of the truth.<br>*   Strong delusion is sent by God to those who don't receive this love.<br>*   Example: The speaker's belief that God sent strong delusion to the Israeli government in 1994.<br>*   "Peace" and "love" are often misused for manipulation.  True peace requires righteousness.<br>*   God forgives but doesn't always remove consequences.<br><br>**3. Cultivating the Fear of the Lord:**<br><br>*   Numerous scriptures cited on the fear of the Lord.<br>*   The fear of the Lord brings longevity, good life, confidence, refuge, avoids death's snares, leads to life & satisfaction.<br>*   It's connected to wisdom, understanding, hating evil, and humility.<br>*   The Spirit of the Lord upon Jesus included the fear of the Lord.<br>*   The fear of the Lord balances joy; rejoicing with trembling.<br>*   Even redeemed Christians should fear God due to the price of redemption.<br>*   Flippancy is a denial of the fear of the Lord.<br><br>**4. Making and Keeping the Cross Central:**<br><br>*   1 Corinthians 2:1-5: Paul's approach in Corinth, focusing on Jesus Christ crucified.<br>*   Paul abandoned eloquent speech for a message centered on the cross.<br>*   God's strength is made perfect in weakness.<br>*   Opportunities to serve God are often inconvenient.<br>*   Focus on power is dangerous; it appeals to the natural man.<br>*   The cross is the only true foundation for power.<br>*   Charles Spurgeon analogy: preaching without the cross is like a drill sergeant instructing footless soldiers.<br>*   Galatians 6:14: Boasting only in the cross.<br><br>**Additional Points:**<br><br>*   The importance of the seven-fold Spirit in Isaiah 11.<br>*   The Charismatic movement's potential weakness in neglecting the fear of the Lord.<br>*   The speaker's personal experiences and observations.<br>*   The adversary, the devil, is active and powerful.<br>*   The need for caution and circumspection, not paralysis by fear.<br>*   The importance of the cross in overcoming pride and human wisdom.<br>*   The speakerâ€™s background in Greek Philosophy and understanding of Paul's use of "wisdom."<br>*   Paul's contrast between his ministry in Athens and Corinth.<br><br><br>This detailed summary provides a comprehensive overview of the sermon's key themes and supporting scriptures.<br>
