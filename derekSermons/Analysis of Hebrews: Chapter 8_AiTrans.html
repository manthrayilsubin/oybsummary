* **Session Overview:** A review of introductory material for a Bible study on the book of Hebrews (chapters 8 onward).  The previous sessions covered chapters 1-7.<br><br>**Teaching Methodology:**<br><br>* **Direct from Greek:** The instructor teaches directly from the Greek text with impromptu translation.<br>* **Comparative Study:** The instructor and Ruth read the Bible together, comparing the instructor's translation with two contemporary English versions (NASB and NIV). This method is described as slow but thorough.  Currently, they are studying Luke.<br>* **Bi-lingual Approach:** The instructor is fluent in Hebrew and Greek.<br><br>**Study Method:**<br><br>* **Analytical Approach:** The study method is primarily analytical, focusing on what the text says and what it means/applies to the audience.<br>* **Old Testament Connections:** Regular reference to related Old Testament passages is emphasized, as Hebrews is heavily influenced by the Old Testament.<br>* **Key Word Analysis:**  Identifying and tracking key words (13 listed) throughout the book helps reveal the main themes and the structure of the text.  English translations can obscure this due to variations in word choice. Concordances are suggested for those unfamiliar with the original languages.<br>* **Structural Features:** The significance of recurring numerical patterns (e.g., seven) is noted as a potential "signature of the Holy Spirit."  An example is given using 1 Corinthians 13 (love).<br>* **Student Requirements (Proverbs 2:1-5):**  Four requirements for effective Bible study are highlighted:<br>    * Receiving and treasuring God's sayings and commandments.<br>    * Attentiveness and a humble heart (willingness to be taught).<br>    * Earnest, importunate prayer.<br>    * Diligent searching and study (like seeking hidden treasure).<br>* **Reward:**  Discerning the fear of the Lord and discovering the knowledge of God.  The fear of the Lord is presented as key to true knowledge of God.<br><br>**Book of Hebrews Overview:**<br><br>* **Date:** Before 70 AD (destruction of the Second Temple).<br>* **Audience:** Jewish Christians.  The exact location and identity remain unclear.<br>* **Central Theme:** Jesus as high priest. The instructor stresses that this focus is crucial for understanding the book.<br>* **Recurring Themes:** Inheritance, rest, and perfection (maturity, completion). The book is forward-looking (towards inheritance and upward toward God). True rest is found only in the inheritance.<br>* **Warnings:** Five solemn warnings against spiritual complacency and backsliding (neglect, unbelief, apostasy, willful sin, and failing to respond to God's grace).  These warnings are directed at religious people, not just those openly sinful.<br>* **Purpose (Hebrews 6:18):** To provide strong encouragement.  The Holy Spirit is identified as the encourager of God’s people; any discouraging influence is not of the Holy Spirit.<br>* **Key Words (13 total, grouped in fours):**<br>    * **Group 1:** High Priest<br>    * **Group 2:** Promise, Oath, Covenant<br>    * **Group 3:** Offering, Sacrifice, Blood<br>    * **Group 4:** Faith, Hope, Confession<br>    * **Objectives:** Inheritance, Rest, Perfection.<br><br>**Structural Elements of Hebrews:**<br><br>* **Five Solemn Warnings:**  Neglect, unbelief, apostasy, willful sin, continuing in sin, and coming short of God's grace.<br>* **Seven Passages Indicating Positive Practical Applications:** (Specific passages not listed in the summary)<br>* **Seven Passages of Comparison and Contrast:**<br>    * Jesus' superiority over angels.<br>    * Jesus' superiority over Moses.<br>    * Melchizedek's priesthood over the Levitical priesthood.<br>    * The New Covenant over the Old Covenant.<br>    * The heavenly tabernacle over Moses' tabernacle.<br>    * Jesus' sacrifice over Levitical sacrifices.<br>    * Mount Zion over Mount Sinai.<br>* **Twelve "Let Us" Passages:** (Specific passages not listed in the summary) Each indicates a collective decision by God's people.<br>* **Seven Key Passages Focusing on Jesus:**<br>    * Hebrews 1:2<br>    * Hebrews 2:9<br>    * Hebrews 2:17<br>    * Hebrews 3:1<br>    * Hebrews 4:14<br>    * Hebrews 6:19-20<br>    * Hebrews 7:22, 28<br><br>**Levitical vs. Melchizedek Priesthood (14 points of contrast):**<br><br>* Melchizedek combines priesthood and kingship; Levitical priesthood is separate from kingship.<br>* Melchizedek offered bread and wine (New Covenant); Levitical priests returned portions of sacrifices.<br>* Melchizedek received tithes from Abraham; Levitical priests gave tithes through Abraham.<br>* Melchizedek had a permanent priesthood; Levitical priesthood was temporary due to mortality.<br>* Melchizedek's genealogy is not traced; Levitical priests must be descended from Abraham.<br>* Melchizedek blessed Abraham; Levitical priests received blessings from Abraham.<br>* Melchizedek provided direct access to God and perfection; Levitical priesthood could not.<br>* Melchizedek's priesthood was based on indestructible life; Levitical priesthood based on physical requirements.<br>* Melchizedek was appointed with God's oath; Levitical priests were not.<br>* Melchizedek insured a superior covenant; Levitical priests were linked to an inferior one.<br>* Melchizedek provided one sufficient priest; Levitical priests were many and insufficient.<br>* Melchizedek's priesthood provided complete and eternal salvation; Levitical priesthood could not.<br>* Jesus (Melchizedekian priest) didn't need sacrifice for His sins; Levitical priests did.<br>* Melchizedek's priesthood provided God's perfect Son; Levitical priesthood provided frail men.<br><br><br>**Hebrews Chapter 8 Discussion:**<br><br>* **Verses 1-2:** Jesus' high priesthood is highlighted—seated at God's right hand, minister of the heavenly sanctuary and true tabernacle (not man-made).  Four key points are emphasized: He sat down (sacrifice complete), He sat on a throne (kingship), He ministers in the heavenlies, and His ministry is in the true tabernacle pitched by God.<br>* **Verses 3-5:** The essential function of a priest is sacrifice; only priests can offer gifts and sacrifices to God.  Jesus' sacrifice is unique and all-sufficient. Earthly priesthood is a model/shadow of the heavenly reality.<br>* **Exodus 25:9, 40:** The earthly tabernacle was a copy of a heavenly original. The instructor emphasizes the reality of spiritual things in heaven, contrasting it with a potentially limited understanding of the spiritual as vague or indistinct.  The instructor shares personal anecdotes and scriptural references to illustrate the tangible aspects of heaven.<br>* **Revelation 11:19; 15:5-8:** These passages are used to support the existence of a heavenly temple and the ark of the covenant, suggesting an eternal covenant between God the Father and Jesus Christ predating creation.<br>* **Verses 6-8:** Introduces the comparison between the Old and New Covenants, highlighting the superiority of the New Covenant in three aspects:  Jesus' superior ministry, a better covenant, and better promises. The inadequacy of the Old Covenant was in the people, not the Law itself. The Law is good, but people fail to live by it.<br><br>The session ends with a promise to continue the discussion of the Old and New Covenants in the next session.<br>
