* God's pattern for church order emphasizes humility (lowliness, meekness, longsuffering, forbearance).<br>* The way up is the way down, mirroring Jesus' example.<br>* Seven basic unities found the Church: one body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God.<br>* Five ministries are given after Christ's ascension: apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, teachers.<br>* Apostles were appointed after Christ's ascension, not primarily during his earthly ministry.<br>* Approximately 28 apostles are named in the New Testament.<br>* Two main functions of ministries: equipping believers and building up the body of Christ.<br>* Three goals: unity, maturity, completeness.<br>* The alternative to God's way is retardation, instability, and deception.<br>* The climax is completeness, unity, and strength.<br>* Isaiah 52:8 describes a time of restoration, with harmony and single vision among leaders.<br>* The Church has two main aspects: universal (Catholic) and local.<br>* The universal Church comprises all true believers across ages, races, denominations, and backgrounds.<br>* "Church" (ekklesia) means an assembly called out from a larger group.<br>* In Acts 19, ekklesia is used secularly to refer to the assembly of Ephesus.<br>* The Church is the people, not the building.<br>* Admission to the Church requires fulfilling specific requirements.<br>* Matthew 16:16-18 discusses Peter's confession and the rock on which the Church is built.<br>* The rock is Christ, not Peter (petra vs. petros).<br>* Four elements for admission: confrontation with Christ, revelation by the Spirit, acknowledgment, public confession.<br>* Entrance into God's kingdom requires public confession.<br>* John 10 presents the parable of the sheepfold, illustrating entry into the Church.<br>* The sheepfold represents the company of believers on earth.<br>* Entering by the door (Jesus Christ) is crucial; those who enter otherwise are thieves and robbers.<br>* Jesus is both the door (crucified) and the shepherd (risen).<br>* Entrance into the true Church requires a relationship with Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<br>* Cults that deny the shed blood of Jesus are considered thieves and robbers by this teaching.<br>* The Church is the central vehicle of divine revelation.<br>* Four of the five ministries are primarily for the universal Church: apostles, prophets, evangelists, and teachers.<br>* The shepherd/pastoral ministry is primarily for the local church.<br>* An apostle is literally one sent forth.<br>* Jesus is the first and greatest apostle.<br>* He was sent by the Father and returned as High Priest.<br>* Jesus' High Priestly ministry is valid based on our confession.<br>* Jesus sent the twelve disciples, transforming them into apostles upon sending.<br>* Judas's unfaithfulness and Matthias's appointment are discussed.<br>* There were 14 apostles before Pentecost.<br>* After the ascension, Christ gave gifts, with apostles first.<br>* Barnabas and Paul became apostles after being sent forth from Antioch.<br>* The Holy Spirit sent them, but through human agency.<br>* The King James Version sometimes translates apostle as "messenger."<br>* Apostles were sent from local churches after Pentecost.<br>* Apostles returned to their sending churches to report.<br>* Apostles were accountable to the churches that sent them.<br>* It is unscriptural for individuals to declare themselves apostles without authorization and accountability.<br>* An apostle's task is as a master builder or architect, establishing and maintaining church order.<br>* A completed local church is the seal of an apostolic ministry.<br>* Signs of an apostolic ministry include endurance and miracles.<br>* The apostle is a master builder, understanding the church's structure from foundation to roof.<br>* The church at Corinth was the seal of Paul's apostleship.<br>* Signs of an apostle include patience, signs, wonders, and mighty deeds.<br>* Apostles worked in teams, never individually (except possibly evangelists).<br>* Apostles, prophets, and shepherds are always plural in Scripture.<br>* Evangelists and teachers may operate singly.<br>* Philip, an evangelist, went to Samaria alone, but apostles followed to complete the church building.<br>* Apostolic teams such as Barnabas and Paul, Paul and Silas and Timothy, etc. are mentioned.<br>* Paul, Silas and Timothy jointly wrote 1 Thessalonians.<br>* Peter, James, and John were apostles to the Jews; Paul, Barnabas, and Titus to the Gentiles.<br>* There were chief apostles and less chief, but all were genuine.<br>* False apostles existed.<br>* The church at Ephesus tested and rejected false apostles.<br><br>
