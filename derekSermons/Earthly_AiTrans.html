Here's a summary of the provided text in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**Human Personality & The Fall:**<br><br>*   The text uses 1 Thessalonians 5:23-24 as a foundation for understanding the triune nature of human personality: spirit, soul, and body.<br>*   Genesis 1:26 establishes man's creation in God's image (outward appearance) and likeness (inner structure).<br>*   Man's spirit originates from God's breath (Genesis 2:7).<br>*   Man's body is formed from clay, infused with divine life.<br>*   The soul, the unique individual ego, emerges from the union of spirit and body, encompassing will, emotions, and intellect ("I want, I think, I feel").<br>*   Sin causes spiritual death (Genesis 2:17), rebellion in the soul, and corruptibility of the body.<br>*   The "first death" is spiritual; the "second death" is eternal separation from God.<br><br>**Salvation & its Effects:**<br><br>*   Salvation makes the spirit alive again (Ephesians 2:4-6).<br>*   Repentance reconciles the soul to God.  Unrepentant rebellion is a significant problem.<br>*   The body becomes a temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).<br>*   Salvation makes the body eligible for the first resurrection (Philippians 3:10-11).<br><br>**Functions of Spirit, Soul, & Body:**<br><br>*   The spirit enables direct communion with God and true worship (1 Corinthians 6:17; John 4:23-24).<br>*   The soul is the decision-making element, acting as the intermediary between spirit and body.<br>*   The word of God is the only reliable means of discerning between spirit and soul (Hebrews 4:12).<br>*   Discernment requires practice and maturity in faith (Hebrews 5:13-14).<br><br>**Spiritual vs. Soulish:**<br><br>*   The Greek word *pneuma* (spirit) yields the adjective *pneumatikos* (spiritual).<br>*   The Greek word *psuche* (soul) yields the adjective *psuchikos* (soulish), a term lacking a direct equivalent in English.<br>*   The text argues for the creation of the word "soulish" to accurately translate *psuchikos*.<br>*   Soulishness is contrasted with spirituality throughout 1 Corinthians 15 (physical body).<br>*   The soulish man cannot understand spiritual things (1 Corinthians 2:14-15).<br>*   Jude 19 highlights the presence of both spiritual and soulish individuals within the church.<br>*   James 3:15 presents a hierarchy of wisdom: earthly, soulish, demonic.<br><br>**Earthly, Soulish, Demonic:**<br><br>*   "Earthly" Christians limit their vision to earthly things.<br>*   Examples of non-earthly individuals are Abraham and Moses (Hebrews 11).<br>*   Paul warns against hope limited to this life (1 Corinthians 15:19).<br>*   Soulishness is egocentric, focusing on self-interest.<br>*   Soulishness opens the door to demonic influence.<br><br>**Old Testament Examples of Decline:**<br><br>*   Aaron's creation of the golden calf illustrates a shift from God-focus to human-focus, leading to idolatry (Exodus 32).<br>*   Nadab and Abihu's offering of profane fire demonstrates the danger of worshiping in a spirit other than the Holy Spirit (Leviticus 9:23-10:2).<br>*   The rebellion of Korah and his followers highlights the consequences of challenging God's authority (Numbers 16).<br><br>**New Testament Application & Warning:**<br><br>*   Hebrews 12:28-29 emphasizes the need for reverence and godly fear in approaching God.<br>*   The text critiques a lack of awe and reverence in contemporary Charismatic worship.<br>*   The text argues that much contemporary Charismatic worship is soulish and self-centered.<br><br>**Five Examples of Charismatic Movement Problems:**<br><br>*   The Latter Rain movement: Initially powerful, later marred by pride and immorality.<br>*   The Manifested Sons: Powerful in demon casting but ultimately sought revelation from demons.<br>*   The Children of God/The Family: A powerful ministry that fell into manipulation and control.<br>*   William Branham: A remarkable ministry later affected by pride and the misuse of gifts.<br>*   The Discipleship/Shepherding Movement: Began with supernatural intervention but succumbed to personal ambition and un-renewed thinking.<br><br>**Common Elements of Failure:**<br><br>*   Pride: The most dangerous sin, leading to destruction.<br>*   Mixture of spirits: A blend of truth and error, resulting from soulishness.<br><br>**Conclusion:**<br><br>*   The text emphasizes the importance of the cross in crucifying the ego and avoiding soulishness.<br>*   The text warns of the perilous times described in 2 Timothy 3, characterized by self-love and a denial of the power of godliness.<br>*   The text stresses the importance of the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.<br>
