Here's a summary of the sermon in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**The Local Church:**<br><br>* The sermon focuses on the five ministries in Ephesians 4:11: apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers.<br>* Four are "mobile" (Universal Church): apostles, prophets, evangelists, teachers.<br>* One is "resident" (Local Church): shepherds.<br>* The speaker initially misunderstood the Local Church, comparing his error to mistaking artichoke for cabbage.<br>* The Local Church is defined simply: that part of the Universal Church resident in a given locality.<br>* Membership requires a relationship with Christ and residence in the locality.<br>* Membership in the Universal Church solely requires a relationship with Christ.<br><br>**Development of the Local Church:**<br><br>* The Local Church develops like a human body from a cell.<br>* Four phases of development are outlined:<br>    * **Cell:** Two or three believers gathered in Jesus' name (Matthew 18:15-20).<br>    * **Appointment of Elders:** Disciples become a church (Acts 14:22-23).<br>    * **Completed Leadership:** Bishops/elders, deacons, and saints (Philippians 1:1).<br>    * **Completed Ministries:** Eight ministries listed in 1 Corinthians 12:28.<br><br>* The Holy Spirit leads believers together into Jesus' name, not based on denomination or doctrine.<br>* Matthew 18:20 ("where two or three are gathered...") refers to the Local Church, not the Universal Church.<br>* Only one Local Church exists in any given locality, regardless of size.  Denominations are seen as unauthorized divisions.<br><br><br>**Leadership in the Local Church:**<br><br>* There are two levels of leadership: spiritual and material.<br>* **Spiritual Leadership:** Elders, overseers, shepherds, bishops, pastors (all the same).  Always plural, never singular.<br>*  The speaker emphasizes the plurality of leadership: elders are never singular.<br>* Qualifications for elders are found in 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1.<br>* Qualifications for deacons are in Acts 6 and 1 Timothy 3.<br>* The speaker highlights the importance of the congregation choosing deacons, ensuring accountability.<br><br>**The Shepherd Ministry:**<br><br>* The shepherd ministry is crucial and demanding.<br>* Three key passages about shepherding: John 10, Psalm 23, Ezekiel 34.<br>* Ezekiel 34 shows what God expects from shepherds: strengthen the weak, heal the sick, etc.<br>* The shepherd ministry requires:<br>    * A life laid down for the sheep.<br>    * Personal knowledge and connection with the sheep.<br>    * Speaking and leading the sheep.<br>    * Providing pasture and protection.<br>* Sheep without shepherds are scattered and vulnerable.<br>* Every believer should either be a shepherd or have one.<br>* There's a significant need for more shepherds in the church.  The current state is criticized as ineffective.<br>* The speaker calls for men to take on the shepherd ministry.<br>* The sermon ends with a prayer for the raising up of shepherds.<br><br>* The speaker uses the example of the Pentecostal movement in Sweden as a case study, both for what it did well (emphasis on local congregations) and what it did poorly (overly strict membership requirements).<br><br>* The sermon emphasizes that an elder is a relative term, dependent on the maturity of the congregation.<br><br>* The speaker discusses the three aspects of one spiritual leader (overseer - task; elder - qualification; shepherd - ministry).<br><br>* The speaker critiques the modern church for being too fragmented and focused on competition rather than unity.<br>
