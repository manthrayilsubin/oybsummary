Here's a summary of the lecture in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**I. The Current State of the Church and a New Phase of Truth:**<br><br>*   The Holy Spirit is leading the church towards a new understanding of apostolic teams.<br>*   This theme is emerging spontaneously across various Christian denominations and cultures.<br>*   The previous phase focused on the rediscovery of the importance of elders in church leadership.<br>*   The speaker believes apostolic teams represent the next major phase of truth.<br>*   The speaker uses generalizations rather than detailed scriptural proof-texting to convey the main ideas.<br><br>**II. Two Main Forms of Church Leadership:**<br><br>*   On a purely human level, the New Testament depicts two main leadership structures.<br>*   These are Apostolic Teams and Presbyteries (groups of elders).<br>*   Apostolic teams are considered to come first historically and logically, with presbyteries developing from them.<br>*   Both are typically plural, emphasizing corporate rather than singular leadership.<br><br>**III. The Rejection of Singular Earthly Headship:**<br><br>*   The speaker rejects the concept of a single earthly head of the church.<br>*   Jesus is the sole head of the church, residing in heaven.<br>*   The Holy Spirit is God's resident representative on earth, building the body of Christ.<br>*   The concept of plural leadership is challenging for many contemporary Christians accustomed to single pastoral leadership.<br><br>**IV. The Meaning and Application of "Shepherd," "Elder," and "Overseer":**<br><br>*   The speaker clarifies the terms "pastor" and "shepherd," noting their differing connotations in modern English.<br>*   In the New Testament, "shepherd" (singular) is applied only to Jesus.<br>*   The terms "elder," "overseer" (bishop), and "shepherd" refer to the same individuals in the New Testament.<br>*   Acts 20 and 1 Peter 5 demonstrate the plural nature of these roles.<br>*   Qualification is eldership, the job is overseership, the ministry is shepherding.<br><br>**V. Unity Among Shepherds, Not Just Sheep:**<br><br>*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of unity among shepherds (pastors) for the unity of the flock.<br>*   Pastors in a city should recognize each other as co-shepherds of one flock.<br>*   Efforts to unite the sheep without uniting the shepherds will ultimately fail.<br>*   A story is recounted of a conference attempting to unite charismatic preachers.  While it didn't fully unify theologies, it fostered relationships.<br><br>**VI. The Primary Role of Elders:**<br><br>*   The primary function of elders is governance, ruling, and order.<br>*   Ungoverened churches are disorderly and vulnerable.<br>*   The Old Testament depicts elders as sitting in the city gates, positions of authority and judgment.<br>*   New Testament elders similarly hold responsibility for governing God's people in their area.<br>*   This governing role cannot be carried out effectively by a single individual.<br>*   A united eldership can protect the church from false teachings.<br><br>**VII. The Role of Apostolic Teams:**<br><br>*   The function of apostolic teams is extension and outreach, reaching the unreached (Romans 15:20-21).<br>*   Unlike Presbyteries, Apostolic Teams are mobile and typically work corporately, not individually.<br>*   The speaker rejects the notion of apostolic franchises, advocating for collaboration rather than domination.<br><br>**VIII. Sovereignty vs. Independence in the Church:**<br><br>*   The speaker advocates for the sovereignty of local churches, accountable to God, not to outside authorities.<br>*   This does not equate to independence; churches are interconnected and interdependent.<br>*   The term "independent" is considered inappropriate for Christians, who are members of a body.<br>*   Interdependence exists between presbyteries and apostolic teams.<br><br>**IX. The Interdependence of Presbyteries and Apostolic Teams:**<br><br>*   Apostles appoint elders (Acts 14:23), and elders send out apostles (Acts 13:1-3).<br>*   This reciprocal relationship creates a reproductive cycle of leadership.<br>*   Experienced leaders, not just inexperienced ones, should be sent out on apostolic missions.<br>*   The sending of leaders creates opportunities for new leadership to emerge.<br><br>**X. The First Apostolic Team and Its Significance:**<br><br>*   Jesus is presented as the first apostle (Hebrews 3:1).<br>*   His ministry, including the twelve and women, demonstrates the ideal model of a diverse apostolic team (Luke 8).<br>*   Apostolic teams should visibly demonstrate the character of God's kingdom.<br>*   The early church was mobile, not stationary.<br><br>**XI. Apostolic Attestation and Supernatural Power:**<br><br>*   Apostolic ministry should be marked by supernatural attestation (Romans 15:18-19, 2 Corinthians 12:12).<br>*   Perseverance and signs/wonders are key characteristics of apostolic ministry.<br>*   The speaker emphasizes that the gospel requires supernatural demonstration for genuine obedience.<br>*   The speaker rejects the idea of apostolic succession in favor of the present apostolic ministry.<br><br>**XII. Conclusion:**<br><br>*   The focus should be on apostolic ministry, not apostolic succession.<br>*   The kingdom of God is about power, not just words (1 Corinthians 4:20).<br><br>
