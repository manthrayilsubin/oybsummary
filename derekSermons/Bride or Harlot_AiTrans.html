Here's a summary of the sermon in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**I. Introduction & Theme:**<br><br>*   The study focuses on Revelation's depiction of the church as either a Bride or a Harlot.<br>*   It's a prophetic study, but the speaker believes its fulfillment is imminent.<br>*   Evidence of this duality is already visible within Christendom.<br>*   The next study will address the False Church and False Christ.<br>*   The study serves as a postscript to a series on the New Testament church.<br><br>**II. Revelation's Contrasting Images:**<br><br>*   Revelation 17 describes the "great whore" (harlot, prostitute, adulteress) sitting on many waters.<br>*   Kings of the earth commit fornication with her.<br>*   Inhabitants of the earth are drunk with her wine of fornication.<br>*   She's arrayed in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold and precious stones.<br>*   She holds a golden cup full of abominations.<br>*   Her forehead bears the name "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT."<br>*   Revelation 19 depicts the Bride of Christ, arrayed in fine linen, clean and white.<br>*   The fine linen symbolizes the righteousness of saints.<br>*   Revelation 21 reiterates the image of the Bride, the Lamb's wife.<br>*   Both the harlot and the bride represent groups, not individuals.<br>*   The speaker believes only two significant groups will exist at the end of the age: the bride and the harlot.<br>*   This is a crucial personal decision for every believer.<br><br>**III. Genesis' Parallel: Cain and Abel's Offerings:**<br><br>*   Genesis 4 introduces the first depiction of religion in the Bible.<br>*   Cain's and Abel's offerings represent two contrasting types of religion.<br>*   Every person's religion falls into one of these two categories.<br>*   Cain's offering was of the fruit of the ground.<br>*   Abel's offering was of the firstlings of his flock and their fat.<br>*   God accepted Abel's offering but rejected Cain's.<br>*   Cain's anger led to the murder of Abel.<br>*   The story's details are highly significant.<br>*   Abel's religion is characterized by grace received by faith.<br>*   Cain's religion is characterized by works without grace.<br><br>**IV. Six Points of Contrast: Abel vs. Cain:**<br><br>*   **Revelation:** Abel received divine revelation; Cain rejected it.<br>*   **Substitution:** Abel acknowledged the need for substitutionary sacrifice; Cain denied it.<br>*   **Propitiation:** Abel offered propitiation for the curse on the earth; Cain offered cursed produce.<br>*   **Attestation:** God supernaturally attested to Abel's offering; He did not to Cain's.<br>*   **Outcome:** Abel's religion produced a martyr; Cain's produced a murderer.<br>*   **Future:** Abel's religion will bring forth the bride; Cain's will bring forth the harlot.<br><br>**V. The Espousal and Marriage Metaphor:**<br><br>*   The church is espoused to Christ, not yet married.<br>*   This is a period of probation.<br>*   2 Corinthians 11 warns against corruption of believers' minds.<br>*   The dangers include another Jesus, another spirit, and another gospel.<br>*   A "social gospel" is presented as an example of Cain's religion.<br>*   False apostles and deceitful workers are agents of Satan.<br>*   This is happening in churches worldwide.<br>*   1 Timothy 4 speaks of departing from the faith due to seducing spirits and demonic doctrines.<br>*   Matthew 24 foretells false prophets who will deceive many.<br>*   The love of many will grow cold.<br>*   Endurance is essential.<br><br>**VI. Contrasting Spirits & Attitudes:**<br><br>*   True believers long for Christ's return (John 14, 1 Thessalonians 4).<br>*   The Holy Spirit prepares the bride (Revelation 22).<br>*   The spirit of antichrist prepares those for a false Christ.<br>*   1 John 2 and 4 warn against believing every spirit.<br>*   Many antichrists exist, culminating in one ultimate antichrist.<br>*   The spirit of antichrist operates where the true Christ has been preached.<br>*   It's a denial of Jesus as the Messiah.<br><br>**VII. Marks of the Spirit of Antichrist:**<br><br>*   Association with true believers.<br>*   Denial that Jesus is the Messiah.<br>*   Denial of the Father and the Son.<br>*   Denial that Jesus came in the flesh.<br>*   Denial of the virgin birth.<br><br>**VIII. The True Church: Bride of Christ:**<br><br>*   Ephesians 5 describes the church's submission to Christ.<br>*   Christ's love for the church is sacrificial.<br>*   The church is to be sanctified and cleansed by the Word.<br>*   Purity of spirit requires the washing of water by the word.<br>*   The bride makes herself ready (Revelation 19).<br>*   1 Corinthians 1 emphasizes the need for spiritual gifts.<br>*   Isaiah 61 depicts the bride adorned with garments of salvation and righteousness.<br>*   The grace gifts are seen as adornments from the bridegroom.<br>*   The bride is characterized by expectancy (Hebrews 9, Titus 2).<br><br><br>This provides a detailed outline covering the main points of the sermon.
