Here's a summary of the lengthy sermon in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**Biblical Grounds for Divorce and Remarriage:**<br><br>*   The speaker focuses solely on scriptural interpretation.<br>*   Ezra commanded Jewish men to divorce non-Jewish wives, establishing that the Bible does endorse divorce in some contexts.<br>*   The speaker criticizes church laws on divorce as burdensome and hypocritical.<br>*   Pre-Mosaic law: Adultery's penalty was death, rendering divorce a non-issue after the adulterer's death.  The story of Judah and Tamar illustrates this.<br>*   Mosaic Law: Adultery's penalty was death for both parties, again making divorce relevant only after death.<br>*   Jesus permits divorce only on the grounds of *porneia* (sexual immorality).  This is not limited to premarital sex.<br>*   *Porneia* encompasses adultery, incest, homosexuality, and bestiality.<br>*   Matthew 5:32 and 19:9 reiterate that divorce is permitted only for *porneia*; remarriage after divorce for other reasons is adultery.<br>*   Acts 15:20 and 15:29 list "sexual immorality" among forbidden acts for Gentiles, showing it applies to both married and unmarried individuals.<br>*   1 Corinthians 5:1 uses *porneia* to describe both adultery and incest.<br>*   1 Corinthians 5:9-11 lists fornicators (*porneia*) among those who will not inherit the kingdom of God.<br>*   Jude 7 links *porneia* to the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah (homosexuality).<br>*   The speaker advises divorce in cases of discovered homosexuality.<br>*   Forgiveness is necessary for truly repentant spouses, but continued marriage is not mandatory.<br>*   The speaker contends that divorce includes the right to remarry;  "separatio a mensa et thoro" is a human invention.<br>*   Deuteronomy 24 demonstrates that under Mosaic law, divorce implied the right to remarry.<br>*   1 Corinthians 7:27-28 implies that remarriage after scriptural divorce isn't sinful.<br>*   Paul's teaching in 1 Corinthians 7 suggests a second ground for divorce: desertion by an unbelieving spouse after the believing spouse comes to faith.<br><br>**Marriage Vow and Application:**<br><br>*   The marriage vow contains a "use clause" (fidelity) and a "time clause" (until death).<br>*   Breaking the "use clause" (infidelity) voids the "time clause," allowing for divorce.<br>*   The speaker argues against the traditional church view that divorce always renders both parties guilty.<br><br>**Dealing with Difficult Cases and Forgiveness:**<br><br>*   Many situations exist not explicitly addressed in the New Testament.  The speaker emphasizes the need for mature Christian leadership to provide guidance.<br>*   The speaker's personal experience includes marrying a divorcee after carefully examining the scriptural justification for her divorce.<br>*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of the complete forgiveness found in Jesus' sacrifice.<br>*   Matthew 12:31 states that all sins, except blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, are forgivable.<br>*   Acts 13:38 states that belief in Jesus offers justification from all things, including adultery.<br>*   1 Corinthians 6:9-11 highlights the cleansing and justification available through faith in Jesus.<br>*   The speaker cautions against continued guilt after repentance and faith in Jesus' atonement.<br>*   James 2:12-13 emphasizes the importance of showing mercy to avoid judgment without mercy.<br><br>**Healing from Rejection:**<br><br>*   The speaker focuses on the common wound of rejection, often stemming from divorce or childhood experiences.<br>*   Healing involves:<br>    *   Acknowledging the hurt.<br>    *   Trusting in Jesus' atonement and acceptance.<br>    *   Laying down bitterness and resentment.<br>*   Forgiveness is presented as a decision, not an emotion.<br>*   The speaker uses the analogy of tearing up IOUs to illustrate forgiveness.<br>*   Isaiah 54:6 describes God's restorative action toward a rejected wife.<br>*   The speaker explains Jesus' ultimate rejection by God and emphasizes God's acceptance received through Jesus.<br>*   Matthew 6:14-15 links forgiveness of others to receiving God's forgiveness.<br>*   A prayer for healing from rejection is offered.<br><br>This detailed breakdown captures the essence of the lengthy sermon on divorce and remarriage, focusing on the speaker's scriptural arguments and approach to healing.<br>
