Marks of the Glorious Church (Ephesians 5:25-27):**<br><br>*   Jesus loved the church and gave Himself for it.<br>*   He sanctifies and cleanses the church.<br>*   This cleansing is through the "washing of water by the word."<br>*   Redemption through blood and sanctification through the Word are both essential.<br>*   The Word's sanctifying power is crucial for readiness to meet the Lord.<br>*   The church will be glorious, holy, and without blemish.<br><br>**III. Preparing the Church (Ephesians 4:11-13):**<br><br>*   Five key ministries build the church: apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers.<br>*   These equip saints for ministry.<br>*   The goal is unity of faith and acknowledgment of Jesus.<br>*   Doctrinal disputes do not unite; acknowledgment of Christ does.<br>*   Acknowledging Christ leads to unity in salvation, healing, deliverance, and the Spirit.<br>*   The church will mature into the "fullness of Christ."<br>*   Currently, the church manifests only a small part of Christ's totality.<br><br>**IV. Paul's Prayer for the Church (Ephesians 3:14-19):**<br><br>*   Paul prays for the church to be strengthened by the Spirit.<br>*   Christ should dwell in their hearts by faith.<br>*   They should comprehend the breadth, length, depth, and height of Christ.<br>*   This comprehension requires corporate unity ("all saints").<br>*   The goal is to be filled with the fullness of God.<br>*   This "fullness" mirrors the fullness of God in Christ.<br><br>**V. Isaiah's Prophecy (Isaiah 59:19-60:5):**<br><br>*   God's glory will be seen, causing nations to fear Him.<br>*   The enemy (Satan) has come in like a flood.<br>*   The Holy Spirit lifts up a standard against the enemy: Jesus Christ.<br>*   The standard unites God's people around Jesus, not denominations.<br>*   The redeemer comes to Zion (God's people).<br>*   Repentance from transgression is necessary for restoration.<br>*   God's Spirit's restoration is permanent and for all generations.<br>*   Arise, shine: God's light shines amidst growing darkness.<br>*   The choice is clear: light or darkness.<br><br>**VI.
