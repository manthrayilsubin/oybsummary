* **Session 2: Who Am I? - Are You Spiritual or Soulish?**  This session focuses on discerning the difference between spiritual and soulish living, based on a triune understanding of humanity (spirit, soul, body).<br><br>* **Triune Man:**  God, being triune (Father, Son, Holy Spirit), created man in His image (outward likeness) and likeness (inward likeness), resulting in a triune human nature.<br><br>* **Man's Composition:** Man consists of spirit (from God), soul (the union of spirit and body), and body (from the dust).<br><br>* **Satan's Influence:** Satan's temptation targeted man's soul, severing the connection between man's spirit and God, leading to spiritual death, a rebellious soul, and a corruptible body.<br><br>* **The Last Adam (Jesus):** Jesus, the last Adam, bore the penalty for humanity's sin, His resurrection initiating a new creation.<br><br>* **New Birth/Regeneration:**  The new birth involves the Holy Spirit breathing new life into the believer's spirit, restoring connection with God and releasing the soul from Satan's control.  This new life is divine, incorruptible, undefeatable, and indestructible.<br><br>* **Hebrews 4:12:** The Word of God is a living, powerful X-ray, discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart, dividing soul and spirit.<br><br>* **German Psychiatrist's Testimony:** A letter from a German psychiatrist illustrates the transformative power of understanding the triune nature of man and the role of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>* **Effects of Salvation:** Salvation imparts new life to the spirit, restores contact with God, releases the soul from Satan's control, and restores the intended top-down relationship (Spirit, Soul, Body).<br><br>* **Functions of the Three Elements:**<br>    * **Spirit:** God-conscious, communion with God.<br>    * **Soul:** Self-conscious (will, intellect, emotions).<br>    * **Body:** World-conscious (five senses).<br><br>* **1 Corinthians 6:17:**  Illustrates the reality of spiritual union with God, mirroring the physical union.<br><br>* **Union with God:** Worship is the primary activity through which we unite with God.<br><br>* **Jesus and Paul:** Examples of the spirit's influence, demonstrating God's attitudes and responses (sighing, rejoicing, groaning in Spirit; purposing, being bound in Spirit, serving in Spirit).<br><br>* **Soul's Functions:** The soul's three aspects are will ("I want"), intellect ("I think"), and emotions ("I feel").  Unregenerate man is often controlled by these.<br><br>* **The Body's Function:** The body acts out the soul's decisions.<br><br>* **Psalm 103:1-2:** An example of the spirit prompting the soul to praise God, resulting in physical action (speaking).<br><br>* **Hebrews 10:5-7:** God prepared a body for the Messiah to do His will.<br><br>* **Speaking in Tongues:**  A unique instance where the spirit directly operates the body, bypassing the soul's mediating role.<br><br>* **Comparative Activities:**<br>    * **Spirit:** Worship, Revelation, Joy.<br>    * **Soul:** Praise, Theology, Happiness.<br>    * **Body:** Bowing/Kneeling, Sense Perception, Pleasure.<br><br>* **Matthew 16:24-25:**  To follow Jesus requires denying oneself (soul), taking up one's cross, and following Him. This involves saying "no" to the soul's desires, thoughts, and feelings.<br><br>* **Soulishness:**  A state where a person, though born again, has severed their connection with God's Spirit and is controlled by their soul. This often manifests in spiritual language and church attendance, but lacks genuine spiritual fruit.<br><br>* **1 Corinthians 15:44:**  "Natural body" (soulish) versus "spiritual body".<br><br>* **1 Corinthians 2:**  The natural (soulish) man cannot understand spiritual things.<br><br>* **James 3:14-15:**  Bitter envying and self-seeking produce earthly, soulish, demonic wisdom.<br><br>* **Jude 16-19:** Soulish persons cause division in the church.<br><br>* **Soulish Substitutes:**<br>    * **Worship:** Entertainment.<br>    * **Discernment:** Criticism.<br>    * **Conviction:** Guilt.<br>    * **Compassion:** Sympathy.<br>    * **Revelation:** Manipulation.<br><br>* **Matthew 7:**  The ultimate test of spiritual versus soulish is the fruit produced.<br><br><br>
