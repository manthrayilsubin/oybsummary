Here's a summary of the sermon in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**The Sermon's Core Message: God's Restoration Through Covenant**<br><br>* The sermon focuses on God's dual restoration: of Israel (natural) and the Church (spiritual).<br>* It uses Ezekiel's vision of the valley of dry bones as a type and pattern for the Church's restoration.<br>* The key element emphasized is the "sinews" binding the bones together, representing the unity of believers.<br>* The sermon proposes "covenant" as the missing element for strong, lasting unity in the Church.<br><br>**Ezekiel 37: The Valley of Dry Bones**<br><br>* Ezekiel prophesied, causing the bones to come together (bone to bone).<br>* Sinews, flesh, and skin then appeared, but there was no breath yet.<br>* The sinews are crucial for the stability and strength of the joined bones.<br>* This imagery represents believers being brought together in unity.<br><br>**Ephesians 4: The Completed Body of Christ**<br><br>* The ascended Christ gave ministries (apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, teachers).<br>* These ministries are for equipping saints and building up the body of Christ.<br>* The goal is unity of faith through acknowledging the Son of God.<br>* Doctrinal debates hinder unity; exalting Christ fosters it.<br>* The destination is a mature, full-grown body representing the fullness of Christ.<br>* The alternative is remaining immature, tossed by doctrines and deception.<br>* Speaking the truth in love leads to growth in Christ.<br>* The completed body is fitly joined and compacted by what each joint supplies.<br>* Joint supply depends on healthy interpersonal relationships (joints).<br><br>**Colossians 2: Holding the Head**<br><br>* The passage warns against error stemming from not holding the Head (Christ).<br>* It stresses nourishment and unity through joints and bands (sinews/ligaments).<br>* The lack of proper joint function prevents receiving God's provision.<br><br>**The Nature of "Sinews": Covenant**<br><br>* The "sinews" binding believers together are identified as "covenant."<br>* Covenant is a largely forgotten secret for achieving true church unity.<br>* The Hebrew term for the United States ("Land of the Covenant") illustrates this.<br><br>**Covenant Illustrated by Marriage**<br><br>* Marriage, a covenant, involves courtship, commitment, covenant, physical union, and fellowship.<br>* The covenant is crucial; without it, sexual union is fornication.<br>* Church unity suffers from a lack of covenant, resulting in spiritual fornication/adultery.<br><br>**Understanding Covenant**<br><br>* True Christian fellowship needs courtship, commitment, covenant, union, and fellowship.<br>* Covenant is the missing ligament for a strong, stable church.<br>* Covenant requires sacrifice and the shedding of blood (typified in Genesis 17).<br>* God made two covenants with Abraham: one temporary, one everlasting.<br>* The everlasting covenant includes the promise of resurrection.<br><br>**Scriptural Basis for Covenant**<br><br>* Psalm 25: Keeping God's covenant leads to mercy and truth.<br>* Psalm 25:  Iniquity (rebellion) is incompatible with covenant.<br>* Psalm 25: God teaches those who fear Him, revealing His covenant.<br>* Psalm 50: God gathers His saints, those who made a covenant by sacrifice.<br>* Ezekiel 20: God's people will be brought into the "bond of the covenant."<br>* Hebrews 9: A covenant requires the death of the one making it.<br>* 1 John 3: Love involves laying down one's life for the brethren.<br><br>**Covenant and Love**<br><br>* Christian love is a commandment, not merely an emotion.<br>* John 13:  Love one another as Christ loved us (laying down His life).<br>* John 15:  Continuing in Christ's love requires covenant commitment.<br>* Love in marriage (and the Church) requires commitment, not just emotion.<br><br>**Eternal Covenant**<br><br>* The covenant between the Father and the Son is eternal (before the world began).<br>* This covenant is the basis of redemption.<br>* Revelation 11 and 15 reveal the ark of the testament (covenant) in heaven.<br>* 1 Kings 8: The ark of the covenant housed God's covenant with Israel.<br><br>**Practical Application**<br><br>* The sermon calls for a new emphasis on covenant in the Church.<br>* This involves a commitment to one another that transcends personal preferences.<br>* It's a commitment that prioritizes God's will above self-preservation.<br>*  True church unity requires this covenant commitment, mirroring the eternal covenant between the Father and the Son.<br>
