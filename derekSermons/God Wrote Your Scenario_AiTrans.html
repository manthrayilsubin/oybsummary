Here's a summary of the sermon in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**Central Theme: God's Calling and Purpose for Believers**<br><br>* Every Christian has a specific, individual calling from God.<br>* This calling is not separate from salvation; it's integral to it.<br>* God has a unique plan for each person, conceived before time began.<br>*  Ignoring one's calling is a significant tragedy in the Christian life.<br>*  The calling is holy, setting apart the believer and establishing boundaries.<br>*  The calling is not based on works, abilities, education, or social status.<br>* It is based on God's purpose and grace.<br>* God's grace begins where our abilities end.<br>* God's foreknowledge, choice, and predestination determine our calling.<br>* We are not accidents; we are part of God's eternal plan.<br>* God's faithfulness is linked to His calling.<br>* Experiencing God's faithfulness is tied to fulfilling His purpose.<br>* Fellowship with God and others is a primary end, not just a means.<br>* Many churches focus on means (e.g., services) without achieving the end (fellowship).<br>* True fellowship is achieved in various settings beyond church buildings.<br>* God's purpose is to make us completely holy (spirit, soul, body).<br>* God's faithfulness is demonstrated in the fulfillment of His purpose.<br>* We are God's workmanship, created for good works prepared beforehand.<br>* We are God's masterpiece, created from "scrap heap" materials.<br>* God's calling will not be boring; it will be challenging and fulfilling.<br>* God's plan is not an afterthought or emergency measure.<br>* Discovering God's plan involves finding the "scenario" He's written for our lives.<br>* God's faithfulness is seen in aligning with His purpose, not our own.<br>*  The Bible is God's invitation to share in His fellowship.<br>*  We experience God's faithfulness when aligned with His purpose.<br>*  The lack of understanding of God's calling leads to uncertainty about His faithfulness.<br>*  The speaker's personal story illustrates God's calling and faithfulness.<br>*  He discovered his calling through a direct encounter with God.<br>*  His calling was to teach the scriptures in truth, faith, and love.<br>*  God's faithfulness is evident in the reach of his ministry.<br>*  The speaker emphasizes the importance of discipline and dedication.<br>*  He advises against excessive television viewing and advocates for more Bible study.<br>*  Sowing to the flesh leads to corruption (e.g., sickness).<br>*  He uses the analogy of athletes to illustrate dedication and focus.<br>*  Discovering one's calling involves presenting one's body as a living sacrifice.<br>*  This offering sanctifies the body, making it holy and acceptable to God.<br>*  Renewing the mind through this offering helps discover God's will.<br>*  God's will is good, acceptable, and perfect.<br>*  Cultivating one's calling requires focus, discipline, and self-control.<br>*  Staying within one's God-given sphere of ministry is crucial.<br>*  Knowing one's limitations is essential for success.<br>*  There is a "cloud of witnesses" (deceased believers) watching and supporting us.<br>*  Laying aside weights (non-sinful hindrances) is important for the spiritual race.<br>*  A vision from God motivates dedication and sacrifice.<br>*  The speaker emphasizes the importance of total consecration to God.<br>*  He encourages listeners to offer their bodies to God and receive His plan.<br>*  The blood of Jesus cleanses from all sin.<br>*  The speaker concludes with a call to action â€“ to offer oneself totally to God.<br><br><br>This comprehensive summary captures the essence of the lengthy sermon.<br>
