Here's a summary of the lecture in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**On Witchcraft:**<br><br>*   Galatians 3:1 questions the Galatians' backsliding into legalism and carnality, suggesting spiritual deception ("bewitchment").<br>*   Witchcraft is defined as a twin of rebellion, rejecting God's authority and substituting illegitimate power.<br>*   Witchcraft manifests in two ways: as a work of the flesh (unregenerate behavior) and as an evil spiritual power.<br>*   A thin line separates fleshly actions and demonic influence; persistent fleshly sin opens the door to demonic power.<br>*   Examples of witchcraft in the church include manipulative pastoral control and misuse of spiritual gifts (e.g., false prophecy).<br>*   A significant crisis for ministers is determining whether their ministry belongs to them or God.<br>*   The story of Abraham and Isaac illustrates the need to surrender one's ministry (Isaac) to God to receive true blessing.<br>*   Withholding one's "Isaac" results in a corrupted ministry and corrupt fruit.<br>*   Contemporary American Christianity faces the temptation to build ministries through manipulation, intimidation, and domination.<br>*   Fundraising methods can be manipulative (e.g., claiming divine revelation for financial goals).<br>*   Witchcraft uses both enticement and threat to control and dominate.<br>*   The speaker emphasizes the need to avoid witchcraft in fundraising, even while needing significant funds.<br>*   The speaker expresses concern about the ease with which American Christians are manipulated.<br>*   Witchcraft diverts resources from God's intended purposes.<br>*   Genuine revelation from God is possible, but manipulative claims are prevalent.<br><br>**On the Occult and Satan's Influence:**<br><br>*   Witchcraft, as an evil spiritual power, originates from Satan and his angels.<br>*   It's Satan's attempt to reestablish dominion over humanity.<br>*   It's the natural religion of fallen humanity, pervasive across cultures.<br>*   The modern world sees a resurgence of the occult, evident in readily available occult items.<br>*   The occult's infiltration of society is widespread, even among professed Christians.<br>*   The early church faced similar occult influences and remained unaffected.<br>*   Satan is actively seeking to regain lost ground and exert greater influence.<br>*   The occult's appeal lies in its exploitation of humanity's rebellion against God.<br>*   Rebellion against God paves the way for witchcraft.<br>*   Witchcraft aims to replace God's authority with an illegitimate one.<br>*   In Galatia, witchcraft led to a return to legalism and slavery to the flesh, negating the cross's work.<br><br>**Deliverance and the Present Evil Age:**<br><br>*   Galatians provides both the problem (witchcraft) and the solution (deliverance).<br>*   The speaker acknowledges personal struggles with temptation toward manipulation.<br>*   A fivefold deliverance is presented, starting with deliverance from the present evil age (Galatians 1:4).<br>*   "Eon" (age) refers to a long period of time, while "cosmos" (world) signifies a social order apart from God.<br>*   The present evil age is characterized by enmity towards God.<br>*   The church is distinct from the world, a truth crucial for the American church.<br>*   An upcoming revival may increase separation between the world and the church, leading to greater persecution.<br>*   The present evil age is ending, evidenced by the approach of the harvest (Matthew 13).<br>*   This age's end will involve a double harvest: souls for the kingdom and judgment of the wicked.<br>*   The conditions that ripen spiritual fruit also ripen wickedness.<br>*   The end of the age is related to the coming of the Lord (James 5).<br>*   The latter rain of the Holy Spirit is for equipping believers to reap the harvest.<br>*   Satan is the god of this age, blinding unbelievers to the gospel (2 Corinthians 4).<br>*   God's solution isn't to change the age, but to deliver believers from it.<br>*   Hebrews 6 describes experiences (enlightenment, tasting heavenly gifts, the Holy Spirit) common to believers in this age.<br>*   The Holy Spirit serves as a "deposit" (arrhabon), guaranteeing our future inheritance and belonging to God.<br>*   The "deposit" word highlights God's commitment to complete the work He has started.<br><br>
