Here are 50 bulleted points summarizing the sermon:<br><br>**Key Themes: Kingdom of Priests, Ruling through Prayer, Spiritual Warfare**<br><br>* God's redeemed people are called to be a kingdom of priests (Exodus 19:5-6).<br>* This call is reiterated in the New Testament (1 Peter 2:9, Revelation 1:5-6, 5:9-10).<br>* Two options: live as a slave or as a king.  Redemption calls us to kingship.<br>* Many Christians, though potentially kings, live as slaves due to a lack of mental renewal and surrender to God's will.<br>* Deuteronomy 28 outlines blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.<br>* Christians should be "the head and not the tail" and "above only, not beneath," meaning they should be decision-makers, not dragged by circumstances.<br>* Kings rule, priests offer sacrifices.  Priesthood is essential for kingship.<br>* Three New Testament sacrifices: body, lips (praise/thanksgiving), service/giving.<br>* God has destined us to rule by prayer.<br>* We are spiritually located on Mount Zion, with angels, the Church of the firstborn, and Old Testament saints (Hebrews 12:22-24).<br>* Psalm 110:1-2 describes Jesus seated at God's right hand, ruling through His authority (the rod) sent from Zion (His people).<br>* We are co-rulers with Jesus, sharing His authority.<br>* Moses' rod demonstrates the potential power we have through God.<br>* Moses' rod prevailed against the magicians of Pharaoh, demonstrating God's superior power.<br>* Aaron's rod budding, blossoming, and fruiting represents resurrection and Jesus' vindication as Messiah.<br>* The Holy Spirit resurrected Jesus, declaring Him Son of God (Romans 1:4).<br>* Jesus is the faithful witness, firstborn from the dead, and ruler of the kings of the earth (Revelation 1:5).<br>* We share Jesus' ministry as kings and priests (Revelation 1:6).<br>* The rod symbolizes authority; Jesus' name gives it power.<br>* Jesus rules through His assembled people empowered by the Holy Spirit.<br>* We are responsible for bringing Christ's enemies into subjection.<br>* We reign in life through Jesus Christ (Romans 5:17).<br>* God desires us as freewill offerings in His army (Psalm 110:3).<br>* The church must restore the beauty of holiness through surrender.<br>* God is calling young people to be freewill offerings in His army.<br>* Two key thrusts: intercession and evangelism.<br>* Intercessors wield spiritual authority, evangelists spread the Gospel.<br>* Self-centeredness and materialism hinder God's purposes in the church.<br>* The church prepares the way, but Jesus will ultimately establish the Kingdom.<br>* God will judge the wicked (Psalm 110:5-6).<br>* The gospel of the Kingdom must be preached to all nations before the end comes.<br>* We are to demonstrate the Kingdom now through righteousness, peace, and joy.<br>* True righteousness is found only under Jesus' kingship.<br>* The primary purpose of the conference is to bring forth intercession.<br>* Ten major evil forces opposing God:<br>    * Resurgence of old gods/paganism<br>    * Apostasy and division in the church<br>    * Overthrow of law and order/terrorism<br>    * Self-destruction<br>    * Permissiveness, licentiousness, and materialism<br>    * Upsurge of the occult<br>    * Anti-Semitism and anti-Israel sentiment<br>    * Secular humanism<br>    * Marxism<br>    * Islam<br>* The unseen is ultimately real (2 Corinthians 4:17-18).<br>* Intercession is intervening in the unseen world.<br>* Our warfare is spiritual, not physical (Ephesians 6:12, 2 Corinthians 10:3-5).<br>* Spiritual weapons are mighty for pulling down strongholds.<br>* The battlefield is the mind of humanity.<br>* Ideologies are strongholds built in minds to resist the Gospel.<br>* The key responsibilities of the church are intercession and evangelism.<br><br><br>This summary provides a detailed overview of the sermon's main points.
