Here's a summary of the sermon in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**Theme: God's Provision for Holiness**<br><br>* This is the second of four studies on the beauty of holiness.<br>* The first study emphasized God's holiness and His demand for holiness in His people.<br>* God always provides the means for His people to meet His demands.<br>* This study focuses on God's provision for holiness.<br>* Holiness is a unique aspect of God's nature.<br>* God provides for us to partake in His total nature.<br>* Key Scripture: 2 Peter 1:2-4.<br>* Christian life is a life of multiplying grace and peace.<br>* Spiritual growth is essential for a genuine Christian experience.<br>* Knowing God and Jesus Christ is fundamental.<br>* 2 Peter 1:3 states God's divine power has given all things pertaining to life and godliness.<br>* Provision is received through acknowledging Jesus Christ.<br>* Unity in the church comes through acknowledging Christ, not doctrinal debates.<br>* Acknowledging Christ applies to salvation, healing, baptism in the Holy Spirit, and deliverance.<br>* 2 Peter 1:4 states provision is found in God's exceeding great and precious promises.<br>* Slogan: "The provision is in the promises."<br>* Appropriating promises results in partaking of the divine nature.<br>* Partaking of God's nature leads to escaping the world's corruption.<br>* Four key points from 2 Peter 1:3-4:<br>    * Full provision already made.<br>    * Provision comes through acknowledging Christ.<br>    * Provision is in God's promises.<br>    * Appropriating promises results in partaking of God's nature and escaping corruption.<br>* Illustration from Joshua 1:1-3:<br>    * Old Covenant: Promised Land; New Covenant: Land of Promises.<br>    * Joshua (Jesus) leads into inheritance.<br>    * Legal possession vs. experiential possession.<br>* Moses' death parallels the death of the institutional church.<br>* Joshua 1:2-3 shows God's giving in present and past tense â€“ legal and experiential.<br>* Hebrews 12:10 emphasizes partaking in God's holiness.<br>* Seven provisions for holiness:<br>    * Jesus Christ<br>    * The Cross (sacrifice)<br>    * The Holy Spirit<br>    * The Blood of Jesus<br>    * The Word of God<br>    * Faith<br>    * Works (actions expressing faith)<br>* Sanctification is in Christ Jesus (1 Corinthians 1:2, 30).<br>* The cross' sacrifice perfectly perfects those being sanctified (Hebrews 10:14).<br>* Perfect sacrifice vs. progressive appropriation.<br>* The Holy Spirit administers Christ's grace (1 Corinthians 6:11).<br>* God's choice for salvation is through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth (2 Thessalonians 2:13, 1 Peter 1:2).<br>* The blood of Jesus separates us from our sinful past (1 Peter 1:2).<br>* Deliberate rejection of Christ's blood can result in loss of sanctification (Hebrews 10:29).<br>* Jesus' blood sanctifies (Hebrews 13:12).<br>* The Word of God sanctifies (John 17:17, 2 Thessalonians 2:13, Ephesians 5:26-27).<br>* The laver in the Old Testament represents the cleansing of the Word.<br>* Redemption through blood and cleansing through the Word (Exodus 30:18-21, Exodus 38:8).<br>* Three witnesses: blood, water (Word), Spirit (1 John 5:6).<br>* Faith is the means of appropriating God's provision.<br>* Faith without works is dead (James 2:26).<br>* Cleansing ourselves from filthiness of flesh and spirit (2 Corinthians 7:1).<br>* Working out our salvation with fear and trembling (Philippians 2:12-13).<br><br>
