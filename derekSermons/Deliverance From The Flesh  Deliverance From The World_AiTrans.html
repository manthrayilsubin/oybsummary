Here's a summary of the provided text in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**Galatians' Deliverances & The Flesh:**<br><br>*   Galatians highlights five deliverances God offers through Christ's work.<br>*   Three initial deliverances are: freedom from the present evil age (Galatians 1:4), the Law (Galatians 2:19), and self (Galatians 2:20).<br>*   Galatians 5:24 introduces the fourth deliverance: freedom from the flesh.<br>*   "Flesh" refers to the old man's sinful nature, not the physical body.<br>*   "Those who are Christ's" (Galatians 5:24; 1 Corinthians 15:23) are those who have crucified the flesh.<br>*   Jesus returns for those who belong to Him, those who have crucified their flesh.<br>*   This is not a denominational condition; it's a personal spiritual state.<br><br>**Works of the Flesh (Galatians 5:19-21):**<br><br>*   The works of the flesh are evident to others, though not always to the individual.<br>*   They prevent inheriting the kingdom of God.<br>*   Four main categories are identified: sexual impurity, the occult, division, and self-indulgence.<br><br>**Sexual Impurity:**<br><br>*   Encompasses all forms of sexual immorality (fornication, adultery, homosexuality, etc.).<br>*   Biblically condemned as exclusionary from the kingdom of God.<br><br>**The Occult:**<br><br>*   Includes idolatry and sorcery (witchcraft).<br>*   Stems from the flesh's desire for forbidden knowledge.<br>*   Drug use is considered a form of sorcery.<br><br>**Division:**<br><br>*   This is the longest category.<br>*   Includes hatred, contention, jealousy, wrath, selfish ambition, dissension, heresies, and envy.<br>*   Causes divisions within the body of Christ and families.<br><br>**Self-indulgence:**<br><br>*   Includes drunkenness, revelries, and similar excessive behaviors.<br>*   Represents a lack of self-control and is incompatible with the kingdom of God.<br><br>**Carnality & Its Characteristics:**<br><br>*   Carnality (fleshly-mindedness) is identified in 1 Corinthians 3.<br>*   The Corinthians were not condemned for speaking in tongues, but for their divisions and following human leaders.<br>*   Carnality is the root of church division, not theological differences.<br>*   The solution to carnality is the cross.<br><br>**The Enemy Within (The Fifth Column):**<br><br>*   Each person has an internal enemyâ€”the flesh.<br>*   Internal struggles are a sign of spiritual life, not failure.<br>*   The flesh is described as corrupt and incapable of producing good.<br><br>**Paul's Experience & Romans 7-8:**<br><br>*   Paul acknowledges the inherent evil in his flesh (Romans 7:18).<br>*   He struggled to do good despite his desire.<br>*   Romans 8:6-8 contrasts a carnally minded life with a spiritually minded life.<br>*   The carnal mind is enmity against God and cannot be subjected to God's law.<br><br>**God's Solution & Applying the Cross:**<br><br>*   God's solution to the flesh is execution.<br>*   This execution happened on the cross when Jesus died.<br>*   Christians need to apply this already accomplished work of Christ.<br>*   The old man was crucified with Christ (Romans 6:6).<br>*   The body of sin is done away with, freeing from slavery to sin.<br>*   The flesh cannot be completely eliminated in this life but can be rendered ineffective.<br>*   Reckoning oneself as dead to sin is crucial (Romans 6:11).<br><br>**Applying the Provision (Fact, Faith, Feeling):**<br><br>*   The process involves three "F's": Fact (scriptural truth), Faith (belief based on facts), and Feeling (emotions aligned with faith).<br>*   Begin with the facts in scripture, build faith upon them, and let feelings follow.<br>*   Self-confidence can hinder God's presence; brokenness is pleasing to God.<br><br>**Suffering and the Flesh:**<br><br>*   1 Peter 4:1-2 encourages arming oneself with the same mind as Christ to suffer in the flesh.<br>*   Suffering in the flesh involves crucifying the flesh (painful but temporary).<br>*   Suffering leads to ceasing from sin and living for God's will.<br>*   A crisis point often occurs where a choice is made to follow the flesh or crucify it.<br>*   Crucifying the flesh leads to a stronger character and committed life free from sin's dominance.<br><br>
