Here's a summary of the sermon in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**I. Introduction & Core Argument:**<br><br>* The speaker observes many sincere Christians are controlled by emotions rather than decisions.<br>* He emphasizes the importance of making right decisions as an integral part of solving problems.<br>* He uses Psalm 103:1-2 as a springboard, noting David's spirit speaking to his soul.<br>* The speaker outlines the tripartite nature of humanity: spirit, soul, and body.<br>* He argues the spirit is God-conscious, intuitive, and receives revelation, while the soul makes decisions.<br>* The baptism in the Holy Spirit is highlighted as a key experience isolating and liberating the spirit.<br>* He asserts that the spirit knows God and what should be done, but the soul makes the decision.<br>*  The soul is saved through a decision, not just emotion.<br><br>**II. Psalm 103: Benefits of God:**<br><br>* The speaker emphasizes remembering God's benefits to prevent Christians from missing them.<br>* Six benefits are listed from Psalm 103:3-5:<br>    * Forgiveness of iniquities.<br>    * Healing of diseases.<br>    * Redemption from destruction.<br>    * Crowning with lovingkindness and tender mercies.<br>    * Satisfying the mouth with good things.<br>    * Renewal of youth like an eagle's.<br>* He connects the last two benefits, suggesting God's will is for healthy aging.<br>* He shares a personal experience with his mother's illness, highlighting God's intent for healthy aging.<br>* He notes the rarity of believers dying sick in the Bible (except Elisha).<br>* He recounts a story of Brother Jim Brown advising someone to "die well."<br><br>**III. Testimony & Application:**<br><br>* He shares a testimony about a terminally ill man whose life changed after reading Psalm 103 multiple times.<br>* The man's healing is attributed to the power of remembering God's benefits.<br>* He discusses the contrast between the "soulish" (natural) and the spiritual man.<br>* The spiritual man discerns God's will, which the soul then must decide to obey.<br>* The speaker introduces five areas where Christians often rely on emotion instead of decision:<br><br>**IV. Areas Requiring Decision, Not Emotion:**<br><br>* **Repentance:** A change of mind, a decision to turn from a wrong way and submit to God.<br>* He critiques emotional displays without life change in some Pentecostal churches.<br>* He shows the importance of repentance throughout the New Testament (John the Baptist, Jesus, Peter, Paul, Revelation).<br>* He emphasizes repentance as a necessary first step toward receiving forgiveness.<br>* He uses the analogy of a freeway with controlled exits: missing opportunities leads to problems.<br>* **Forgiveness:** A decision to release resentment, not a feeling.  It's likened to tearing up an IOU.<br>* He encourages forgiveness even toward those who have severely wronged us.<br>* Forgiving others is a prerequisite for receiving God's forgiveness (Mark 11:25-26).<br>* He addresses the common objection, "I don't *feel* like forgiving," emphasizing the will over emotion.<br>* **Praise:** A decision to praise God regardless of feelings.<br>* Psalm 34:1-2 is used to show praise should be continuous, not emotional.<br>* He points out David's praise in difficult circumstances as an example.<br>* He connects praise with crucifying the flesh and overcoming negative emotions.<br>* Psalm 63:3-4 is also used to demonstrate the decision to praise.<br>* **Speaking in Tongues:** A willful decision, not an emotional impulse.<br>* 1 Corinthians 14:15 is cited, emphasizing "I will" pray and sing in the Spirit and understanding.<br>* He critiques the practice of only speaking in tongues in extremes (peak spiritual experience or crisis).<br>* 1 Corinthians 14:2-4 is referenced to show speaking in tongues is communicating with God, speaking mysteries, and edifying oneself.<br>* Jude 20-21 is quoted, showing praying in the Spirit is key to building up one's faith amidst ungodliness.<br>* He encourages regular practice of speaking in tongues as a responsibility.<br>* **Active Participation:** Overcoming passivity by actively engaging faith.<br>* Acts 2:4 shows the believers *began* to speak, highlighting human agency in receiving the Holy Spirit.<br>* He uses the prodigal son's return as an illustration of decisive repentance and action.<br>* He encourages active participation in praising God (e.g., dancing, etc.).<br>* He advocates taking action to claim healing instead of passively waiting.<br><br><br>**V. Conclusion & Call to Action:**<br><br>* The speaker gives a call to action, prompting people to make decisions in the areas discussed.<br>* He encourages those needing to repent, forgive, praise, or engage in spiritual practices to raise their hands.<br>* Many people respond, signifying their willingness to make these decisions.<br>* The sermon closes with prayer for those who have made commitments.<br><br>
