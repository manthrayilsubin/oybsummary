Here's a summary of the lecture in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**The Three Vocal Gifts of the Holy Spirit:**<br><br>*   Tongues, interpretation, and prophecy are the three vocal gifts.<br>*   Tongues can be used singularly (unknown/new/another tongue) or plurally (kinds of tongues).<br><br>**Singular Use of Tongues (Unknown Tongue): Three Purposes**<br><br>*   **Initial:** Culmination of Spirit baptism; supernatural outflow from supernatural infilling.<br>*   Evidence of Spirit baptism accepted by the apostles.<br>*   No other specific alternative evidence is mentioned in the New Testament.<br>*   **Occasional:** Supernatural sign to unbelievers (1 Corinthians 14:21-22).<br>*   Believer speaks an unknown language, unbeliever understands.<br>*   Unbeliever acknowledges God's supernatural intervention.<br>*   Day of Pentecost exemplifies all facets of tongues, including this sign.<br>*   Acts 2 describes unbelievers amazed at hearing Galileans speak their languages.<br>*   It was a miracle of speaking, not just hearing (Acts 2:11).<br>*   Unbelievers were "ecstatic" (amazed, astonished).<br>*   The sign compelled attention, leading to Peter's preaching.<br>*   Fulfillment of Isaiah 28:11-12 prophecy.<br>*   Isaiah 28:11: God speaks to Israel with "stammering lips and another tongue."<br>*   Isaiah 28:12: Israel's rejection despite the supernatural sign.<br>*   This sign still occurs today, evidenced by anecdotes from London and Berlin.<br>*   London example: Elderly Englishman speaks Welsh, understood by a Welshman.<br>*   Berlin example: German women speaking flawless English with a Midwest accent.<br><br>**Continual Use of Tongues (Unknown Tongue):**<br><br>*   **Continual:** Regular, repeated use (1 Corinthians 14:2-4).<br>*   Speaks to God, not men.<br>*   Speaks mysteries (things the mind doesn't understand).<br>*   Edifies (builds up) the speaker.<br>*   1 Corinthians 14:14: Praying in tongues allows the spirit to pray while the mind rests.<br>*   Contemporary Christianity is often mind-dominated, neglecting the spirit.<br>*   The spirit needs to be cultivated, not just the mind or body.<br>*   Spirit baptism dethrones the mind, allowing the spirit to lead.<br>*   Mind is a tool, not the master.<br><br>**Contrasting Tongues and Prophecy:**<br><br>*   Tongues speak to God, prophecy speaks to men.<br>*   Tongues speak mysteries, prophecy speaks understandable words.<br>*   Tongues edify the speaker, prophecy edifies the church.<br><br>**Praying in Tongues:**<br><br>*   Praying in tongues is praying with the spirit, not the understanding.<br>*   The will, not feelings, determines whether to pray in tongues or in a known language.<br>*   One can pray, sing, or bless with the spirit (in tongues).<br>*   It's important to consider unbelievers present when choosing how to pray.<br>*   Praying in tongues is a scriptural obligation, barring offense to others.<br>*   Smith Wigglesworth: "I'm never moved by what I feel; I'm only moved by what I believe."<br>*   The spirit initiates prayer; the soul makes the decision.<br>*   Singing in tongues is possible; God provides the language and melody.<br><br>**The Spirit of Man:**<br><br>*   1 Corinthians 2:11: The spirit of man knows the things of man.<br>*   The spirit knows things the mind doesn't, including hidden wounds and traumas.<br>*   Spirit baptism releases inner tensions and heals wounds.<br>*   1 John 3:8: The Son of God was manifested to "destroy" (untie) the works of the devil.<br>*   The soulish (mind-dominated) man does not receive the things of the Spirit.<br>*   Spiritual things are discerned spiritually, not intellectually.<br>*   1 Corinthians 6:17: He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.<br>*   Hebrews 4:12-13: The Word of God divides soul and spirit.<br><br>**Location of the Spirit in the Body:**<br><br>*   John 7:38: "Rivers of living water" flow from the belly (inner hollow area).<br>*   Job 32:8, 18-19: "Spirit in man" constrains Elihu to speak, like fermenting wine.<br>*   Proverbs 18:8: Words wound the innermost parts of the belly (wounded spirit).<br>*   Proverbs 18:14: A wounded spirit is hard to bear.<br>*   Proverbs 20:27: The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord, illuminating inward parts.<br>*   Psalm 51:6: God desires truth in the inward parts.<br><br>**Praying in the Spirit (in Tongues):**<br><br>*   Ephesians 6:18: Praying always with all prayer and supplication *in* the Spirit.<br>*   1 Thessalonians 5:16-19: Pray without ceasing; quench not the Spirit.<br>*   Jude 20-21: Building up yourselves on your faith by praying in the Holy Spirit.<br>*   Romans 8:26-27: The Spirit helps our infirmities in prayer; makes intercession for us.<br>*   Zechariah 12:10: Spirit of grace and of supplications poured upon the house of David.<br><br>**Rejection of the Holy Spirit:**<br><br>*   Rejecting the Holy Spirit is a grave spiritual danger.<br>*   Israel's rejection of the Spirit serves as a warning.<br>*   America's future depends on its response to the Holy Spirit's work.<br><br>
