Here's a 50-point bulleted summary of the sermon, focusing on key concepts and avoiding redundancy:<br><br>**Recap of Last Night's Message & Introduction:**<br><br>*   Recap of previous night's sermon: Spiritual laws are as unbreakable as physical laws.<br>*   Theme: A spiritual law stated thrice by Jesus: "Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."<br>*   The "way up is down."  Attempting self-exaltation leads to humiliation.<br>*   Lucifer's fall as a negative example of this law.<br><br>**Lucifer's Fall & Jesus' Exaltation:**<br><br>*   Lucifer (Satan) exemplified self-exaltation leading to a fall.<br>*   Jesus, conversely, exemplified humility leading to exaltation.<br>*   Jesus' life perfectly contrasts Satan's:  Stooped down to be lifted up.<br>*   This principle applies universally, across all times and situations.<br><br>**Philippians 2: Seven Steps Down & Seven Steps Up:**<br><br>*   Philippians 2:5-11 illustrates the seven steps of Jesus' descent:<br>    *   Emptied Himself<br>    *   Took the form of a servant<br>    *   Made in human likeness<br>    *   Found in appearance as a man<br>    *   Humbled Himself<br>    *   Became obedient to death<br>    *   Death on a cross<br>*   Seven steps of Jesus' exaltation (following "Therefore"):<br>    *   Exalted to the highest place<br>    *   Given the name above every name<br>    *   Every knee shall bow (in heaven)<br>    *   Every knee shall bow (on earth)<br>    *   Every knee shall bow (under the earth)<br>    *   Every tongue confesses Jesus Christ is Lord<br>    *   To the glory of God the Father<br>*   Exaltation follows fulfilling the conditions of humility.  This is a divine law, not mere happenstance.<br><br>**Applying the Principle to Personal Life:**<br><br>*   Humility is a decision of the will, not just an emotion.<br>*   Working out salvation with fear and trembling involves this principle.<br>*   Humility leads to obedience; pride leads to disobedience.<br>*   No complaining or arguing; strive for blamelessness and purity.<br>*   Shining as stars involves holding out the word of life.<br>*   The goal is producing good people, not just good sermons.<br>*   James 4:10 and 1 Peter 5:5-6 reiterate the principle of humbling oneself before the Lord.<br>*   God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.<br>*   "Clothe yourselves with humility" (or "wear the overalls of humility").<br>*   God humbles us by creating circumstances requiring humility.  The choice to be humble remains ours.<br>*   Suffering unjustly for doing good is commendable; it cultivates humility.<br>*   Following Jesus' example involves enduring unjust suffering.<br>*   Humility is a decision, not merely a feeling. It must be acted upon.<br><br>**Humility in Coming to God & Spiritual Progress:**<br><br>*   Coming to God requires childlike humility (Matthew 18:1-4).<br>*   God chooses the foolish, weak, lowly, and despised to prevent boasting.<br>*   The rich ruler's story (Luke 18) illustrates the necessity of relinquishing wealth and pride to enter the kingdom.<br>*   Naaman's story (2 Kings 5) shows the need for complete obedience and humility, even in seemingly simple tasks.  Partial obedience is insufficient.<br>*   Spiritual progress requires ongoing humility.  It's not a one-time event.<br>*   God uses trials to prevent pride (2 Corinthians 12:7-10).<br>*   God's power is made perfect in weakness.<br>*   Boasting in weakness brings God's glory.<br><br>**Humility in Leadership & Relationships:**<br><br>*   Humility is the greatest qualification for leadership (Matthew 20).<br>*   True greatness lies in servanthood (Matthew 20).<br>*   Approaching others with a desire to serve, rather than to help, is crucial.<br>*   The story of Abraham and Lot (Genesis 13) exemplifies humility in relationships.  Abraham's humility led to God's blessing.<br>*   Taking risks is inherent in faith and obedience.<br>*   Jacob's wrestling match (Genesis 32) and his limp symbolize the humbling process.<br>*   Jacob's humility before Esau shows the power of humility in reconciliation.<br>*   The spiritual person should humble themselves before the carnal.<br>*   The test of our relationship with God is how we treat others.<br>*   Philippians 2:3 calls to consider others better than ourselves.<br>*   Ephesians 5:21 emphasizes mutual submission out of reverence for Christ.<br>*   Humility is essential in both our relationship with God and others.  One cannot be truly humble towards God while being proud towards others.<br><br><br>This summary provides a comprehensive overview of the sermon's key points.<br>
