Here's a summary of the lecture in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**The Last Days Theme:**<br><br>*   Focus on the period before Jesus Christ's return.<br>*   Many Bible books reference the last days.<br>*   Last days bring extraordinary pressures and opportunities.<br>*   Knowledge of God's word is crucial for survival and seizing opportunities.<br>*   Distorted prophecies cause prejudice against true prophecy.<br>*   Even the gospel has been perverted, but this doesn't invalidate truth.<br>*   Moses (Deut. 29:29) distinguishes between revealed and secret things.<br>*   Distorted prophecies focus on the secret, ignoring the revealed.<br>*   Apparent contradictions exist: good and bad coexist.<br>*   Christians often focus on one side of the truth and ignore the other.<br><br>**Light and Darkness:**<br><br>*   Isaiah 60:1-3: light and glory for God's people amidst increasing darkness.<br>*   Exodus 10:21-23: darkness on Egypt, light on Israel.<br>*   Genesis 15:5: Abraham's descendants like the stars in number and brilliance.<br>*   Galatians 3: believers are Abraham's seed through faith.<br>*   A dramatic incident in Seattle illustrated this contrast (demon expulsion).<br>*   God's people shine most brilliantly in deepest darkness.<br><br>**Wheat and Tares:**<br><br>*   Matthew 13: parable of wheat and tares growing together until harvest.<br>*   Field is the world; good seed are God's people; tares are the wicked.<br>*   Harvest is the end of the age; reapers are angels.<br>*   God doesn't authorize us to discern wheat from tares.<br>*   Discernment is based on fruit (wheat bears fruit, tares don't).<br>*   Same climate ripens both wheat and tares (permissiveness).<br>*   New Zealand example: both good and evil are ripening.<br><br>**Ripening of Good and Evil:**<br><br>*   Revelation 22:10-12: unjust remain unjust, righteous remain righteous (or even more so).<br>*   God allows the wicked to show their true nature.<br>*   Even the wicked serve God's purposes (Prov. 16:4).<br>*   Emphasis on vigilance (Mark 13).<br><br><br>**2 Timothy 3: Characteristics of the Last Days:**<br><br>*   Perilous times (times of stress).<br>*   Human nature as the source of problems; corruption is irreversible.<br>*   Eighteen marks of moral degeneration (self-love, money-love, boasting, pride, etc.).<br>*   Love of self, money, and pleasure characterize the culture.<br>*   Form of godliness but denying its power.<br>*   Selfishness as the root problem.<br>*   Many churchgoers are selfish, focusing on self-gain.<br>*   Unscrupulous teachers exploiting gullible women.<br>*   Always learning but never coming to the knowledge of the truth.<br>*   Proliferation of the occult; openly flaunted.<br>*   Jannes and Jambres resisting Moses; occult resistance to the gospel.<br>*   Victory requires supernatural power (demonstrations of power).<br>*   Evil men and impostors (enchanters) will grow worse.<br>*   Christians will face persecution.<br><br>**Remedy and Safeguard:**<br><br>*   Continue in what's learned from scripture (2 Tim 3:14-17).<br>*   Scripture is inspired and profitable for every good work.<br>*   All scripture is necessary for complete equipment.<br>*   Faith as the shield, the word of God as the sword.<br>*   Focus on salvation, the blood of Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and Christ's return.<br>*   Avoid getting sidetracked by minor issues.<br>*   Hold fast to the absolute authority of God's word.<br>*   Prayer for faithfulness to God's word.<br><br>
