Here's a summary of the lecture in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**Hebrews 11: Examples of Faith & Principles**<br><br>*   The study uses "E" for examples of faith and "P" for principles.<br>*   E.1: Abel's acceptable sacrifice.<br>*   E.2: Enoch walked with God.<br>*   E.3: Noah built the ark.<br>*   E.4: Abraham obeyed God's call, sojourned in Canaan.<br>*   E.5: Sarah conceived Isaac in old age.<br>*   The session focuses on E.6: Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac (Hebrews 11:17-19).<br><br>**Abraham and Isaac: Hebrews 11:17-19 & Genesis 21:12, 22**<br><br>*   Hebrews 11:17 uses the word "offered" implying a sacrifice.<br>*   "Only begotten son" – same word used for Jesus, implying uniqueness.<br>*   Genesis 21:12: God instructs Abraham to listen to Sarah concerning Isaac's inheritance.<br>*   The promise of inheritance was through Isaac, not Ishmael.<br>*   Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac was the ultimate test of faith.<br>*   Genesis 22 details the near-sacrifice: God's test, Abraham's obedience.<br>*   The phrase "we will worship and we will return" (Genesis 22:5) reveals Abraham's faith in resurrection.<br><br>**Abraham and Isaac as a Parable of Calvary**<br><br>*   The story prefigures Calvary/Golgotha ("place of the skull").<br>*   Parables use the known to explain the unknown, proceeding from sense to faith.<br>*   Abraham represents God the Father, Isaac represents Jesus.<br>*   The fire represents the Holy Spirit, the wood represents the cross.<br>*   The young men represent natural strength and understanding, left behind.<br>*   The ram represents Jesus, the substitute, caught by his strength (obedience).<br>*   Genesis 24 (Abraham finding a wife for Isaac) is another parable: Abraham=Father, Isaac=Jesus, bride=Church, servant=Holy Spirit.<br><br>**Results and Blessings**<br><br>*   The result of Abraham's obedience: limitless blessing and multiplication.<br>*   What you keep, you lose; what you give up, you gain (multiplied).  John 12:24-25.<br>*   Genesis 22:15-18: God's oath to bless Abraham and multiply his seed (singular, referring to Christ).<br>*   Galatians 3:16: The promise was to one seed, Christ.<br><br>**Isaac's Blessing: Genesis 27**<br><br>*   Isaac unknowingly blessed Jacob instead of Esau.  The blessing was irrevocable.<br>*   P.10: Faith can make decrees with divine authority.  Job 22:26-28; Mark 11:22-23.<br><br>**Jacob's Blessing: Genesis 47**<br><br>*   Jacob blessed Joseph's sons, worshiping at the head of his staff/bed.<br>*   The younger son (Ephraim) was blessed above the elder (Manasseh).<br>*   Worship is an expression of faith (Exodus 4:31; 2 Chronicles 20:18).<br><br>**Joseph's Commandment: Exodus 13:19; Joshua 24:32**<br><br>*   Joseph commanded that his bones be taken to Canaan.<br>*   P.6: Faith inspires hope beyond this life.<br>*   P.8: Faith looks forward and upward, not back.<br><br>**Moses's Life: Examples of Faith**<br><br>*   E.9: Moses's birth and hiding (Exodus 2:1-2).<br>*   P.11: Faith delivers from fear of ungodly rulers.<br>*   E.10: Moses renounces Pharaoh's court (Hebrews 11:24-26).<br>*   Moses considered the reproach of the Anointed (Messiah) greater than Egypt's treasures (Psalm 89:50-51).<br>*   The reproach of Christ: identification with God's people invites opposition.<br>*   Result: Moses passed his first test.<br><br>**Moses's Exodus and Endurance:**<br><br>*   E.11: Moses leaves Egypt, not fearing Pharaoh's wrath (Hebrews 11:27).<br>*   He endured "as seeing Him who is invisible."<br>*   Result: Moses passed his second test.<br>*   P.12: Seeing the invisible is the key to endurance (2 Corinthians 4:17-18).<br>*   Solomon's cynicism resulted from focusing on "things under the sun."<br><br><br>This detailed outline covers the main points and supporting scriptures discussed in the lecture.
