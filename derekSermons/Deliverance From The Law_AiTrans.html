Here's a summary of the sermon in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**Deliverance from the Present Evil Age:**<br><br>*   Galatians reveals a fivefold deliverance.<br>*   The first deliverance is from the present evil age (Galatians 1:4).<br>*   The present age is drawing to a close (Matthew 13).<br>*   Satan is the god of this age.<br>*   Through the Holy Spirit, we've tasted the powers of the next age (Hebrews).<br>*   "Cares of this age" can choke the Word (Matthew 13:22).<br>*   A standard for evaluating concerns: importance in 1 year, 10 years, eternity.<br>*   Concerns don't need to be sinful, but can assume wrong proportions.<br>*   Worries of this world can keep us from meeting Jesus (Corrie Ten Boom).<br>*   Don't be conformed to this age (Romans 12:2).<br>*   Conformity is primarily in thinking, not just outward appearance.<br>*   Renewing of the mind is crucial for discovering God's will (Romans 12:2).<br>*   Unrenewed minds cannot discover God's will.<br>*   Demas forsook Paul because he loved this present age (2 Timothy 4:10).<br>*   Loving this age can lead to neglecting Christ's claims.<br>*   Demas's "love" wasn't necessarily open sin, but misplaced affection.<br>*   Thank God the present age is ending because it's in a mess.<br><br>**Results of Deliverance from the Present Evil Age:**<br><br>*   Citizenship in heaven (Philippians 3).<br>*   Challenge to follow the speaker's example (Philippians 3:17).<br>*   Enemies of the cross of Christ are those focused on earthly things (Philippians 3).<br>*   Our citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20).<br>*   We seek a city to come, not a continuing city here (Hebrews 13:14).<br>*   Hope only in this life makes us pitiable (1 Corinthians 15:19).<br>*   Expectation of Christ's return is a result of deliverance.<br>*   Christ's return is for those who eagerly wait for Him (Hebrews 9:28).<br>*   Those who love His appearing will receive a crown of righteousness (2 Timothy 4:8).<br>*   "Crown" refers to a wreath (stephanos), not a diadem.<br>*   The crown of righteousness is a reward for longing for Christ's return.<br>*   Results are inconsistent with loving the present age.<br>*   We should prize our heavenly citizenship.<br><br>**Deliverance from the Law:**<br><br>*   Second deliverance: from the law (Galatians 2:19).<br>*   Paul died to the law to live to Christ.<br>*   Death to the law is necessary to live to Christ.<br>*   Crucial issue for Jewish believers.<br>*   Colossians 2:20-23 warns against regulations of this age.<br>*   Regulations have an appearance of wisdom but are of no value.<br>*   Rules often stimulate fleshly lusts.<br><br>**Results of Deliverance from the Law:**<br><br>*   Freedom from condemnation (Romans 8:1).<br>*   The law points out sin, but doesn't provide the solution.<br>*   God fulfilled the law's righteous requirement through Christ (Romans 8:4).<br>*   The righteous requirement of the law is love.<br>*   Outworked righteousness (dikaioma) is necessary for the marriage supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:8).<br>*   Imputed and outworked righteousness.<br>*   Owe no one anything except to love one another (Romans 13:8).<br>*   Love fulfills the law (Romans 13:8-10).<br>*   Faith working through love (Galatians 5:6).<br>*   All the law is fulfilled in loving your neighbor (Galatians 5:14).<br>*   The goal of instruction is love (1 Timothy 1:5).<br>*   Love unites with obedience.<br>*   Love is the most powerful motivation.<br>*   James calls the law of love the "royal law" and "law of liberty" (James 1:25, 2:8, 2:12).<br>*   Freedom to be led by the Holy Spirit (Romans 6:14).<br>*   Being led by the Spirit is for mature sons of God (Romans 8:14-15).<br>*   Cannot be led by the Spirit and under the law simultaneously (Galatians 5:18).<br>*   Freedom to love, not freedom to do evil.<br><br><br>
