Here's a summary of the sermon in 50 bulleted points:<br><br>**I. The Concept of Koinonia (Fellowship):**<br><br>*   The New Testament uses the Greek word "koinonia" for fellowship.<br>*   Koinonia derives from "koinin," meaning common or shared.<br>*   Koinonia signifies sharing things in common.<br>*   It's a key concept in New Testament Christianity.<br>*   Fellowship is the ultimate goal (the "end") of the Gospel.<br><br>**II. Fellowship as the End, Not Just a Means:**<br><br>*   The speaker distinguishes between ends and means.<br>*   An end is desirable for itself; a means is desirable only if it achieves the end.<br>*   Many Christians focus on means (practices, organization) and forget the end (fellowship).<br>*   The speaker suggests 80% of religious activity might cease if people truly assessed their ends and means.<br>*   Religious institutions often prioritize self-preservation over achieving their original purpose.<br><br>**III.

Fellowship as a Testing Place:**<br><br>*   Fellowship reveals our spiritual state.<br>*   Lack of fellowship indicates a lack of light and cleansing.<br>*   Isaiah 31:9: God's fire (purification) is in Zion (fellowship).<br>*   Fellowship is a refining process.<br>*   The analogy of smooth stones in the brook: fellowship refines and prepares us for God's use.<br><br>**V.  Fellowship and the Godhead:**<br><br>*   Three eternal aspects of the Godhead: Fatherhood, headship, and fellowship.<br>*   The Holy Spirit can be seen as the love relationship between Father and Son.<br>*   God's purposes originate in the fellowship of the Godhead.<br>*   Examples from Genesis and Isaiah illustrate God's actions as decisions made in the fellowship of the Godhead.<br><br>**VI. Fellowship and Spiritual Birth:**<br><br>*   John 3:6: Flesh begets flesh; Spirit begets spirit.<br>*   Fellowship is the birthplace of spiritual things;  no fellowship, no spiritual birth.<br>*   Church structures often hinder fellowship.<br>*   Acts 1:14: Ten days of prayer and supplication (fellowship) preceded Pentecost.<br>*   Acts 2:42:  The early church was steadfast in doctrine, fellowship, breaking bread, and prayer.<br>*   Acts 13:1-3:  The first missionary journey originated in fellowship.<br>*   1 John 5:4, 18: What is born of God overcomes the world and is protected from evil.<br>*   The Pilgrim Fathers' success stemmed from their spiritual birth in fellowship.<br><br>**VII.
