<p data-content-id="YZd3qYEC_Jda-QZIySyXhCTyuVfqZDCLDOMiHe6ZqJcT3kW7rxFLTl4OULbtbcSz8"> The beginning of 3 John is similar to that of 2 John. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104839" data-verses="3John 1:1">verse 1</span> the apostle John says, “The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.” Like Peter, John was an elder in the church at Jerusalem before its destruction in A.D. 70. According to history, after returning from exile, John stayed in Ephesus to care for the churches in Asia. Probably he was an elder in the church at Ephesus, where he wrote this Epistle. </p>
<p data-content-id="ETIQog5561IA9PRhma4Ub40bzJEhm8oe_-yF8XNEBd2-HrS2HD9nuGa0rCIJ8rB6v"> The Epistle of 3 John is addressed to “Gaius the beloved.” This is not the Gaius of Macedonia (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104840" data-verses="Acts 19:29">Acts 19:29</span>), the Gaius of Derbe (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104841" data-verses="Acts 20:4">Acts 20:4</span>), nor the Gaius of Corinth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104842" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:14">1 Cor. 1:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104843" data-verses="Romans 16:23">Rom. 16:23</span>), but another with the name of Gaius, a name that was very common at the time. According to the contents of this Epistle, Gaius must have been an outstanding brother in the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="CIozRtTLLqGr_Ka3hqL-Byxv2YPyT9h5clnZTlxr0Zpm8ePnggeyuLepQBQZvnEjv"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104844" data-verses="3John 1:1">verse 1</span> John speaks of loving Gaius in truth. Here “truth” denotes the revealed divine reality—the Triune God dispensed into man in the Son Jesus Christ—becoming man’s genuineness and sincerity, to live a life that corresponds to the divine light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104845" data-verses="John 3:19-21">John 3:19-21</span>) and to worship <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> God, as God seeks, according to what He is (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104846" data-verses="John 4:23-24">John 4:23-24</span>). This is the virtue of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104847" data-verses="Romans 3:7">Rom. 3:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104848" data-verses="Romans 15:8">15:8</span>) becoming our virtue, by which we love the believers. In such truth, the apostle John, who lived in the divine reality of the Trinity, loved Gaius the beloved. </p>

Probably the word “wish” is used in the sense of prayer. Literally, the Greek word for “prosper” here means to have a good journey, to go on well, that is, to succeed in reaching a desired end; thus, to prosper. “Health” here is bodily health, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104850" data-verses="Luke 5:31">Luke 5:31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104851" data-verses="Luke 7:10">7:10</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104852" data-verses="Luke 15:27">15:27</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="pTbs60E_bOiHPvS-y9ZVrL8Ux95NmJ-DbrGcWPn9_pBVf4hsHEL2x84JVClHhbntm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104853" data-verses="3John 1:2">verse 2</span> John speaks of the soul prospering. Man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104854" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">1 Thes. 5:23</span>). The soul is the mediating organ between the body and the spirit, possessing self-consciousness, that man may have his personality. The soul is contained in the body and is the vessel to contain the spirit. With the believer, God as the Spirit dwells in his regenerated spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104855" data-verses="Romans 8:9">Rom. 8:9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104856" data-verses="Romans 8:16">16</span>) and spreads from his spirit to saturate his soul, that it may be transformed to express Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104857" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Rom. 12:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104858" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Cor. 3:18</span>). This is the prosperity of the believer’s soul. When our soul is occupied and directed by the Spirit of God through our spirit to direct and use our body for God’s purposes, it prospers. The apostle wishes that the one who receives his Epistle, who is a beloved brother, outstanding in such prosperity of his soul, may prosper in all things and in bodily health, just as his soul prospers in the divine life. </p>
<p data-content-id="vHuqG0u9o2ZcDGSUo9lMDsEe8j1S3XT99MOTbYQNmoKZn1yUrmV8aVDfKQP0HSGfa"> Our body may prosper in health, and our living may prosper in many material things. However, our soul needs to prosper in the divine life. What, then, is the prosperity of our soul? The prosperity of our soul is the spreading of the divine life into the soul. Through regeneration the divine life has been imparted to our spirit. Now from our spirit this <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> life needs to spread into our soul. If this takes place, our soul will prosper by the spreading of the divine life into it. I hope that we all shall pursue this so that we will have adequate experience of the prospering of our soul through the spreading of the divine life into it. </p>
<p data-content-id="WuU0PL98RPIezjeo8opriapgn-ZrMRV_275MhBqE6258P6CS-0skaZZzURGHczTEY"> The beloved brother Gaius was prospering in his soul. The apostle John wished that this brother would not only prosper in his soul, but also prosper in material things and that he would be in health. This greeting here is particular; it is unique in the entire Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="25pdw5aXXGBlIVETkj5ozP4CyiXbxLVB9OLeZU8HISUYQsvJ3OajsdcdGnzHH7GJB"> The New Testament is a book on spiritual prosperity, not on material things or bodily health. Nevertheless, John, who writes concerning divine things, wished that the one who received this letter would prosper in bodily health and even in material things. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="uIdnQiuxfRsyScGyAmZt4e407sjcC_GaWFEtkj80uAyJywqeHWzCsXxZunqEaNgRq">Walking in Truth</h2><p data-content-id="fb3irlLbqQbd47ryXqI_f679QG3k3MkClDZoqCyduVe1CbAYl3CqsM751-bra6fCm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104859" data-verses="3John 1:3">verse 3</span> John goes on to say, “For I rejoiced greatly at the brothers coming and testifying to your truth, even as you walk in truth.” The truth concerning the Person of Christ is the basic and central element of John’s mending ministry. When he found that his children were walking in truth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104860" data-verses="3John 1:4">v. 4</span>), he rejoiced greatly. To walk in truth means that the Triune God becomes our enjoyment in reality. Therefore, our daily walk is the walk in truth, which is the reality of the Triune God enjoyed by us. </p>
<p data-content-id="IhWY1FO06P_e8svDOAKzn9E5JkaVT18xlNiA__6O0rwkIA9Bs0Z4uBseyx5bBVDBP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104861" data-verses="3John 1:3">verse 3</span> John speaks of “your truth.” “Your truth” is the truth concerning Christ, especially His deity, by the revelation of which the recipient’s way of life is determined and to which the recipient holds as his fundamental belief. The thought here is deep. John’s thought is that the objective truth becomes ours. Hence, the truth becomes subjective to us in our daily walk. This truth is the reality of Christ’s deity. Our life is determined and shaped by the revelation of this truth. This means that we live, walk, and behave in the divine reality of the Triune God, who is our enjoyment. This enjoyment shapes our walk, our way of life. This indicates that our way of life is determined, shaped, molded by what <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> we believe concerning the Person of Christ and by what we have seen and enjoyed of this reality. This truth is actually the Triune God becoming our enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="HhPOy5X1GTFHxxqqFBKyQDjBzYLfuwaX7wiKZOQ_AGL8HvVonY5iXLJoxlYmEV_VW"> We believe that the Triune God became a man and lived on earth, died on the cross for our redemption, and in resurrection became a life-giving Spirit. Now this life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. This Spirit is the consummation of all that the Father is and of all that the Son is as a person possessing divinity and humanity. Christ the Son is the very God and also a real man, who has accomplished redemption and is now the Life-giver, the life-imparting Spirit. We believe this, and this belief now shapes, determines, molds, our way of life. This is what it means to walk in truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="XlXUROwsYk4m_dxDDXHkKR_oLCJljZkOWnaHoXmqxMjlrKG7u8Y-VkB9IzbqrlgiW"> The philosophy a person holds will determine his way of life. What a person believes will always shape his living. We Christians walk in the divine truth. This means that our way of life is determined, shaped, molded, by the divine reality—the Triune God Himself—which we enjoy. </p>
<p data-content-id="kUpzi61rbt9UorFSb0BcN8dQIT2KQy2-C4R9ARmoNlTRTtK7gVEy502CW5eKOLLol"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104862" data-verses="3John 1:3">verse 3</span> John says to Gaius, “Even as you walk in truth.” The one who receives this word not only holds to the truth, but also walks and lives in the truth. The truth concerning the Person of Christ should not only be our belief, but should also be our living, a living that testifies to our belief. The truth in which we walk, therefore, becomes our truth in our daily life. </p>
<p data-content-id="J2SuO66E9E-vXuWY65wdIci87IXWuWljM_O6pfWWPmT-ZWL4GLMGMN-rFESxCFwvB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104863" data-verses="3John 1:4">verse 4</span> John continues, “I have no greater joy than these things, that I hear that my children are walking in the truth.” As in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104864" data-verses="2John 1:4">2 John 4</span>, “truth” here is the divine reality, especially concerning the Person of Christ as revealed in John’s Gospel and first Epistle, that is, that Christ is both God and man, having both deity and humanity, possessing both the divine nature and the human nature, to express God in human life and to accomplish redemption with divine power in human flesh for fallen human beings so that He may impart the divine life into them and bring them into an organic union with God. The second and third Epistles of John emphasize this truth. The second warns the faithful <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> believers against receiving those who do not abide in this truth, and the third encourages the believers to receive and help those who work for it. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104895" data-verses="3John 1:9">verse 9</span> John says, “I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us.” The church here is the church of which Gaius was a member. </p>
<p data-content-id="U_Zw0QhRb8zAZIdmgKlJm3uqUW8Sv8lu4UDWQg9c2cDAoLIQ85g9n0ZDLcUVIx53z"> The name Diotrephes is made up of <em>Dios</em> (from the name of Zeus, who was the chief of the gods in the Greek pantheon) and <em>trepho,</em> to nourish; hence, Zeus-nourished. This indicates that Diotrephes as a professing Christian never dropped his pagan name. This was contrary to the practice of the early believers, who took a Christian name at their baptism. According to history, Diotrephes advocated the Gnostic heresy, which blasphemes the Person of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="MKlgQB-WzU_QT-qKDpqQgHC3IdfwgRBzJblBbxQcehtWEDPbr43I39LB4bJkIjTOe"> John says that Diotrephes loved to be first among those in the church and did not receive the apostle. This means that Diotrephes did not receive him hospitably. <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="YZd3qYEC_Jda-QZIySyXhCTytVfPTDCLDOMiHe6ZqJcT3kW7rxFLTl4OULbtbcSz8"> Diotrephes’ loving to be first was against the words of the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104896" data-verses="Matthew 20:25-27">Matthew 20:25-27</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104897" data-verses="Matthew 23:8-11">23:8-11</span>, which places all His believers on the same level, that of brothers. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104898" data-verses="2John 1:9">2 John 9</span> the Cerinthian Gnostics took the lead to advance in doctrine beyond the teaching concerning Christ. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104899" data-verses="3John 1:9">3 John 9</span> is one who was under the influence of Gnostic heretical doctrine, loving to be the first in the church. The problem of Gnostic doctrine was one of intellectual arrogance; the problem of loving to be first was one of self-exaltation in action. These two evils are sharp weapons used by God’s enemy, Satan, to execute his evil plot against God’s economy. One damages the believers’ faith in the divine reality: the other frustrates their work in God’s move. </p>
<p data-content-id="ETIQog5561IA9PRhma4Ub40bwJEAt8oe_-yF8XNEBd2-HrS2HD9nuGa0rCIJ8rB6v"> The principle was the same both with the Cerinthian Gnostics in their desire to be advanced in doctrine and with Diotrephes’ love to be first; they wanted to be above others. The Cerinthians wanted to be above others in advanced thought, and Diotrephes wanted to be first. Today’s modernists can be compared to the Cerinthians in their desire to have a higher, more advanced, philosophy. The modernists may think that the general belief among Christians is too low. Therefore, they desire to be above others in thought or philosophy. The desire to be above others and the desire to be first are both instances of pride and arrogance, and both were issues of heresy. </p>
<p data-content-id="DJsJSjP9E7w27wLN-rPwA5k-hYx-m_68PU_QqfxJlv23hCj3zE4COb9s8-R9WPqGu"> Among Christians today these two problems still exist. The first problem, the desire to be above others in thought, is related to doctrine. The second problem, the love of being first, is related to practice. In doctrine many desire to be advanced, to go beyond others. In practice, many love to be first. Such a love leads even to the desire to be a “pope.” Sometimes this evil principle creeps into the church life. For example, in standing up to give a testimony we may want to say something advanced, something that goes beyond what others can say. Furthermore, in the church life we may also desire to be first. Even in a small service group, we may want to be the first, the head. This is in principle the evil spirit of Diotrephes. <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="SG5rVpRB9L_86aJ4KHQluNY1nMnVvWMLWZkLvpY6U4JdZ1Fvo4PzW1jpNL00PiZq2"> Diotrephes was influenced by the Gnostics, and he advocated, promoted, Gnosticism. In this we see the subtlety of the enemy in trying to annul the enjoyment of the Triune God. Satan in his subtlety seeks either to distract us from the enjoyment of the Triune God, to cut us off from this enjoyment, or even to destroy it altogether. Consider the situation among believers today with respect to the enjoyment of the Triune God. Even the teaching of the Bible is utilized by the enemy to keep believers away from the proper enjoyment of the Triune God. Concerning this matter, a battle is raging, and we are fighting for the truth. We are not fighting for doctrine; we are fighting for the reality, which is the enjoyment of the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="gNpR3JO60MwrHJTmW5pVYkMNu7y73kuR5MAVZFXJwxImpD6Vv21JiwIy75XPLO5c5"> As we go on to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104900" data-verses="3John 1:10">3 John 10</span>, we see how domineering the evil Diotrephes was: “Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, babbling against us with evil words; and not being satisfied with these, neither does he receive the brothers, and those intending to do so he forbids and casts them out of the church.” The Greek word translated “babbling,” <em>phluareo,</em> comes from <em>phluo,</em> to boil over, to bubble up, to overflow with words, to talk idly; hence, to babble, to talk folly or nonsense. </p>
<p data-content-id="esgubDx2B1w7AiYP5fFVPXgof9twEVbPQ837BWWJLNaWuL8dG7IMlQ5x-XZ6YdOBz"> The babbling of Diotrephes was with “evil words.” The Greek word for “evil” here is <em>poneros,</em> which denotes something pernicious. <em>Poneros</em> differs from <em>kakos</em> which refers to an essentially worthless and wicked character; it differs as well from <em>sapros,</em> which indicates worthlessness and corruption, degeneracy from original virtue. The word <em>poneros</em> denotes something pernicious, harmfully evil, that affects and influences others to be evil and vicious. </p>
<p data-content-id="5B3xAq7zHk-EUm-J4YX2fJCZUGIBptmRhP7MQcebQ6efTl3vtVVkr45QP005JZnJY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104901" data-verses="3John 1:11">verse 11</span> John goes on to say, “Beloved, do not imitate the evil, but the good. He who does good is of God; he who does evil has not seen God.” Here the Greek word rendered “evil” is <em>kakos,</em> worthless, wicked, depraved. “Does good” comes from the Greek <em>agathopoieo</em> (of the root <em>agathos,</em> good), to be a well-doer (as a favor or a duty), practicing good; hence, to do good. <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="NX8g6D1MmBQW0mmerkdsDqQkmbEkES4YB52dgW7LP6xHXZ5pNDJ2AClY5uiM_WapS"> In this verse John says that he who does good is “of God.” Literally, the Greek word for “of” means out of, out from. Because we have been begotten of God, we are out from Him, possessing His life and partaking of His nature. God is the source of good. A well-doer, a doer of good, is one who has his source in God; that is, he is one who is out from God. </p>

The Greek word rendered “does evil” is <em>kako-poieo</em> (of the root <em>kakos,</em> worthless), to be an evildoer, practicing evil; hence, to do evil. An evildoer not only is not out of God, but has not even seen God. This means that he has not enjoyed God or experienced Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="hFfLPF_HO7H9jcXVhDo5Dt2newV-AGjZFt9sQp-7k4M0Z4PgExTeoeY6LBbN2XLgq"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104903" data-verses="3John 1:11">verse 11</span> to see God actually means to enjoy God and experience Him. We cannot see God without enjoying Him, and we cannot know God without experiencing Him. Seeing and knowing God are a matter of enjoying and experiencing Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="U_Zw0QhRb8zAZIdmgKlJm3uqUW87l8lu4UDWQg9c2cDAoLIQ85g9n0ZDLcUVIx53z"> Recently I have been encouraged by many of the testimonies given by young saints in the meetings. These testimonies indicate that these young saints are enjoying God and experiencing Him. This also indicates that they have seen God and have known Him. Without seeing and knowing God, without enjoying and experiencing Him, they could not give such testimonies. Our testimonies indicate whether or not we are enjoying and experiencing God. As we have pointed out, our enjoyment of God is our seeing of Him, and our experience of God is our knowing of Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MKlgQB-WzU_QT-qKDpqQgHC3IdfdrRBzJblBbxQcehtWEDPbr43I39LB4bJkIjTOe">THE WELL-REPORTED DEMETRIUS—<br/>A GOOD EXAMPLE</h2><p data-content-id="V1T9qS95uzrUEdCWOJIW61BaN4fy9Og3c9XwineZNSXBVqx2uYa_kW-kTo6Ru2MtA"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104904" data-verses="3John 1:12">verse 12</span> John goes on to say, “To Demetrius testimony has been borne by all, and by the truth itself; and we also testify, and you know that our testimony is true.” Demetrius, who may have been one of the traveling brothers working for the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104905" data-verses="3John 1:5-8">vv. 5-8</span>), may have been also the bearer of this Epistle to Gaius. Hence, a favorable and strong commendation of him by the writer was needed. <span class="pg" data-page-id="15" id="15">[15]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="iPJJ1umlkg6aEgGR4rKzf85wYMvCKVfKL-LjOavZ1BkTq18uXF0fyTLC7FOs8QFEe"> John says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104906" data-verses="3John 1:12">verse 12</span> that to Demetrius testimony has been borne by all. The word “all” indicates many saints in different churches. John’s word indicates that Demetrius must have been a brother working among the churches, and thus was well known. </p>
<p data-content-id="1rfe5nMg6NGgHU754v_Ksus6OCHIaOVB3B1sroooyezolK7uEtX8K9ir_wvRW0V8j"> John also says that testimony has been borne to Demetrius “by the truth itself.” This is the revealed truth of God, as the reality of the essence of the Christian faith, which is the divine rule for the walk of all believers and by which the believers’ walk is determined. Thus, it gives a good testimony to him who walks in it, as it did to Demetrius. </p>
