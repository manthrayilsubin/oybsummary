<h1 class="title" data-content-id="J-GpZUZ4kVBIvd5R8J1AINvaogkqSRQAjWB7RQPvz7P22_9iz4SIUft-9nE0gzGry">A FOREWORD</h1><p data-content-id="zZdlZsx_Xy-tGxScyNm6rM6fEkkfNxIMErtkQIYPSIs0hDew6MtdTE2PZ2QGnjo-X"> By the Lord’s mercy, in this life-study we come to the last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation. Due to the subtle enemy of God, the book of Revelation has been closed, and few Christians understand it. Hardly anyone has seen something of life, of God’s economy, and of the testimony of Jesus in this book. Thus, we have been burdened by the Lord to have a life-study of this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="aW2aGRh_13sA-UYZ1egivQxguBmNxmaxrWvBvRqb8eU43xPKWs7vx4JzgzkzVkyZK"> Revelation is a book of prophecy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105141" data-verses="Revelation 1:3">1:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105142" data-verses="Revelation 22:7">22:7</span>), for the revelation it contains is in the nature of prophecy. Most of the visions refer to things to come. Even the seven epistles to the seven churches in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105143" data-verses="Revelation 2:1">chapters two and three</span>, in the sense of signs, are prophecies regarding the church on earth until the Lord’s coming back. Although this book is a book of prophecy, it is not prophecy merely in words, but in visions revealed to the seer. In the eyes of God, all the things prophesied in this book have already transpired and all have been shown to the seer in vision after vision. </p>
<p data-content-id="by2v23Nedf13WGfghX9I29Vrsx1_rARCOuCyECvjxyFHKSsKwXMqeaZkYrTMh3eTi"> In the book of Revelation, most of the verbs and predicates are not in the future tense, but in the past tense, indicating that the events recorded in this book have already transpired. Strictly speaking, Revelation is not merely a prophecy; it is a revelation of things which have already taken place. While they may not seem in our eyes to have transpired, in God’s eyes they have transpired. In God’s eyes, everything recorded in this book occurred nearly two thousand years ago. We all must believe this. Most Christians consider Revelation to be a book of predictions and they are curious to understand these predictions. Many of them read this book only for the sake of their curiosity. But <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> we must say to the Lord, “O Lord, save us from this. We don’t want to know this book in the way of curiosity.” I say strongly, once again, that Revelation is not merely a book of prophecy, but a record of things which have already taken place. </p>
<p data-content-id="qFT3je7o6rEOFRguDp8CG0dTmoKY9eLv-CuesvcrtybeUNGaiOI26ePMHk72T6-ua"> In Revelation, two main things have transpired. The first is that the testimony of Jesus has been accomplished for eternity. Have you not seen the New Jerusalem? The apostle John saw it nearly two thousand years ago. Do you believe that you are in the New Jerusalem? If we appear to be crazy for saying this, we are crazy according to the Bible. The New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of God’s work through the centuries, has been completely built up, and we are in it! According to the last two chapters of Revelation, the building of the New Jerusalem has been accomplished. This first item is on the positive side. </p>
<p data-content-id="yIistfmiI2_aDzgmmvCwMJLHGtYHeoDpV_WNoVoXfyhbv9uKSdjFfOREsc87szYIq"> On the negative side, a second main thing has transpired—Satan, the enemy of God, has been dealt with. In the eyes of God and even in the eyes of our brother John, Satan has been cast into the lake of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105144" data-verses="Revelation 20:10">20:10</span>). Satan, the serpent, is in the lake of fire, and we are in the New Jerusalem. Have you seen this? If we have seen that Satan is in the lake of fire, we shall not beg God to deal with him. Rather, we shall praise Him that the enemy has been dealt with. Whenever Satan troubles us, we must tell him, “Satan, you are in the wrong place. You should not be here. You belong in the lake of fire. Go back there and do not come here again.” Have you ever done this? We all must do it. </p>
<p data-content-id="8xVo-B7NrMY0kPDgZqBD43ILJq7-ZvWwuq3Joqe2LOC9AD1rboXiIgCBQAwKW-c3U"> The Bible is always consistent, even in the matter of Satan, God’s enemy. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105145" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>, Satan came to humanity in a very subtle way, coming in the form of a serpent. In Revelation, Satan is deliberately called “the old serpent” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105146" data-verses="Revelation 12:9">12:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105147" data-verses="Revelation 20:2">20:2</span>). In the book of Genesis, the serpent was not so old, but in the book of Revelation, he has become old, at least six thousand years old. With a definite intention, the book of Revelation purposely calls him “the old serpent.” At the time of the book of Revelation, however, Satan is not only “the old <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> serpent”; he has also become a dragon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105148" data-verses="Revelation 12:9">12:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105149" data-verses="Revelation 20:2">20:2</span>). According to Revelation, this dragon is firstly cast out of heaven and down to the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105150" data-verses="Revelation 12:7-9">12:7-9</span>). Then, after three and one-half years, he is bound and cast into the abyss (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105151" data-verses="Revelation 20:1-3">20:1-3</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105152" data-verses="Revelation 20:1">Revelation 20</span> we see that, still being somewhat useful in the hands of God, the Lord will release Satan from the abyss at the end of the thousand years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105153" data-verses="Revelation 20:7">20:7</span>). After his release, Satan will try his best to damage humanity, “to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to war” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105154" data-verses="Revelation 20:8">20:8</span>). But, shortly afterward, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105155" data-verses="Revelation 20:10">20:10</span>, the Devil will be cast into the lake of fire, which is his destiny and destination. The book of Revelation has been closed because it exposes Satan, disclosing his destiny and destination. But now, at the end of time, we believe that the Lord will open up this book and open up our hearts, spirits, and eyes that we may clearly see that God’s enemy is now in the lake of fire. Hallelujah, Satan, the old serpent, is in the lake of fire and we are in the New Jerusalem! </p>
<p data-content-id="ADcOpTWyGt901MiqV_ZKRV6F7PjPB-zaZ6KLGZIyWdC9Glu88RqQYZsBIACfYqBFW"> The New Jerusalem is the testimony of Jesus. Today’s church is also the testimony of Jesus. Today, we in the churches are the testimony of Jesus. We all must see this to the uttermost, forgetting ourselves, our weaknesses, our besetting sins, and even the fact that we are on earth. When someone asks you where you are, you must reply, “I’m in the New Jerusalem.” In the New Jerusalem there are no bugs, frogs, scorpions, or serpents. Furthermore, in that city there is no sin, death, or world. There is nothing there except Christ and God’s redeemed and transformed people. If we see this, we shall praise the Lord and shout, “Hallelujah!” </p>
<p data-content-id="FrpbcRt3yRk0Uxjm1URW7Eg0_hWMicIpTrxPj1VjX3CdPg4WUZDe1ebWLRh8zhLuo"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105156" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1:1</span> says, “The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves what must swiftly take place; and He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave, John.” The revelation of this book is mainly composed of signs, that is, symbols with spiritual significance, such as the seven lampstands signifying the churches and the seven stars signifying the messengers of the churches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105157" data-verses="Revelation 1:20">1:20</span>). Even the New Jerusalem <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> is a sign, signifying the ultimate consummation of God’s economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105158" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">ch. 21—22</span>). This book, then, is a book of symbols through which the revelation is made known to us. John’s Gospel is a book of signs signifying how Christ came to be our life to produce the church, His Bride. John’s Revelation is also a book of signs showing how Christ is now caring for the church and how He is coming to judge and possess the earth and to bring the church, His Bride, into God’s full economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Cs3ONxeMth5mwllbyYf4lOgkNzl9uaDV8RSd8O8Hqv0o7uTpEdoOJ6dbZT0nyJr-e">I. A BOOK OF CONCLUSION</h2><p data-content-id="P8jMkwpkLdBOj0p4O-2xBwjyLW0fwn8fuCHBwhorQzQcIaMpTU1ljj4-xfrJokpi-"> Revelation is a book of conclusion. If the book of Revelation were deleted from the Bible, there would be a great shortage, for there would be a beginning but no ending. Although there is the beginning in the book of Genesis, without the book of Revelation there is no conclusion or consummation. After having a good start and after passing through so many works, there is the need for God to have a consummation. Without Revelation, there is no conclusion of God’s economy. God is great; He is a God of purpose. For the fulfillment of His purpose, His economy must be accomplished. Many Bible students have neglected the matter of God’s economy. If we did not have Revelation, we could not see the consummation of God’s economy. In fact, we would even find it difficult to realize what God’s economy is, because we would not see the result, the issue of His economy. But in this book the revelation of God’s economy is so clear because it contains the conclusion of God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="-m2NLiiFqCHFHE8nxPFGHsCUZvVPVsF0yGcvkTVWCVV_Epm3QfZFd6BUh2KJg6mtY"> Without Revelation, we would also have no conclusion to the redemption of Christ. Christ came in the flesh and died on the cross to accomplish redemption. But what does redemption accomplish? To say that Christ’s redemption only saves sinners and brings them to heaven is a very poor conclusion. This kind of conclusion is not so meaningful. But in Revelation we see that Christ redeemed us, purchasing us with His blood, to make us a kingdom and priests. Hence, this book discloses the conclusion of Christ’s redemption. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="BM6WPQDgbT__QB93oHAQLnlaf_E1uj3XBIVTiOGoM8gwQ4MS1D6UUKO84G9MHWJh_">THE REVELATION OF CHRIST<br/>UNIQUE AND ULTIMATE</h1><p data-content-id="xsF1VTQ6uNmvQ0gsEZfYs9IbLQYTBSFzV_mWIqnjliKoXml2ZS6zTzBkq4NzheEv5"> In this message we come to the revelation of Christ. In their reading of the book of Revelation not many Christians have paid their full attention to the revelation of Christ contained in it. This term, <em>the revelation of Jesus Christ,</em> is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105236" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">1:1</span>, and Bible students have held different opinions of its interpretation. Some say that this term means that the book of Revelation is a book given by Christ as a revelation. This interpretation, which makes the revelation of Christ very objective, is not accurate. If we read the whole book of Revelation, we shall see that this term indicates that Revelation is the unveiling of Christ Himself. It is a picture, a depiction, of Christ, not merely a revelation given by Christ. We must see that Christ is the center, the focus, and the predominant figure of the whole book of Revelation. Thus, we must take the term <em>the revelation of Jesus Christ</em> in a subjective way. It is not merely a revelation given by Christ, but a revelation which unveils Christ to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="rFrCGjzy0s3seaoP5ZFz1WE5cA8BC8Jn7QPczLYQpR6KGf-mSZlvxLAT6G-4WlYEl"> Christ is revealed in the prophecies, types, and clear words of the Old Testament. In a sense, we do not need the New Testament, for if we read the Old Testament, paying close attention to the prophecies, types, and clear words regarding Christ, we shall have a revelation of Christ. Through these revelations, we can visualize what kind of Christ is Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, however perfect are the revelations of Christ in the Old Testament, they are not complete. Hence, we must come to the New Testament which fully is a revelation of Christ. If we merely read the Gospels, <span class="pg" data-page-id="16" id="16">[16]</span> the Acts, and the Epistles, we shall see many aspects of Christ, but we shall not see the aspects covered in the book of Revelation. In this message we must see the unique and particular aspects of Christ’s revelation contained in this book. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dqTRyG6GA884EmjvR4UyOegfNIBGTZtc9pTPOwHALeZwBCUtG7wCY77G5UKUOOnaQ">I. CHRIST IN HIS ASCENSION</h2><p data-content-id="QpDUAnrDI_WRFtrr3f3Kzh9t8afECCS3lhyUHZa2seNBxZHOZbMQUNSElYwe-H2bi"> In the book of Revelation, Christ is revealed as the ascended One (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105237" data-verses="Revelation 5:3-6">5:3-6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105238" data-verses="Revelation 5:8-14">8-14</span>). In the four Gospels we see Christ incarnated, living on earth, crucified, and resurrected. However, we do not see very much concerning Christ in His ascension. Even in the Epistles we see little of Christ’s ascension. Although the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles say something regarding Christ’s ascension, in none of these books do we find a clear picture of the scene or state in the heavens after Christ’s ascension. If we would see this picture, we must come to the book of Revelation where we have a portrait of Christ in the heavens after His ascension. In this book we have a full and clear picture of the very Christ who has ascended into the heavens. Furthermore, in this picture we see the scene, the sight, the state in the heavens after Christ’s ascension. Only when we see this revelation will we worship Him in an adequate way. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="KieXqJ7jgoER4UdfBfZNeFTK0jn-ldhh6wo2bjONxSaxFCktk5VChNS7qxKtiNlUj">A. The Lion-Lamb</h2><p data-content-id="lNulM8LrKW8XhGNjyhb8z8_RABxcnWRrAM_UAfWfx_DwAjiko112RRWMunPS7zWYR"> In His ascension, Christ is the Lion-Lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105239" data-verses="Revelation 5:5-6">5:5-6</span>). In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist declared, “Behold, the Lamb of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105240" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>). But in the scene in the heavens after Christ’s ascension, Christ is revealed mainly as the Lion, not as the Lamb. While John was weeping because “no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105241" data-verses="Revelation 5:4">Rev. 5:4</span>), one of the elders said to him, “Do not weep; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105242" data-verses="Revelation 5:5">5:5</span>). Before the crucifixion, there might have been reason for John to weep. But it was foolish for him to weep after the ascension. Are you weeping today? If you are still weeping, it means that you have not seen the vision of the ascended Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="17" id="17">[17]</span> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105243" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">Revelation 5</span>. You need to behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105244" data-verses="Genesis 49:8-9">Genesis 49:8 and 9</span> prophesy concerning Christ as the Lion of Judah, and only in Revelation are we told that Christ is the Lion of the tribe of Judah. The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome and is worthy to open the seals of God’s economy. After John heard this declaration from one of the elders, he saw “in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105245" data-verses="Revelation 5:6">5:6</span>). He saw the Lion as the Lamb. Is Christ the Lion or the Lamb? He is both. Hence, we may call Him the Lion-Lamb. </p>
<p data-content-id="GYIVpUWkuZmHSrN-tf6YUfoxq7P6wp2-OL81T49tkhetZaHINSoSt6T3Ue9-usg-C"> Why is Christ both the Lion and the Lamb? Because we have two main problems—sin and Satan. Most Christians only take care of the sin problem and forget the Satan problem. Do not think that your husband is so difficult. Do not blame him, but blame Satan who is behind him. Likewise, every wife is good. The bad things which come out of our wives do not actually issue from them but from Satan who is behind them. The Lamb is versus sin and solves the problem of sin, and the Lion deals with Satan. As the Lamb, Christ has accomplished redemption, having washed us from our sins. As the Lion, He has dealt with Satan. He is adequate to meet our needs and to solve our problems. Now sin is over, Satan has been terminated, and we have been redeemed and rescued from the usurping hand of the enemy. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="cgfMaJYFAO1mOpI22kRdhJ3Kaa1LUUAHK7fr4_AyvD4ITdSSCh7v-cnqPDc7CCaPG">B. The Worthy One</h2><p data-content-id="Yf-rmGLmzs8DVJKAZqsHcn6KmA6m3MQpwCL8YYxWWYsYffHyYsR_Jf62ch9moi03S"> Our Savior is the Lamb as well as the Lion. We have a Lion-Lamb Savior. This One is worthy to open the scroll. Apart from Him, no one in the universe is worthy to open the secret, the mystery, of God’s economy. But the Lion-Lamb is worthy because He has accomplished redemption and has won the victory over Satan. Whenever we Christians have said that Christ was worthy, our thought was that He was worthy of our praises and thanks and worship. When we said, “Lord Jesus, You are worthy,” not many of us realized that He was worthy to open the seals of the secret of God’s economy. We only had the concept that Christ was worthy <span class="pg" data-page-id="18" id="18">[18]</span> to receive worship, praise, and thanks from us, His little creatures. But this is an inadequate concept of the Lord’s worthiness. Yet most hymns on the worthiness of Christ express this inadequate concept of His worthiness. Not many hymns praise Christ for being worthy to open the secret of God’s economy. This aspect of the Lord’s worthiness is universal and immeasurable. Of course, Christ is worthy of our praises. He is even worthy of our lives. Nevertheless, we must realize that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105246" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">Revelation 5</span>, Christ’s worthiness is a matter of His being worthy to open the secret of God’s economy. The universe is a mystery which the scientists cannot unravel. They simply do not know the meaning or the purpose of the universe, because it is a secret kept from them. But Christ is worthy to open this secret for He is worthy to open the seals of God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="EquHWEovemLQ65DjOF9kgzpp6sCOE2OsiQtpIkUhAc0HmLnNxgDapPV_nZlY4Z7aR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105247" data-verses="Revelation 5:5">Revelation 5:5</span> says that the Lion is worthy to open the scroll and its seven seals. A scroll is a roll of parchment paper or other material. Because a scroll is rolled up, it is difficult to determine just how long it is. The scroll in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105248" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">Revelation 5</span> is eternally long. Only Christ is worthy to open this eternally-long scroll. Do not think that you have seen everything contained in this scroll. No, we shall need eternity to see all that is included in it. When we are in the New Jerusalem, we shall still be reading the contents of the scroll. For eternity we shall say, “Now I see something more.” God will give us an eternal surprise. The surprise of the opening of the scroll will last for eternity. When you are in eternity, you may say, “The Lord’s surprise is eternal. Although we are now in eternity, we still cannot see the end.” Christ is worthy to open this scroll of God’s mystery. </p>

The angels are represented by the twenty-four elders, and all the other creatures are represented by the four living creatures. The angels have elders, the twenty-four angelic <span class="pg" data-page-id="19" id="19">[19]</span> elders who take the lead to worship Christ. Here in this picture we see the twenty-four elders praising and all the angels praising, the four living creatures praising and all the other creatures praising. Together they render universal worship to God and the Lamb. The Christ in whom we believe is such a universal Christ. </p>

In other words, this book is concerned with Christ and the church. In Revelation, Christ and the church are revealed in a unique and particular way. In the last message we pointed out that many aspects of Christ which are not found in other books in the Bible are unveiled in Revelation. The same is true with the church. The book of Revelation unfolds the church in a very particular way. In this message we shall present a summary of the aspects of the church found in Revelation, while in later messages we shall cover the details. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="cgfMaJYFAO1mOpI22kRdhJ3KaalLQGwHK7fr4_AyvD4ITdSSCh7v-cnqPDc7CCaPG">I. THE LAMPSTANDS</h2><p data-content-id="Yf-rmGLmzs8DVJKAZqsHcn6KmAqmweQpwCL8YYxWWYsYffHyYsR_Jf62ch9moi03S"> Firstly, in Revelation the churches are unveiled as being the lampstands (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105297" data-verses="Revelation 1:11-20">1:11-20</span>). In no other New Testament book is this term used with respect to the church. In other books we are told that the church is the gathering of God’s chosen ones, that it is the Body of Christ, and that it is the house of God. But apart from Revelation, we are not told that the church is the lampstand. As the lampstands, the churches shine in the darkness. The word <em>lampstand</em> enables us to understand much about the church and its function. The church is not the lamp; it is the lampstand, the stand which holds the lamp. Without the lamp, the lampstand is vain and means nothing. But the lampstand holds the shining lamp. As we saw in the preceding message, God is the light and the Lamb is the lamp (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105298" data-verses="Revelation 21:23">21:23</span>). Thus, Christ is the lamp, and the church is the lampstand holding the lamp. God is in <span class="pg" data-page-id="28" id="28">[28]</span> Christ and Christ as the lamp is held by the stand to shine out God’s glory. This is the testimony of the church. </p>

To say this is absolutely scriptural, for the book of Revelation says that the local churches are golden lampstands (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105299" data-verses="Revelation 1:20">1:20</span>). These stands are not built of clay, wood, or any inferior substance; they are constructed out of pure gold. This means that all the local churches must be divine. Without divinity, there can be no church. Although the church is composed of humanity with divinity, humanity should not be the basic nature of the local churches. The basic nature of the local churches must be divinity, God’s divine nature. By these two simple words—<em>golden lampstands</em>—we realize a great deal about the church: that the church is something shining with Christ and that it is constituted with the divine nature. </p>

If there were no darkness, there would be no need for the shining of the light of the lamp. The shining of the lamp is quite particular. In order for the lamp to shine, it must have oil burning within it. If the oil burns within the lamp, the light will shine out through all the darkness. This is the function of the church. The function of the church is not simply to preach or to teach doctrine. In the dark night of this age, the church must shine out the very glory of God. This is the testimony of the church. </p>

Many Christians, having taken in a mistaken concept, desire to be different from other Christians. When I came to this <span class="pg" data-page-id="29" id="29">[29]</span> country fourteen years ago, I met some dear Christians who were troubled because the local churches were all the same. They told me that they would try their best to be different. This is not right. Everyone has a head, two shoulders, two arms, two hands, and ten fingers, and every human head has seven holes: two ears, two eyes, two nostrils, and a mouth. It is ridiculous to say, “I don’t want to have the same appearance as others. In order to be different, I would like to have five holes in my head.” How ridiculous this is! Those who claim that every local church should be unique base their concept upon the differences among the seven churches in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105300" data-verses="Revelation 2:1-2">Revelation 2 and 3</span>. Some have said, “Look! All the seven churches are different.” In the early years, when I was very young, I was influenced by this concept and I taught the same thing. But one day the light dawned upon me and I saw that all the differences in the local churches in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105301" data-verses="Revelation 2:1-2">Revelation 2 and 3</span> are negative, not positive. Ephesus lost her first love—negative; Pergamos is worldly—negative; Thyatira is demonic—negative; and Laodicea became lukewarm—negative. On the positive side, however, all the local churches are identical, because they all are seven golden lampstands. If you could place all the seven lampstands on a table before you, unless you numbered or labeled them, you would be unable to tell them apart. All the seven lampstands are the same. </p>
<p data-content-id="ITBVDgsapCA5h0Ba51FA5D5vk46u_xKmvrF7YxN5-1GluETQyeBTiS_tmIqIxEe99"> Nevertheless, since 1962, some voices in this country have declared loudly that they will never be like the church in Los Angeles. Where are those voices today? They have faded away, and all the peculiar concepts they advocated have failed. I am not saying that all must follow the church in Los Angeles. But if Los Angeles has seven “holes,” then it would be ridiculous for others to insist upon having five “holes.” On the positive side, all the local churches must be identical. On the negative side, however, they are different. If the church in Los Angeles would worship idols, then we must refuse to follow them. In matters such as this, we must be different. But it is wrong to say that, on the positive side, the local churches should not be the same. We should not <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> try to make ourselves peculiar or different—this is pride. One day the Lord showed me that the four sides of the New Jerusalem are exactly the same. Each side of the wall is built with the same material—jasper. It is not that one side is built with jasper and the other sides with brass. No, all four sides are the same. Likewise, universally, all the churches must be the same. They need not be the same in organization, but they must be identical in appearance. For example, the churches in New Zealand should be the same as the churches in Japan. Because we all are one church, all the churches on earth should be universally the same. Locally, we are the churches; universally, we are the church. This is the testimony of Jesus. </p>

According to the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105303" data-verses="Revelation 7:1">chapter seven</span>, this great multitude is the whole Body of God’s redeemed ones, having been redeemed “out of every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105304" data-verses="Revelation 7:9">7:9</span>). All of them have passed through tribulation. This indicates that at no time nor at any place is there a church which has not passed through tribulation. The world always persecutes the churches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105305" data-verses="John 16:33">John 16:33</span>). Wherever the church is, there will always be a certain amount of persecution. That the whole Body of the redeemed ones will pass through tribulation is indicated by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105306" data-verses="Revelation 7:14">7:14</span>, which says, “These are those who come out of the great tribulation.” This great multitude has come out of tribulation in a victorious way, for they all hold palm branches which signify their victory over tribulation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105307" data-verses="Revelation 7:9">7:9</span>). Eventually, in eternity, they will be overshadowed by God with His tabernacle. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105308" data-verses="Revelation 7:15">7:15</span> says, “He who sits upon the throne shall spread His tabernacle over them.” This is the destiny of God’s redeemed ones.

In eternity, their state will be that of enjoying God’s overshadowing and Christ’s shepherding. This is our destiny. This portion of the Word reveals that while Christ is executing God’s judgment upon mankind, He will take care of God’s redeemed ones. All God’s redeemed ones eventually will be raptured to the throne of God and will stand there enjoying God’s overshadowing and the Lamb’s shepherding. </p>

In the book of Revelation we have the ultimate and complete revelation of who God is. God is triune. We all are familiar with the term <em>the Triune God.</em> This is a great matter in God’s revelation. Throughout the centuries, however, most Christians have not fully realized the meaning of the term <em>the Triune God.</em> In the book of Revelation, the book which reveals things in an ultimate way, we see something deeper, higher, richer, and sweeter concerning the Triune God. We have seen that in Revelation, the revelation of Christ and the testimony of Jesus are ultimate. In this message, we need to see that here the revelation of the Triune God is also ultimate. </p>

Jesus Christ, who is to God “the faithful Witness,” to the church “the Firstborn of the dead,” and to the world “the Ruler of the kings of the earth,” is God the Son. This is the Triune God. As God the eternal Father, He was in the past, He is in the present, and He is coming in the future. As God the Spirit, He is the sevenfold, intensified Spirit for God’s operation. As God the Son, He is “the Witness,” the testimony, the expression of God; “the Firstborn of the dead” for the church, the new creation; and “the Ruler of the kings of the earth” for the world. From such <span class="pg" data-page-id="38" id="38">[38]</span> a Triune God, grace and peace are imparted into the churches. </p>

In the Hebrew language, the title God means the mighty One, the One who is powerful. But in Revelation we see that God is not only mighty, but Almighty. He is powerful in every way, in every aspect, in everything, and with everyone. God’s title means that He is the Almighty One. </p>

We may say that He is the landlord of the whole universe. He is the Ruler, the authority, in this universe. What we or others say means nothing. But what God says means everything because He is the Lord. When He says, “Yes,” it means yes, and when He says, “No,” it means no. God is not only the Lord, the owner, and the authority; He is also the Master. The whole universe, including the angels and all human beings, is under Him. We have a Master who possesses us. Before I was saved, I did not know to whom I belonged. But now I can shout, “God is my Master, the One who possesses me. Hallelujah, He is my Lord!” </p>

His title, I Am, not only indicates that He exists but that, in a positive sense, He is everything. He is life, light, and every other positive thing. Do you need life? God is life. Do you want light? God is light. Do you desire holiness? God is holiness. God exists from eternity to eternity and He is everything. This is our God. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105345" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> the sequence of the Triune God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105346" data-verses="Revelation 1:4-5">1:4 and 5</span> the sequence is changed. The seven Spirits of God are listed in the second place instead of the third. This reveals the importance of the intensified function of the sevenfold Spirit of God. This point is confirmed by the repeated emphasis on the Spirit’s speaking in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105347" data-verses="Revelation 2:7">2:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105348" data-verses="Revelation 2:11">11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105349" data-verses="Revelation 2:17">17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105350" data-verses="Revelation 2:29">29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105351" data-verses="Revelation 3:6">3:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105352" data-verses="Revelation 3:13">13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105353" data-verses="Revelation 3:22">22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105354" data-verses="Revelation 14:13">14:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105355" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">22:17</span>.

It is because in this book the age has been changed from the Son to the Spirit. In the book of Revelation, the age is the age of the Spirit, and in this age the Spirit has been intensified. </p>
<p data-content-id="Te69zzil3D0-mAl8PfN896MAGQuo-K6xc7b0VET_-Yefo8dz0ktoThHUcteAt6Rr5"> Because the Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105356" data-verses="Revelation 1:4">1:4</span> is the intensified Spirit of God, He is called the seven Spirits. The seven Spirits are undoubtedly the Spirit of God because they are ranked among the Triune God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105357" data-verses="Revelation 1:4-5">verses 4 and 5</span>. We cannot understand the Bible according to our natural, limited mentality. According to our concept, the words <em>seven Spirits</em> denote seven individual spirits. But this is not the meaning. The number seven here does not refer to seven different spirits but to one sevenfold Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="nvHEdQi38H-SlLL6P9OfVCFAumR22xHv2jZt6ZG6aLbP35LOw849ym4uqoStVA0ft"> Seven is the number of completion in God’s dispensational move, while twelve is the number of completion in God’s eternal administration. For example, God created the earth in six days plus one Sabbath day. Furthermore, there are seven dispensations in the Bible. For God’s move today, the church has the number seven. In the book of Revelation the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls are all for God’s dispensational move. Thus, the sevenfold Spirit is the intensified Spirit in God’s move today. He is the seven Spirits of God for God’s move. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="Te69zzil3D0-mAl8PfN896MAGQ-o_YKxc7b0VET_-Yefo8dz0ktoThHUcteAt6Rr5">THE COMING AGAIN OF CHRIST</h1><p data-content-id="nvHEdQi38H-SlLL6P9OfVCFAumB2wjHv2jZt6ZG6aLbP35LOw849ym4uqoStVA0ft"> Most Christians hold the concept that the book of Revelation is a book of Christ’s second coming. It is absolutely correct to hold this concept because Revelation does cover the second coming of Christ. However, throughout the years, Christians have not been clear about the Lord’s second coming. Due to this lack of clarity, there has been much disputing and wrangling about it. The revelation regarding Christ’s second coming is not simple; rather, it is quite complicated and has several aspects. Therefore, it has been difficult for most Christians to understand thoroughly the Lord’s coming again. </p>
<p data-content-id="6gUudY5_FgkP0IWCRfIYS9bkpiAOoC5MuZnMLKGfCY9m8DxWQTymsdYcJHe9YM_1B"> During the past century and a half, many books have been written, especially by the Brethren, about the second coming of Christ. Some of the leading teachers among the Brethren held different opinions about the Lord’s coming back, and the first division between them was the result of these different opinions. The so-called Brethren testimony was raised up in 1828 or 29 under the leadership of John Nelson Darby. Darby taught that Christ would come back before the great tribulation, while Benjamin Newton, another leading teacher, said that Christ would come back after the tribulation. Because these two great teachers held different opinions, there were many debates about this matter. Eventually, this brought about the first division among the so-called Brethren between those under the leadership of Darby and those under the leadership of Newton. I was associated with the Benjamin Newton group for seven and a half years during which time I learned all their teachings. They certainly had a strong ground for saying that the second coming of Christ would be after the great tribulation. If you <span class="pg" data-page-id="52" id="52">[52]</span> read the best writings of all the great teachers during the past one hundred fifty years, you will find that some taught that Christ’s coming would be before the tribulation and others taught that it would follow the tribulation. </p>
<p data-content-id="RcLtLXvO2x49e5HSqeDCRKXOyVMf32QDyI7Yq7O3GLi69XubFEtTV_iN6b9MI_Z-a"> During the past century, the Lord raised up some careful students of the Word, such as G. H. Pember, Robert Govett, and D. M. Panton. These men discovered that Christ’s second coming is not a simple matter. They saw that, on the one hand, Christ will come back after the tribulation, but that, on the other hand, He will also come back before the tribulation. These careful students of the Bible have supplied strong proof to substantiate the correctness of this view. Christ’s coming back has at least two aspects—one before the tribulation and the other after the tribulation. Furthermore, these students of the Word also learned that the rapture of the saints will be of more than two categories. This means that some saints will be raptured before the tribulation and others after the tribulation. Do not react to such statements too hastily. I reacted that way when I was young, but eventually I was subdued and convinced. The Bible is not as simple as some think it is. </p>
<p data-content-id="sgITvoUbLp9kr7so-lifik0UHiic53maWiA8xIiSnO6y-U0RpWzmI90zjb8ycRLz9"> In this message, we shall consider the subject of Christ’s coming again. We thank God for all the teachers of the Word who have gone before us. We are grateful to them, and whatever we see, we see as those who are standing upon their shoulders. If we would understand the second coming of Christ, we must study the Bible and also read the books written by these great teachers. Then we shall be able to have a comprehensive view of the matter. If we do this, we shall be fully convinced that Christ’s coming has two aspects: the secret, private aspect and the open, public aspect. </p>

<p data-content-id="zZdlZsx_Xy-tGxScyNm6rM6fElkfIjoMErtkQIYPSIs0hDew6MtdTE2PZ2QGnjo-X"> In both Matthew and Revelation we see the secret aspect of Christ’s coming again. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105405" data-verses="Revelation 3:3">Revelation 3:3</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105406" data-verses="Revelation 16:15">16:15</span> both tell us that Christ will come as a thief and that we should be <span class="pg" data-page-id="53" id="53">[53]</span> watchful. No thief comes openly or announces his coming. As we pointed out in a previous message, when the Lord comes as a thief, He will come to steal the precious things. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105407" data-verses="Matthew 24:40-41">Matthew 24:40 and 41</span>, the Lord spoke of His secret coming, saying, “Then shall two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left. Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left.” The Lord Jesus was very wise, using two brothers in the field and two sisters grinding at the mill as illustrations. Apparently the two brothers are the same and the two sisters are the same. But suddenly one of the brothers and one of the sisters are taken. After giving this illustration, the Lord said, “Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes. But know this, that if the householder knew in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore, you also, be ready, for the Son of Man comes in an hour that you think not” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105408" data-verses="Matthew 24:42-44">vv. 42-44</span>). As we are working, having no consciousness that Christ is coming, some of us will be raptured. Since He is coming as a thief, we must be watchful. </p>

The Time—Unknown</h2><p data-content-id="by2v23Nedf13WGfghX9I29Vrsw1_sSRCOuCyECvjxyFHKSsKwXMqeaZkYrTMh3eTi"> The time of the Lord’s secret coming is unknown (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105409" data-verses="Revelation 3:3">3:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105410" data-verses="Matthew 24:36">Matt. 24:36</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105411" data-verses="Matthew 24:42">42</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105412" data-verses="Matthew 25:13">25:13</span>). When Christ comes again, He will come as a Sent One. Because of this, in Revelation He is called the Angel, One who is sent by God. In His second coming, as in His first, Christ will come as One who has been sent by God. This is the reason that only the Father knows the time of Christ’s secret coming (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105413" data-verses="Matthew 24:36">Matt. 24:36</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105414" data-verses="Mark 13:32">Mark 13:32</span>). The Father is the Sender and the Son is the Sent One. Only the Sender, not even the Sent One, knows the time. </p>
<p data-content-id="qFT3je7o6rEOFRguDp8CG0dTmpKY7Mbv-CuesvcrtybeUNGaiOI26ePMHk72T6-ua"> Some people, seeming to know more than the Lord Jesus, have predicted the time of the Lord’s coming. During the past century and a half, there have been many predictions, none of which has been fulfilled. Some predicted that the Lord Jesus would come on a certain date and charged people to prepare themselves by taking a bath and by putting on <span class="pg" data-page-id="54" id="54">[54]</span> clean, white clothing. Others have climbed to a mountaintop to await the Lord’s coming back. After World War I, many teachers published books about prophecy, especially concerning the Lord’s coming back. Some of these writers also predicted the time of the Lord’s coming. All these predictions about the time of the Lord’s coming have been proved false. Be careful not to predict anything. According to the Bible, the time of the Lord’s secret coming is unknown. </p>

The Place—in the Cloud to the Air</h2><p data-content-id="8xVo-B7NrMY0kPDgZqBD43ILJr7-R8mwuq3Joqe2LOC9AD1rboXiIgCBQAwKW-c3U"> The place of the Lord’s secret coming will be in the cloud to the air (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105415" data-verses="Revelation 10:1">10:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105416" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:17">1 Thes. 4:17</span>). The cloud is related to the Lord’s coming back. Christ went to heaven on a cloud, and He will come back to earth in the same way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105417" data-verses="Acts 1:9">Acts 1:9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105418" data-verses="Acts 1:11">11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105419" data-verses="Matthew 26:64">Matt. 26:64</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105420" data-verses="Revelation 14:14">Rev. 14:14</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105421" data-verses="Matthew 26:64">Matthew 26:64</span>, the Lord Jesus said to the high priest, “Henceforth you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.” Even with the Lord’s coming in the cloud there are two aspects. Firstly, the Lord will come in the cloud. This means that He will be concealed by the cloud. Secondly, He will come upon the cloud. When He comes in the cloud, He will not come to the earth but to the air. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105422" data-verses="Revelation 10:1">Revelation 10:1</span> reveals that the Lord will come down out of heaven clothed with a cloud, indicating that He will be wrapped up with the cloud. Do not think that He will suddenly descend from the heavens to the earth. Christ is now on the throne in the third heaven. When the proper time comes, the Father will send Him from the throne in the heavens to the cloud in the air. As we shall see in later messages, before He leaves the throne in the heavens, some overcomers will have been raptured to the throne. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105423" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span> shows that the man-child will be raptured, not to the air but to the throne of God. This indicates that some overcomers will have been raptured even before the time of the secret coming of the Lord Jesus. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105424" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14</span> we see the firstfruits on Mount Zion in the heavens. Mount Zion in the heavens is where God is in the third heaven; it is not in the air. That the firstfruits will be on Mount Zion <span class="pg" data-page-id="55" id="55">[55]</span> in the heavens proves that some of the early overcomers will be raptured to the third heaven before Christ’s secret coming. After these early overcomers have been raptured, Christ will descend from the throne to the air in the cloud secretly. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="FrpbcRt3yRk0Uxjm1URW7Eg0_gmMgO4pTrxPj1VjX3CdPg4WUZDe1ebWLRh8zhLuo">JOINT PARTAKER<br/>IN THE TRIBULATION, KINGDOM,<br/>AND ENDURANCE IN JESUS</h1><p data-content-id="Cs3ONxeMth5mwllbyYf4lOgkNyV9rIDV8RSd8O8Hqv0o7uTpEdoOJ6dbZT0nyJr-e"> In this message we need to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105480" data-verses="Revelation 1:9">1:9</span>, which says, “I John, your brother and joint partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.” The book of Revelation is composed in a marvelous way. It is quite significant that this verse comes shortly after the mention of the Lord’s coming in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105481" data-verses="Revelation 1:7">1:7</span>. This indicates that if we would be those who are watchfully waiting for the Lord’s coming back, we must be those who are joint partakers, not in outward blessing, but in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="P8jMkwpkLdBOj0p4O-2xBwjyLXEf01sfuCHBwhorQzQcIaMpTU1ljj4-xfrJokpi-">I. JOINT PARTAKER<br/>IN THE TRIBULATION IN JESUS</h2><p data-content-id="-m2NLiiFqCHFHE8nxPFGHsCUZulPS_l0yGcvkTVWCVV_Epm3QfZFd6BUh2KJg6mtY"> The phrase <em>in Jesus</em> governs the words <em>tribulation, kingdom,</em> and <em>endurance,</em> and we must pay close attention to it. This phrase very rarely occurs in the New Testament. The phrase <em>in Christ</em> or <em>in Christ Jesus,</em> on the contrary, is used many times. In the New Testament, the truth is mainly in Christ, but here the phrase <em>in Jesus</em> is employed. This tells us that if we would be those who are waiting for the Lord’s coming back, we must be those who are joint partakers in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance “in Jesus.” When we talk about salvation, grace, enjoyment, and all the other good things, we say that we are “in Christ,” for this phrase refers to everything on the positive side of God’s salvation. But to say that we are partakers of the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus means that we are suffering. When Jesus lived on earth as a man, He suffered constantly. <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> According to the facts of His life, His name, Jesus, denotes a suffering person, a man of sorrows (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105482" data-verses="Isaiah 53:3">Isa. 53:3</span>). Hence, when we say that we are in Christ, this means that we are saved, are enjoying God’s grace, have peace with God, and are under God’s blessing. But when we say that we are joint partakers of the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance “in Jesus,” this means that we are suffering and are being persecuted as we follow Jesus the Nazarene. In the book of Revelation, the <em>in Christ</em> is not used. In Ephesians, on the contrary, the term <em>in Christ</em> or <em>in Him</em> is used repeatedly, being found in every chapter of that epistle. The book of Revelation is for those who are suffering tribulation “in Jesus.” This means that those who are waiting for the coming of the Lord Jesus must be people who suffer tribulation in Jesus. In other words, those who wait for the Lord’s coming back are the suffering ones. In the eyes of God, we are the followers of Christ, but in the eyes of people, especially religion, we are the followers of Jesus. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="p1fZ6JpTsfZKO6kKI7TE51_R4WL9jFaPuaeKh7AA1i31cpyLjD9mnBPgq5VXps5uw">A. Jesus Having Suffered Persecution<br/>While He Was on Earth</h2><p data-content-id="vbXPF1aOezXsRbYDI4kOl4ymJJftHprWiEJdW-6x4LFeEqntgYHUHzSWjNe82P6MP"> While Jesus was on earth, He was persecuted by the Jewish religion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105483" data-verses="John 5:16">John 5:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105484" data-verses="John 15:20">15:20</span>). He was not persecuted by a heathen, pagan religion, but by the typical religion formed according to God’s oracles. Religion is greatly utilized by God’s enemy. Religion is versus Christ, and Christ is versus religion. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105485" data-verses="John 5:16">John 5:16</span> reveals that the Jews persecuted Jesus because He broke their Sabbath. Religious people cannot tolerate the breaking of their regulations. Any violation of their religious regulations will stir up persecution against the violators. The Jewish religion was established on three pillars, one of which was the Sabbath; the other two are circumcision and dietary regulations. When Jesus broke the Sabbath, He tore down one of the three pillars of the Jewish religion. Hence, they persecuted Him and even sought to kill Him. Eventually, religion succeeded and actually killed the Lord Jesus, sentencing Him to death according to their Scriptures. However, under the sovereignty of God, the Jews <span class="pg" data-page-id="65" id="65">[65]</span> at that time did not have the right to kill anyone. Thus, they delivered Jesus over to the Roman government and the Roman government, using its method of executing criminals, crucified the Lord Jesus on the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="Wg7ThGFRgCC6wAt8IVPuOma0L40vKK0qES7VfaycMTRB5rcUso_47aspsnn4s6CTX"> Just as religion persecuted Jesus, it will also persecute the followers of Jesus. We know from the book of Acts that the Jews in the synagogues in every city stirred up opposition against the apostles, and Paul suffered this type of persecution very much. John, the writer of the book of Revelation, also underwent this kind of persecution. When John received the revelation of this book, he was on the island of Patmos, having been exiled there for “the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.” In writing the book, he was encouraging the saints to wait for the Lord’s coming back, telling them that he was their brother and joint partaker, not in grace, life, peace, and light, but in the suffering, the affliction, in Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="1bH1BoKDaRAJxyi_xbCD4VJbThzC27bryd7u8eD4YJle8aJWRrCBJAh3feyA9YqSH"> As we have seen, when Jesus was on earth, He suffered at the hands of religion. The Roman Empire paid very little attention to Him. It was the Jewish religion that asked the Roman government to execute judgment upon Him. Thus, the persecution against Him did not originate with the secular world but with the religious world. In the book of Acts we see that it was the same with the apostles. The opposition did not come mainly from the Gentiles but from the Jewish religion. The Jews followed Paul wherever he went, perhaps even picketing him. In like manner, a great many martyrs suffered persecution by the so-called Roman Catholic Church. As Foxe points out in his history of martyrs, the Roman Catholic Church killed more saints than the Roman Empire did. Who imprisoned Madame Guyon? The Roman Catholic Church. Who imprisoned John Bunyan? The Church of England. Religion always persecutes the genuine followers of Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="9rVdP9OOQSCrvWwNpNEghXtIRf_MUbnsp2Q1i322XjDbKlbCI5SwCkdRWdaVi_g0k"> Now it is our turn to undergo this persecution. During the years I was with Brother Nee in China, I saw how much he was persecuted by religion. The rumors, opposition, and condemnation came, not from the Gentiles, but from <span class="pg" data-page-id="66" id="66">[66]</span> Christianity, even from some missionaries. The Devil is subtle. The secular world does not oppose us as much as the so-called religious people do. Many Christians think of religion as a good thing, but actually it is something used by the Devil. If you read the book of Galatians, you will see how intensely Paul persecuted the church when he was in the Jewish religion. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105486" data-verses="Galatians 1:1">Galatians 1</span> reveals that religion is against Christ and that Christ is versus religion. If we cooperate with religion, there will be a type of compromising peace. But how can we go along with religion? It is so subtle and false; it is a counterfeit of God’s economy. Anyone who sees that religion is a counterfeit of God’s economy will condemn it. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="jA4s3Ofm8UagYZF7i1Vjw0XMrL2abysDNDcRyxqadYigZpP5BmO3xTrtY6N7RJdCR">B. Jesus Now Suffering Persecution<br/>with His Followers</h2><p data-content-id="Te69zzil3D0-mAl8PfN896MAGQOo9Kaxc7b0VET_-Yefo8dz0ktoThHUcteAt6Rr5"> Because we do not cooperate with religion, it persecutes us. The persecution that we are suffering today is the persecution in Jesus. He is now suffering persecution with His followers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105487" data-verses="Acts 9:4-5">Acts 9:4-5</span>). As we are suffering today, He is suffering in and with us. When Saul of Tarsus was traveling to Damascus with the intention of arresting all those who called on the name of Jesus, the Lord Jesus knocked him down to the earth, saying, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105488" data-verses="Acts 9:4">v. 4</span>). When Saul said, “Who are You, Lord?” Jesus answered, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105489" data-verses="Acts 9:5">v. 5</span>). Saul never thought that he was persecuting Jesus. He thought Jesus was in the grave and that he was persecuting Stephen and other followers of Jesus. But according to the Lord Jesus, Saul was persecuting Him, because, at that time, He was in Stephen, Peter, John, and all His other members and was one with them. The same is true today. When the religious people persecute us, they are actually persecuting Jesus because Jesus is in us and is one with us. We may be comforted to realize that the suffering we are experiencing is the persecution in Jesus. We are joint partakers of tribulation in Jesus. <span class="pg" data-page-id="67" id="67">[67]</span> </p>

Now, as His followers, we must bear His reproach, suffering reproach from religion. This is to be a joint partaker of tribulation in Jesus. </p>

Apparently, the various points included in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105512" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">chapter one</span> are unrelated to each other. But if we approach them from the viewpoint of our experience, we shall see that they follow one another in a very good sequence. In the last two messages, we covered the matters of the coming again of the Lord Jesus and of our waiting for Him by being joint partakers in His tribulation, kingdom, and endurance. In this message we now come to the local churches. It may seem that this message on the local churches is unrelated to the two foregoing messages. But, according to our experience, we know that these three messages are all interrelated. The coming again of the Lord Jesus requires that some partake of the tribulation, the kingdom, and the endurance in Jesus. The best way to do so is to be in the local churches. Outside of the church, it is difficult for anyone to participate in these three things. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Xi707fcPG3tgdRrB8u8nSWR7_muqQB6y3SAVJIWn_neLMO9oHqhEzON_RcU2wxzw1">I. THE PROGRESS OF THE DIVINE REVELATION<br/>IN THE SCRIPTURE</h2><p data-content-id="kJtprzMv-iEybgkzNyzDTDV_E5nZwpPsrUhhtuCMESGHnnFsJwP3wtj5eeGMBki0p"> We shall approach the local churches by the way of considering the progress of the divine revelation in the Scripture. The divine revelation in the Bible begins with God and consummates with the local churches. The first two chapters of Genesis, along with the entire Old Testament, are a revelation of God Himself, and the four Gospels are a revelation of Christ. This fact reveals the progress in the divine revelation from God to Christ. Following the four Gospels, we have the Acts and the Epistles, which mainly are a revelation of Christ as the Spirit. Hence, the revelation of the Spirit is the continuation of the divine revelation in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> Bible. Following this, the church is revealed. Thus, there are four main sections of the divine revelation in the Bible: the section of God, the section of Christ, the section of the Spirit, and the section of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="J-GpZUZ4kVBIvd5R8J1AINvaohEqWRQAjWB7RQPvz7P22_9iz4SIUft-9nE0gzGry"> The Jews have only the first section of this revelation, for the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament cover only the revelation concerning God. Most Christians have more than this, having the Old Testament plus the four Gospels. Although they have the whole Bible, in practicality they have little more than the Old Testament and the Gospels. They may know God as He is revealed in the Old Testament and they may know the stories in the Gospels about Christ, but they know nothing of either the Spirit of life or the church. In the concept of many Christians, the church is a physical building. On Sunday morning, many parents say to their children, “Let’s go to church.” According to their concept, the church is a bungalow, or a cathedral, with a high tower. They know hardly anything of the church as revealed in the Holy Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="zZdlZsx_Xy-tGxScyNm6rM6fElEfBxIMErtkQIYPSIs0hDew6MtdTE2PZ2QGnjo-X"> Thank God that during the past two centuries other Christians have progressed in their knowledge of the Bible, having not only the Old Testament and the Gospels but also the Epistles. These Christians know God, Christ, and the Spirit. Of course, they do not know much about the Spirit of life. They know the Spirit mainly as the Spirit of power for baptism. They know very little of the indwelling Spirit. Although these Christians may know a little concerning the church, they only see the universal church, not the local churches. However, the first three chapters of Revelation are not concerned with the universal church; they are emphatically concerned with the local churches. </p>
<p data-content-id="aW2aGRh_13sA-UYZ1egivQxguAGN9maxrWvBvRqb8eU43xPKWs7vx4JzgzkzVkyZK"> Today, we in the Lord’s recovery have the whole Bible: the Old Testament, the Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and the Revelation. I was with the Brethren Assembly for seven and a half years. During that time, we devoted considerable attention to the books of Daniel and Revelation. However, most of what I heard concerning Revelation was about the beasts and the ten horns. I had no impression that in <span class="pg" data-page-id="75" id="75">[75]</span> the book of Revelation there were the local churches. I did not even hear much about the New Jerusalem. I was only told that it was a city in heaven with heavenly mansions, that its street was paved with gold, and that its doors were made of pearls. Praise the Lord that today our book of Revelation is not like this! In our book of Revelation, there are the local churches with the Son of Man in the midst, and there is the New Jerusalem with Christ as its centrality and universality. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="_noypB0hbJEfWHQeKjQt1I5FLvOnLX4z0lpvsRzPJX5yPZ5jO8HOWpyV1bAQCiwoF">A. Concerning God</h2><p data-content-id="BM6WPQDgbT__QB93oHAQLnlaf-U1sxHXBIVTiOGoM8gwQ4MS1D6UUKO84G9MHWJh_"> Let us now consider the progress of the divine revelation in the Scriptures in more detail. Firstly, God reveals Himself to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105513" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Gen. 1:1</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105514" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> God is revealed as Elohim, a Hebrew word meaning “the mighty One.” The English word God is the translation of the Hebrew word <em>Elohim.</em> Following this, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105515" data-verses="Genesis 2:7">Genesis 2:7</span> God is revealed as Jehovah, which means, “I am that I am.” God is the great I Am, the ever-existing One. As the ever-existing One, He is the reality of every positive thing. This name, Jehovah, denotes God in His relationship with man. Concerning His creation, God is revealed as Elohim; concerning His relationship with man, He is revealed as Jehovah. Jehovah is the Old Testament form of the name Jesus, and Jesus is the New Testament form of Jehovah. In other words, in the Old Testament Jesus was called Jehovah, and in the New Testament Jehovah is called Jesus. The entire Old Testament, which comprises thirty-nine books, is mainly a revelation of the two divine titles, Elohim and Jehovah. </p>

Concerning Christ</h2><p data-content-id="rFrCGjzy0s3seaoP5ZFz1WE5cBsBGuZn7QPczLYQpR6KGf-mSZlvxLAT6G-4WlYEl"> The second step in the progress of the divine revelation is the revelation concerning Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105516" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matt. 1:1</span>). At a certain time, God was incarnated as a man called Jesus Christ. Thus, following the Old Testament, we have the four Gospels which reveal a wonderful Person named Jesus Christ. The name Jesus mainly means the Savior (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105517" data-verses="Matthew 1:21">Matt. 1:21</span>), and the title Christ mainly means the anointed One (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105518" data-verses="Matthew 16:16">Matt. 16:16</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="76" id="76">[76]</span> Jesus is not only our Savior but also God’s anointed One or, using today’s term, God’s appointed One. God has appointed Him to carry out His eternal economy. He is not only Jesus to save us, but also Christ to carry out God’s eternal plan. </p>
<p data-content-id="dqTRyG6GA884EmjvR4UyOegfNJRGUKNc9pTPOwHALeZwBCUtG7wCY77G5UKUOOnaQ"> In order for Christ to carry out God’s eternal plan, He needs the church. And to produce the church there is the need of two things—redemption and the imparting of life. After redeeming the fallen, created man, Christ had to impart life into the redeemed ones. For this, there is the need of the Spirit of life, the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, following the four Gospels, we have redemption and the imparting of life in the Acts and the Epistles. In these books, the blood of Christ is frequently mentioned. Along with the blood, we have the Spirit. Blood is for redemption, and the Spirit is for the imparting of life. After being redeemed and regenerated, we become the living members of the Body of Christ, the church. As the church, the Body is the means by which Christ carries out God’s eternal economy. By this we see that in God’s economy the church is a very crucial matter. Without it, Christ cannot accomplish anything. If He would carry out God’s eternal plan, He must have the church. </p>

Concerning the Spirit</h2><p data-content-id="KieXqJ7jgoER4UdfBfZNeFTK0i3-sOhh6wo2bjONxSaxFCktk5VChNS7qxKtiNlUj"> God is revealed as Elohim and as Jehovah, and Christ is revealed as Jesus and as Christ. The revelation concerning the Spirit, however, is not simple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105519" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matt. 28:19</span>); rather, it is a mystery. Few Christians have ever fought for the revelation of God, and not many have fought for the revelation of Christ. But when we come to the matter of the Spirit, there is much argument because the revelation of the Spirit is a mystery. The Spirit is mysterious because it is related to life. There are many aspects of the revelation of the Spirit: the Spirit of truth or reality (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105520" data-verses="John 14:16-17">John 14:16-17</span>), the Spirit of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105521" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Rom. 8:2</span>), the Spirit of power (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105522" data-verses="Luke 24:49">Luke 24:49</span>), the Spirit of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105523" data-verses="Romans 8:9">Rom. 8:9</span>), the Spirit of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105524" data-verses="Romans 8:9">Rom. 8:9</span>), the Spirit of Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105525" data-verses="Acts 16:7">Acts 16:7</span>), the Spirit of Jesus Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105526" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">Phil. 1:19</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="77" id="77">[77]</span>), the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105527" data-verses="Acts 5:32">Acts 5:32</span>), and the seven Spirits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105528" data-verses="Revelation 1:4">Rev. 1:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105529" data-verses="Revelation 4:5">4:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105530" data-verses="Revelation 5:6">5:6</span>). </p>

Most of what this book reveals can be traced back to the Old Testament. Nevertheless, all the items found in Revelation have a new significance. For example, the city of Jerusalem, a city with twelve gates, is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105588" data-verses="Ezekiel 48:1">Ezekiel 48</span>, but at the end of Revelation we see the city of Jerusalem in a new way. Because Revelation is a book of conclusion, the fulfillment of the things in the Bible, nearly everything contained in it is presented in a new way. This is true of the lampstands in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105589" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">chapter one</span>. The lampstand is mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105590" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105591" data-verses="Zechariah 4:1">Zechariah 4</span>, but in Revelation it is mentioned in a new way. In this message we must consider the seven lampstands in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105592" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="7_7f53lSdKfhS9KELOla9Lykd8-_CW0QZ68G2Q-ukinNeICCXYLfJ8k0uws0cEQC4"> The lampstands are the symbols of the local churches. Although we have seen that the local churches are the testimony of Jesus, it may be somewhat difficult for many to grasp the meaning of this. What does it mean to say that the local churches are the testimony of Jesus? It means that the churches are the lampstands. </p>
<p data-content-id="_noypB0hbJEfWHQeKjQt1I5FLs-nMFYz0lpvsRzPJX5yPZ5jO8HOWpyV1bAQCiwoF"> Throughout the centuries, few Christians have touched the depths of the significance of the lampstand. In this message we must probe into the depths of this matter of the lampstands. Biblical symbols are difficult to comprehend, for we cannot understand a symbol like the lampstand according to our natural concept. According to our natural concept, a lampstand is simply an object holding a lamp that shines in the darkness. The lampstand in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105593" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span> is pure gold, and the lampstands in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105594" data-verses="Zechariah 4:1">Zechariah 4</span> and Revelation also are golden. Substantially, the lampstand is golden. With the <span class="pg" data-page-id="90" id="90">[90]</span> lampstand we see three important things: the gold, the stand, and the lamps. The lampstand implies the significance of the Triune God. Gold is the substance with which the lampstand is made, the stand is the embodiment of the gold, and the lamps are the expression of the stand. The gold signifies the Father as the substance, the stand signifies the Son as the embodiment of the Father, and the lamps signify the Spirit as the expression of the Father in the Son. Thus, the significance of the Triune God is implied in the lampstand. </p>
<p data-content-id="BM6WPQDgbT__QB93oHAQLnlaf9k1qj3XBIVTiOGoM8gwQ4MS1D6UUKO84G9MHWJh_"> On the walls of Jewish synagogues there is a symbol of the lampstand. Although the Jews have used this symbol for centuries, they do not know its real significance—the significance of the Triune God. Have you ever realized that the lampstand implies the significance of the Triune God? </p>
<p data-content-id="xsF1VTQ6uNmvQ0gsEZfYs9IbLS4TNSFzV_mWIqnjliKoXml2ZS6zTzBkq4NzheEv5"> Substantially, the lampstand is one, but expressively, it is seven because it is one lampstand with seven lamps. At the bottom, the lampstand is one; at the top, it is seven. Should we argue about whether it is one or seven? In substance, the lampstand is one piece of gold, but it holds seven lamps. This mysteriously indicates that substantially the Triune God is one. In substance, He is one, but in expression, He is the seven Spirits. The Father as the substance is embodied in the Son as the form, and the Son is expressed as the seven Spirits. </p>
<p data-content-id="rFrCGjzy0s3seaoP5ZFz1WE5cCcBO8Jn7QPczLYQpR6KGf-mSZlvxLAT6G-4WlYEl"> How can we prove that the seven lamps are the Spirit expressing Christ? The seven lamps are first mentioned in Exodus. If we only had the record in Exodus, however, it would be difficult to realize that these seven lamps are the Spirit. But as we proceed from Exodus to Zechariah, we see that the seven lamps are the seven eyes of Christ and the seven eyes of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105595" data-verses="Zechariah 3:9">Zech. 3:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105596" data-verses="Zechariah 4:10">4:10</span>). As we continue on to Revelation, we see that the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven eyes which are the intensified Spirit of God. Hence, we have a strong basis for saying that the seven lamps are the sevenfold intensified Spirit as the expression of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="w61C8Sf0pRjO1CqIL2kXUnSo4spG3UbXzFDh5Au7smcx1nKys-XlikrZOIVeRdjoV"> We have seen that the lampstand implies the significance of the Triune God; it symbolizes the Triune God embodied <span class="pg" data-page-id="91" id="91">[91]</span> and expressed. God the Father as the divine gold is embodied in Christ the Son and then is fully expressed through the Spirit. The expression differs from the embodiment. The embodiment must be uniquely one because our God is uniquely one. Thus, the embodiment must be one stand. The expression, however, must be complete, and complete in God’s move. Recall that seven is the number for completion in God’s move. Throughout the centuries, God has been expressed in His move. This is the reason that the seven lamps signify the intensified Spirit as the expression of Christ in God’s complete move. This is the practical understanding of the Trinity. The Trinity is for the dispensing of God into humanity. God, the divine Being, is firstly embodied in Christ and then expressed through the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Now we not only have the Triune God; in the lampstand we have the Triune God substantially and solidly embodied and expressed. The gold has been formed into the solid stand. It once was just gold, but now it is the stand. The gold has been formed into a stand for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. Without the stand, there is no way for God’s purpose to be fulfilled. As we have seen, this stand, which is a type of Christ, is expressed through the seven lamps signifying the seven Spirits of God. The seven Spirits of God are not separate from God; they are the seven eyes of God and of the Lamb, the Redeemer. As we shall see, they are also the seven eyes of the building stone. Hence, they are the seven eyes with the redemption of Christ for God’s building. Whenever these eyes look at people, they are redeemed and built into God’s house. This is the Trinity. </p>
<p data-content-id="LT7GHt_97QehEFI0vw7uvsMOpkvI-77JAK6-4yadHVCpNEmCwmz8MPsIjIZIRoY7N"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105597" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span> the emphasis is upon the stand, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105598" data-verses="Zechariah 4:1">Zechariah 4</span> the emphasis is upon the lamps, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105599" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1</span> the emphasis is upon the reproduction. In both Exodus and Zechariah, the lampstand is one, but in Revelation it has been reproduced and has become seven. Firstly, in Exodus the emphasis is on the stand—on Christ. Secondly, in Zechariah the emphasis is on the lamps—on the Spirit. Eventually, in Revelation both the stand and the lamps, that is, both Christ and the Spirit, are reproduced as the <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> churches. In Exodus and Zechariah there are just seven lamps, but here in Revelation there are forty-nine lamps, for every lampstand has seven lamps. Hence, the one lampstand has become seven and the seven lamps have become forty-nine. The lampstands with their lamps in Revelation are the reproduction of Christ and the Spirit. When Christ is realized, He is the Spirit, and when the Spirit is realized, we have the churches as the reproduction. </p>
<p data-content-id="mQZCaUskgKXnWQwz5-GjAk8SvTdCbWcUewFvjwcuYXvkPdWSc6wkDFGa6M3STyygs"> The church is not only universally one but also expressed locally in many cities. In the whole universe there is only one Christ, one Spirit, and one church. Why then are there the seven churches? Because of the need for an expression. For existence, one is sufficient, but for expression, many are needed. If we would know the church, we must know its substance, existence, and expression. Substantially, the church, and even all the churches, are one. In expression, the many churches are the many lampstands. What is the church? The church is the expression of the Triune God, and this expression is seen in many localities on the earth. The church is signified not by just one lampstand—but by seven lampstands. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105600" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1</span> there are seven lampstands with forty-nine lamps shining in the universe. This is the testimony of Jesus. The church is the testimony of Jesus. This means that the church is the expression of the Triune God substantially and expressively. Substantially, it is of one substance in the whole universe; expressively, it is many lampstands with the lamps shining in the darkness to express the Triune God. The Father as the substance is embodied in the Son, the Son as the embodiment is expressed through the Spirit, the Spirit is fully realized and reproduced as the churches, and the churches are the testimony of Jesus. If we see this vision, it will govern us and we shall never be divisive. This vision will hold us, guard us, and keep us in the testimony of Jesus. </p>

Having covered the first seven points, we come in this message to the eighth—the Son of Man in the midst of the churches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105644" data-verses="Revelation 1:12-20">1:12-20</span>). In this book, Christ is firstly revealed as the Son of Man. Whenever He is related to the church, He is revealed in His human nature because the church is composed of human beings. The Head of the church is not only the Son of God but also the Son of Man. That the Lord is still the Son of Man after His ascension indicates that He has not put off His human nature after resurrection and that His dealings with us are based upon His humanity. As a man, He succeeded in being God’s testimony. Thus, we in the churches today, being human, can also be God’s testimony. The Lord was victorious as a man, and we can be victorious also. </p>
<p data-content-id="4GbJibLcKEjqL__jjhGizlp7yetonss18dd9DdMU_NFm4J0W2ehtPh_Rk31LQn9uY"> Christ today is “in the midst of” the churches. On the one hand, as the High Priest, He is interceding in the heavens for the churches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105645" data-verses="Hebrews 9:24">Heb. 9:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105646" data-verses="Hebrews 7:25-26">7:25-26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105647" data-verses="Romans 8:34">Rom. 8:34</span>), and, on the other hand, He is moving in the churches to care for them. If we would participate in His move and enjoy His care, we must be in the churches. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="oD3lMOXIl6z0Onm43O-zok5YluHXd7f6DEIcHzOKTKEbP0Se8eYZQKaye2uoCCFov">I. IN HIS HUMANITY</h2><p data-content-id="38DbLjkjfrpGOnLvrDZzvLBGzk0AD03T0zpiuZ_ALgyZ1yVY5W1UVpbk1LrYnnGZ3"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105648" data-verses="Revelation 1:13">Verse 13</span> says, “And in the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="102" id="102">[102]</span> feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle.” Christ is not only depicted here as the High Priest, as shown by His garments, but also unveiled “like the Son of Man.” He is still both divine and human. As our High Priest, He is caring for the churches in His humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="GYIVpUWkuZmHSrN-tf6YUfoxq5_657W-OL81T49tkhetZaHINSoSt6T3Ue9-usg-C"> Throughout the centuries, some so-called Christians have taught that Christ was not the Son of God. Even today, there are some so-called Christians who do not believe that Christ is the Son of God. To deny that Christ is the Son of God is heretical. Such a teaching is devilish and comes from Hades, and we must uncompromisingly stand against it. Some Christians, on the contrary, do not believe that Christ today is still the Son of Man. They say that Christ became a man by incarnation, but that in His resurrection He put off His humanity. Some of these Christians think that today Christ is merely the Son of God, no longer being the Son of Man. When about fifteen years ago I fought against this concept, some opposed me saying that it was erroneous to teach that Christ is still the Son of Man. While some Christians do not believe that Christ is the Son of Man today, we believe it. According to the pure Word, the Lord Jesus is still both the Son of God and the Son of Man. We cannot explain this adequately because our mind is so limited. Nevertheless, we believe and accept the fact that our Christ is both the Son of God with divinity and the Son of Man with humanity. In Him we have true divinity and proper humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="cgfMaJYFAO1mOpI22kRdhJ3KaYFLcGwHK7fr4_AyvD4ITdSSCh7v-cnqPDc7CCaPG"> During the past nineteen centuries, especially during the first six centuries, Christology was a subject of intense controversy among Christians. Concerning the Person of Christ there have been differing opinions, and Christians have fought with one another about them. We must drop all these so-called theological schools. According to the Bible, we believe that our Christ is truly the Son of God and the Son of Man. He has two natures, divinity and humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="OPc0C_l9lbNcoMQBRuTefKizKrZFY1ZNF3gAaE0-NZcyLxO2KT0pWsR4uiaTts0_i"> When Christ comes to deal with us in the churches, He does so not only in His divinity but also in His humanity. <span class="pg" data-page-id="103" id="103">[103]</span> You may excuse yourself, thinking that the Lord could make it because He was the Son of God, but that since you are human the Lord must sympathize with you. As the Son of God, the Lord is quite capable, but you, as a mere son of man, are pitiful, and the Lord should not condemn you so much. But when He comes to us as the Son of Man, you have no excuse. He also was a man and made it as a man, not as the Son of God. Do not make any excuses for yourself. If you are defeated and fail in the church life, do not sympathize with yourself, saying that it is excusable because you are only a human being. Human beings are just the right material for the church life. Thus, in the midst of the churches, Christ is walking as the Son of Man. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105649" data-verses="Daniel 3:1">Daniel 3</span> we are told that the Son of God was walking in the fire, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105650" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1</span> we see that it is the Son of Man who is walking in the midst of the churches. We all must worship Him as the Son of Man. Because He is both human and divine, He is such a wonderful One. Because He is both divine and human, He knows heaven and earth, God and man. In Him we have divinity and humanity. In Him we are in the heavens and also are on the earth. Today the Lord is both in the heavens and on the earth walking, in His humanity, in the midst of the local churches. </p>

Although the word <em>priest</em> is not mentioned here, we know by His garment that Christ is depicted here as the High Priest. Today, the Son of Man, Jesus Christ, who is walking in the midst of the churches, is a Priest. Among the three offices of priest, prophet, and king, the most dear, intimate, precious, and lovely office is that of the priest. The priest is so dear and lovely because he takes care of the people. As Christ walks among the churches, He takes care of them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="104" id="104">[104]</span> </p>

This is quite meaningful. The priests in the Old Testament were girded at the loins for their ministry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105656" data-verses="Exodus 28:4">Exo. 28:4</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105657" data-verses="Daniel 10:5">Daniel 10:5</span> Christ is also girded with fine gold at His loins. But here Christ as our High Priest is “girded about at the breasts.” The breasts signify love. To be girded at the loins is to be strengthened for work, whereas to be “girded about at the breasts” signifies care in love. Christ’s work in producing the churches has been accomplished. Now He no longer needs to be girded at His loins for work. What He is doing now in the midst of the churches is to care for them in love. This requires Him to be “girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle.” This “golden girdle” signifies divine strength. Christ is now exercising a divine care over the churches, moving among them in His humanity and caring for them with His divine strength. What a loving care He exercises over His churches today! </p>

The black hair with which the Lord is depicted in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105660" data-verses="Song of Songs 5:11">Song of Songs 5:11</span> signifies His unfading and everlasting strength, but the white hair with which He is depicted here signifies His ancientness. </p>

Wool is not made white; it is born white, and its whiteness comes out of its nature. White wool is the color of Christ’s nature. His ancientness is of His nature. Snow is white because it comes from heaven and contains no earthly dirt or stain.

These seven churches are excellent illustrations, revealing the local churches, not in doctrine, but in actual practice. By considering these seven churches we can see clearly what a local church is and should be. </p>
<p data-content-id="eMGG8SZW5aKYwACjfS3uY0Bv9Mr8apvpNMYqz5sYFrO7IjSJfZqHiVhS_6SOouZ-_"> The seven epistles in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105707" data-verses="Revelation 2:1">chapters two and three</span> are the record of the actual situation existing in the seven churches at the time these epistles were written. However, since this book is a book of signs with a prophetic nature, the situations of the seven churches are also signs, signifying prophetically the progress of the church in seven stages. The first epistle, to the church in Ephesus, affords a picture of the church at the end of the first stage, during the last part of the first century. The second epistle, to the church in Smyrna, prefigures the suffering church under the persecution of the Roman Empire, from the last part of the first century to the early part of the fourth century, when Constantine the Great, the Caesar of the Roman Empire, brought the church into imperial favor. The third epistle, to the church in Pergamos, pre-symbolizes the worldly church, the church married to the world, from the day Constantine accepted Christianity to the time the papal system was established in the latter part of the sixth century. The epistle to the church in Thyatira depicts prophetically the apostate church, from the ordination of the papal system in the latter part of the sixth century to the end of this age, when Christ comes back. The fifth <span class="pg" data-page-id="114" id="114">[114]</span> epistle, to the church in Sardis, prefigures the Protestant church, from the Reformation in the early part of the sixteenth century to Christ’s coming back. The sixth epistle, to the church in Philadelphia, predicts the church of brotherly love, the recovery of the proper church life, from the early part of the nineteenth century, when the brothers were raised up in England to practice the church life outside all denominational and divisive systems, to the second appearing of the Lord. The seventh epistle, to the church in Laodicea, foreshadows the degraded church life of the brothers in the nineteenth century, from the latter part of the nineteenth century until the Lord’s return. In this message and the following six messages we shall treat each of these churches respectively. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gvNTj0qyHK7fxM7muDqwkXAD9m1POovbfrgDct-kby-g5UvD45-QA3Mzygn6Yx6f"> In this message we come to the church in Ephesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105708" data-verses="Revelation 2:1-7">2:1-7</span>). The crucial words in this message are love, life, and light. The basic requirement for having the church life is our love toward the Lord. There is no problem, of course, with the Lord’s love toward us. He has loved us and He continues to love us. The problem is with our love toward Him. Although we have loved Him in the past and may love Him now, there is the danger that our love for the Lord Jesus might fade. The epistle to the church at Ephesus warns us of this. This letter also gives us a clear revelation of the source of the degradation of the church life—the fading of the first love. As we shall see, love gives us the position, the ground, the right, and the privilege to eat of the tree of life. Love gives us the supply of life. If we love the Lord, we shall have the full right to enjoy Him as the tree of life, as our life supply. Light always follows life, issuing out of the abundant supply of life. Life gives us light. In the tabernacle the lampstand comes after the showbread table, indicating that when we enjoy Christ as our life supply, we shall have the light of life. It is vitally important that we love the Lord. If we have love, then we shall have the life symbolized by the tree of life and the light signified by the lampstand. </p>
<p data-content-id="Np0A3NXGY9sb0kEPalq_4D5FyBbc3pzsiVnvh4Vd3iry7xMwdQWdiN4zotccxw5rB"> In brief, the problem with the church at Ephesus was the fading of the first love toward the Lord. Because of this, <span class="pg" data-page-id="115" id="115">[115]</span> the Lord came in to deal thoroughly with this church, warning her that if she did not repent, she was in danger of having her lampstand removed. Anyone among them who would repent and return to his first love would be considered by the Lord to be an overcomer. The Lord promised the overcomer the right to enjoy Him as the tree of life. Of course, the lampstand will always remain among those who have overcome. However, if we would not repent of our fading love toward the Lord, we will miss the right to eat of the tree of life and the lampstand will be removed from us. If this were the case, we would be without love, and light. What a pitiful condition this would be! </p>

Before the Lord says anything to the churches, He declares who He is. In the first epistle, the Lord declares that He is the One who holds the seven stars in His right hand and who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands. These two items prove that the Lord is so normal, genuine, and proper. He cares for the churches by holding the leading ones in His right hand and by walking among all the churches. The messengers of the churches, the spiritual ones, signified by the shining stars, who bear the responsibility of the testimony of Jesus, are held in the right hand of the Lord, and the Lord is walking in the midst of the churches, signified by the seven golden lampstands. What a wonderful scene! While the Lord is sitting at the right hand of God as our High Priest interceding for us, the churches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105710" data-verses="Hebrews 7:25">Heb. 7:25</span>), He is holding the messengers of the churches and is walking in the midst of the churches to care for them. </p>

This signifies <span class="pg" data-page-id="116" id="116">[116]</span> that the initial church at its end was still desirable to the Lord; the Lord still had much expectation in her. </p>

The church in Ephesus was neither idle nor sloppy; she was quite good in working for the Lord. </p>

We must differentiate between work and labor. Labor is higher than work. While work is ordinary, labor is special. Those who worked full time on our meeting hall in Anaheim not only worked—they labored. If we had hired a contractor and had used union workers, they would have worked without laboring. </p>

The word <em>men</em> is not found in the Greek. I believe that the Lord’s word here regarding evil includes two things—evil men and evil matters. The church in Ephesus did not tolerate anyone or anything evil. It certainly was a good church. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="kJtprzMv-iEybgkzNyzDTDV_F4XZ07vsrUhhtuCMESGHnnFsJwP3wtj5eeGMBki0p">E.

This church was very discerning, trying the false apostles and rejecting them. They discerned that the self-assumed apostles were false.

He chose seven cities in Asia Minor: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. According to the Greek, the name of each city is very meaningful, exactly matching its spiritual significance. As we have pointed out, Ephesus means desirable, indicating that the church in Ephesus was precious to the Lord and desirable in His eyes. In Greek Smyrna means myrrh. Myrrh is a sweet spice which, in figure, signifies suffering. In typology, myrrh signifies the sweet suffering of Christ. Thus, the church in Smyrna was a suffering church, prefiguring the church under the persecution of the Roman Empire from the latter part of the first century to the early part of the fourth century. This persecuted church suffered in the sweetness and fragrance of Christ. In other words, this church was in the tribulation of Jesus and in the fellowship of His sufferings. The church in Smyrna suffered as Christ Himself did, having become a continuation of His suffering. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105819" data-verses="Colossians 1:24">Colossians 1:24</span> Paul said that he filled up “that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church.” Paul was completing the sufferings of Christ. Although no one can continue Christ’s redemption, His sufferings must be completed by all His followers both individually and collectively. In the church in Smyrna we see the collective continuation of the sufferings of Jesus. Because this church was a continuation of Jesus’ suffering, it was truly the testimony of Jesus. <span class="pg" data-page-id="130" id="130">[130]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="Te69zzil3D0-mAl8PfN896MAHR-o7YKxc7b0VET_-Yefo8dz0ktoThHUcteAt6Rr5"> Let us now consider the speaker to the church in Smyrna. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105820" data-verses="Revelation 2:8">verse 8</span> the Lord says, “These things says the First and the Last, who became dead, and lived again.” The Lord told this suffering church that He was the First and the Last. This means that no matter how great were the sufferings through which He passed, those sufferings could not terminate or damage Him. He was the First and eventually He was also the Last. In suffering, the church must know that the Lord is the First and the Last, the ever-existing, unchanging One. Whatever the environment may be, He remains the same. Nothing can precede Him, nor can anything exist after Him. All things are within the limit of His control. </p>
<p data-content-id="nvHEdQi38H-SlLL6P9OfVCFAvnB28jHv2jZt6ZG6aLbP35LOw849ym4uqoStVA0ft"> When the Lord told the church in Smyrna that He was the First and the Last, He was indicating that the church had to be victorious. The church should not be frustrated by any type of suffering. She must pass through all the sufferings and come to the end, because the Lord, who is the life and Head of the church, is the First and Last. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="6gUudY5_FgkP0IWCRfIYS9bkojAOkC5MuZnMLKGfCY9m8DxWQTymsdYcJHe9YM_1B">B. The One Who Became Dead and Lived Again</h2><p data-content-id="D08BEZDWCoGzl9aRgkuTZIQB3FDk0_zSwTEtOAeTiI-pN0qDlIp5_x909EdoSb6yb"> In this verse the Lord also said that He is the One “who became dead, and lived again.” “Lived again” means resurrection. The Lord suffered death and lived again. He entered into death, but death could not hold Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105821" data-verses="Acts 2:24">Acts 2:24</span>) because He is the resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105822" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span>). The suffering church also needs to know Him as such a One that she may endure all kinds of suffering. However severe the persecution may be, the church will still be alive, for the resurrection life of Christ within her can endure death. The most suffering or persecution can do is kill us. Following the death from persecution, there is resurrection. Therefore, the Lord seemed to be telling the suffering church, “You must realize that I am the One who was persecuted to death. But that death was not the end—it was the gateway into resurrection. When I <span class="pg" data-page-id="131" id="131">[131]</span> entered into death, I came into the threshold of resurrection. Do not be frightened by persecution, nor terrified at the prospect of being killed. You must welcome death and be happy, for once you have passed into death you also will be on the threshold of resurrection. Remember, I am the One who became dead and lived again.” Whatever we need, the Lord is. His qualifications exactly match our need. To the suffering church, the Lord is not only the First and the beginning but also the Last and the end. Whenever you are undergoing persecution, you must rise up and declare, “Hallelujah, I am going to the end, to the last. I am about to enter into the gateway of resurrection.” </p>

<p data-content-id="eMGG8SZW5aKYwACjfS3uY0Bv9M78e7_pNMYqz5sYFrO7IjSJfZqHiVhS_6SOouZ-_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105823" data-verses="Revelation 2:9">verse 9</span> the Lord said to the church in Smyrna, “I know your tribulation.” The content of this epistle is nothing but tribulation, suffering, and persecution. To the church, tribulation is a test of life. The extent to which the church experiences and enjoys the resurrection life of Christ can only be tested by tribulation. Moreover, tribulation also brings in the riches of the resurrection life of Christ. The Lord’s purpose in allowing the church to suffer tribulation is not only to testify that His resurrection life overcomes death, but also to enable the church to enter into the riches of His life. Hence, tribulation is precious to the church. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="5gvNTj0qyHK7fxM7muDqwkXAD921IdIvbfrgDct-kby-g5UvD45-QA3Mzygn6Yx6f">B. Poverty (Yet Being Rich)</h2><p data-content-id="Np0A3NXGY9sb0kEPalq_4D5FyBLcx6DsiVnvh4Vd3iry7xMwdQWdiN4zotccxw5rB"> The Lord said, “I know your tribulation and poverty, but you are rich.” The Lord did appraise this suffering church. The suffering church was poor in material things, but rich in the Lord with the riches of His life. Thus, the Lord seemed to be saying, “You are suffering tribulation and poverty, yet you are rich. You are poor physically, but you are rich spiritually. You are poor in earthly things, but you are rich in heavenly things.” Suffering persecution is the means to bring us into the riches of Christ. The more we are persecuted and suffer poverty, the richer we are in Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="132" id="132">[132]</span> </p>

The slander of the Judaizers toward the suffering church was their evil criticism of her. The Judaizers were Jews in flesh, but not Jews in spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105825" data-verses="Romans 2:28-29">Rom. 2:28-29</span>). Merely being the seed of Abraham in the flesh did not constitute them true Jews. “Those who are the children of the flesh are not the children of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105826" data-verses="Romans 9:7-8">Rom. 9:7-8</span>). Therefore, the Lord said that they “call themselves Jews and are not.” These Judaizers stubbornly insisted upon keeping their Judaistic system consisting of the Levitical priesthood, the sacrificial rituals, and the material temple, which were all types now fulfilled and replaced by Christ. Since the Church under the new covenant in God’s economy had no part in their religious practice, the Judaizers slanderously criticized her. In principle, it is the same today in that religious people slander the churches in the Lord’s recovery which seek the Lord and follow Him in spirit and in life and do not care for any religious system or practice. </p>

As we have pointed out, the name of each of the seven cities is very meaningful. In Greek Pergamos means “marriage,” implying union, and “fortified tower.” As a sign, the church in Pergamos prefigures the church which entered into a marriage union with the world and became a high fortified tower, equivalent to the great tree prophesied by the Lord in the parable of the mustard seed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105870" data-verses="Matthew 13:31-32">Matt. 13:31-32</span>). When Satan failed to destroy the church through the persecution of the Roman Empire in the first three centuries, he changed his strategy. He sought instead to corrupt her through Constantine’s welcoming her as the state religion in the first part of the fourth century. Through Constantine’s encouragement and political influence, multitudes of unbelieving ones were baptized into the “church,” and the “church” became monstrously great. Since the church is a spouse to Christ as a chaste bride, her union with the world is considered spiritual fornication in the eyes of God. </p>

THE CHURCH’S MARRIAGE TO THE WORLD</h2><p data-content-id="Cs3ONxeMth5mwllbyYf4lOgkMzV9nIDV8RSd8O8Hqv0o7uTpEdoOJ6dbZT0nyJr-e"> In the epistle to the first church, the Lord advised the church in Ephesus to repent and to recover her first love. We must believe that His advice was heeded, for the second church, the church in Smyrna, truly loved the Lord and suffered persecution and became a suffering church. According to the facts of history, during the first three centuries, the church suffered a great deal as the Roman government tried its best to damage her. Eventually, the enemy, Satan, realized that persecution did not work very well. Therefore, being the subtle one, he changed his strategy from persecuting the church to welcoming her. In the early part of the fourth century, Constantine the Great accepted Christianity and made it a state religion. From that time onward, Christianity became a type of Roman state church. This welcoming of the church by the Roman Empire ruined her, because it caused the church to become worldly. As we all know, the church has been called out of the world and has been separated from the world to God. However, by being welcomed by the Roman Empire, the church went back to the world and, in the eyes of God, even married the world. God considers this type of worldly union to be spiritual fornication. </p>
<p data-content-id="P8jMkwpkLdBOj0p4O-2xBwjyKWEf41sfuCHBwhorQzQcIaMpTU1ljj4-xfrJokpi-"> Due to this marriage, the church lost her purity and became worldly. Because the church had entered into union with the world, many worldly things came into the church. Worldly things are related to idol worship, for worldliness is always associated with idolatry. The church in Pergamos firstly became worldly and then idolatrous. Satan saturated her with the world and with idols. As a result, the church became absolutely different from what God intended her to be. God desires a church which is outside of the world, having nothing to do with the world. The church must be a golden lampstand, the pure expression of the Triune God, and must have no connections with the world. But after the Roman Empire had made the church a worldly religion, she became altogether impure, worldly, and idolatrous. <span class="pg" data-page-id="141" id="141">[141]</span> </p>

Since the church has entered into union with the world and has become worldly herself, she now dwells where Satan dwells—in the world. </p>

This also refers to the world. The world is not only Satan’s dwelling place, but also the sphere wherein he rules. Now the church is not only one with the world but even one with Satan. This is dreadful! The worldly Christianity of today is still in union with the world and is still being saturated with the thoughts, concepts, theories, and even the practices of Satan. We must see the seriousness of this. </p>
<p data-content-id="zZdlZsx_Xy-tGxScyNm6rM6fFkUfIioMErtkQIYPSIs0hDew6MtdTE2PZ2QGnjo-X"> The enemy, Satan, is subtle. His welcome is more serious than his persecution. Firstly, Satan stirs up persecution, and then, when this fails, he changes his tactics and welcomes us instead. We have seen this very thing in the past. Firstly, religion persecuted us, and then, changing its strategy, tried to lure us into compromising with it. This is Satan’s subtlety. If we are snared by it, we shall eventually become worldly and not only be in union with Satan, but also one with him. The Lord has included the seven epistles in the book of Revelation that we may see the true situation of so-called Christianity and also see where and what the church should be. The church should be a pure golden lampstand outside of the world. The church must have nothing to do with the world and must not yield an inch to Satan’s evil and subtle saturation. The church must constantly stand against this. </p>
<p data-content-id="aW2aGRh_13sA-UYZ1egivQxgvBWN11qxrWvBvRqb8eU43xPKWs7vx4JzgzkzVkyZK"> The two meanings of the word <em>Pergamos</em>—“marriage” and “fortified tower”—correspond to two of the parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105873" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span>, the parable of the great tree (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105874" data-verses="Matthew 13:31-32">Matt. 13:31-32</span>) and the parable of the leaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105875" data-verses="Matthew 13:33">Matt. 13:33</span>). In the parable of the great tree, a tiny mustard seed became a tree. This undoubtedly signifies monstrous Christianity, for Christianity has certainly become a great tree. In the parable of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="142" id="142">[142]</span> leaven, we read of a woman who put leaven into three measures of fine flour. Leaven signifies all the sinful, worldly, evil, satanic, demonic, and devilish things. All these wicked things were put into the fine flour. In the Bible, the fine flour used in the meal offering signifies Christ as food for God’s people. The great tree is the equivalent of the high tower, and the woman with the leaven is the equivalent of the apostate church which has married the world. The meaning of the Bible in this matter should be very clear to us all. In the eyes of God, Christendom is a great whore, an evil woman who has mixed worldly, demonic, satanic, and devilish things with the good things of Christ to produce a hellish mixture. We must absolutely abandon this great tree, escape from this high tower, come out of this evil system, and be separated to God, returning to His original intention that the church be a pure golden lampstand having nothing to do with worldliness, idolatry, or Satan’s saturation. We are not in the place where Satan dwells, in the place where Satan sits on his throne. No, in the church there is no ground for Satan. Here there is no place for Satan to do anything. </p>

The history of the church from the first century to the present is clearly divided into seven stages: the initial stage, the suffering stage, the worldly stage, the apostate stage, the stage of Reformation, the stage of the recovered church, and the stage of the degradation of the recovered church. In this message we must consider the church in Sardis, the church in reformation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105961" data-verses="Revelation 3:1-6">3:1-6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="qFT3je7o6rEOFRguDp8CG0dTnpaY_eLv-CuesvcrtybeUNGaiOI26ePMHk72T6-ua"> Sardis in Greek means “the remains,” “the remainder,” or “the restoration.” As a sign, the church in Sardis prefigures the Protestant Church from the time of the Reformation to the second coming of Christ. The Reformation was God’s reaction to the apostate Roman Catholic Church, signified by the degraded church in Thyatira. It was accomplished by a minority of the believers, the remainder. Hence, it was the restoration by the remainder. </p>

To the church in Ephesus, Christ is the One who holds the seven stars and walks in the midst of the seven lampstands. The initial church needed the care of Christ, and her leaders needed <span class="pg" data-page-id="170" id="170">[170]</span> His keeping grace. To the church in Smyrna, He is the One who became dead and lived again. The suffering church needed the resurrection life of Christ. To the church in Pergamos, Christ is the One who has the sharp two-edged sword. The degraded, worldly church needed His judging and slaying word. To the church in Thyatira, He is the One who has eyes like flaming fire and feet like shining brass. The apostate church needed His searching and judging. Now to the church in Sardis, He is the One who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars. The dead reformed church needs the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God and the shining leaders. </p>
<p data-content-id="06HaLz-rodl0AfizE_p5q65Gsxe-og05Vzf9t1pdh1RDT-1G6VyoGGe03xNQWK59K"> If we examine the situation of Protestant Christianity today, we shall see that it lacks the seven Spirits. Their deadness is due to the lack of the seven Spirits. Because of their organization, they also need the shining stars. This is all they need—the intensified Spirit and the shining stars. However, they do not pay attention to the seven Spirits. The seven Spirits are the full intensified realization of Christ as the Spirit. This is not a matter of the so-called Pentecostal or charismatic movement, but of the indwelling sevenfold intensified Spirit. This is what dead Protestantism needs today. It also needs the shining stars, not the positions or the organization. Their leading ones must be shining ones. </p>

<p data-content-id="8xVo-B7NrMY0kPDgZqBD43ILIrr-R9mwuq3Joqe2LOC9AD1rboXiIgCBQAwKW-c3U"> To the messenger of the church in Sardis the Lord says, “I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and you are dead. Become watchful and establish the things which remain, which were about to die; for I have not found your works completed before My God.” These two verses present a full picture of the so-called Protestant Church. The reformed Protestant Church has been considered to be living, but the Lord says that she is dead. Hence, in her dead condition, she needs the living Spirits and the shining stars. <span class="pg" data-page-id="171" id="171">[171]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="06HaLz-rodl0AfizE_p5q65Gsxe-hy05Vzf9t1pdh1RDT-1G6VyoGGe03xNQWK59K">B.

Though these things were restored, they “were about to die.” Hence, the Protestant Church needs revivals to keep things alive. This is the actual situation of the Protestant churches. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="_noypB0hbJEfWHQeKjQt1I5FKv-nLW4z0lpvsRzPJX5yPZ5jO8HOWpyV1bAQCiwoF">C. Having No Work Completed</h2><p data-content-id="BM6WPQDgbT__QB93oHAQLnlae-k1swHXBIVTiOGoM8gwQ4MS1D6UUKO84G9MHWJh_"> The Lord also said, “I have not found your works completed before My God.” Nothing begun in the Reformation has ever been completed. Therefore, the church in Philadelphia is needed for the completion. In the eyes of God, there are no complete works in the so-called reformed churches. Do not think that justification by faith is completed among them. If you have the inner sight, you will see that the justification by faith recovered by Martin Luther was quite shallow, for Luther did not touch justification very much in the way of life, but mainly in the way of doctrine, in a superficial way. We thank the Lord for this great servant of God, but he was not perfect. None of the work under his hand was completed. The things recovered in the days of Luther have been dying and are still about to die. This is why so many Protestant churches have frequent revivals. </p>
<p data-content-id="xsF1VTQ6uNmvQ0gsEZfYs9IbKR4TEBFzV_mWIqnjliKoXml2ZS6zTzBkq4NzheEv5"> The crucial point about the fifth church is that it is dead and dying. While it has a name that it is living, actually it is dead. Many of us can testify that when we were saved, we were quite living. But after getting into a denominational church, we were put into the refrigerator and, after a few months, we cooled down and died. The reformed churches are deadening. I was raised in a so-called Protestant church and I know that there is absolutely no life there. In nearly every way, it is filled with death. </p>

Since the reformed Protestant churches are dead, they will be unaware of the Lord’s coming as a thief in His secret appearing to His seekers. Hence, there is the need of watchfulness. </p>
<p data-content-id="lNulM8LrKW8XhGNjyhb8z8_RBARcsEhrAM_UAfWfx_DwAjiko112RRWMunPS7zWYR"> The revelation in the New Testament regarding the Lord’s second coming is not according to our natural understanding. According to our natural thought, the Lord will suddenly descend from the throne in the heavens to the earth. This thought has caused much difficulty to the students of the Bible, and we must drop it. In understanding anything found in the Bible, we should have no trust in our thoughts, and we should never apply our natural concepts. This is why we need a clear, renewed mind when we come to the Word of God. We must drop the colored eyeglasses of our concepts and come to the pure Word. The Lord’s coming back is a process. His coming back will begin from the throne and will pass through a process until He descends to fight the battle at Armageddon. As we have pointed out, the Lord will descend from the throne to the air where He will accomplish many things: the rapture of the majority of the saints, the judgment at the judgment seat, and the wedding of the Lamb. After all this has been accomplished in the air, the Lord will descend to the earth. The rapture of the early overcomers, including the man-child (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105967" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">ch. 12</span>) and the firstfruits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105968" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">ch. 14</span>), will occur at the start of the process of the Lord’s coming back. In other words, when they are raptured, the process of the Lord’s coming back begins. </p>

Suddenly, some of the believers who are <span class="pg" data-page-id="173" id="173">[173]</span> the early overcomers will be taken away. No one knows the time of the beginning of the process of the Lord’s coming back and of the rapture of the early overcomers. When it comes, there will be no time for you to prepare yourself. You must be thoroughly prepared before that time. Therefore, we must be prepared, ready, and watchful. </p>

In Greek, Philadelphia means brotherly love. As a sign, the church in Philadelphia prefigures the proper church life recovered by the brothers who were raised up by the Lord in England in the early part of the nineteenth century. Just as the reformed church, prefigured by the church in Sardis, was a reaction to the apostate Catholic Church, prefigured by the church in Thyatira, so the church of brotherly love is a reaction to the dead reformed church. This reaction will continue as an anti-testimony to both apostate Catholicism and degraded Protestantism until the Lord comes back. </p>

He Who Has the Key of David</h2><p data-content-id="4GbJibLcKEjqL__jjhGizlp7zdtorss18dd9DdMU_NFm4J0W2ehtPh_Rk31LQn9uY"> To the recovered church, the Lord is also the One who has “the key of David” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106004" data-verses="Revelation 3:7">v. 7</span>), the key of the kingdom, with authority to open and to shut. Not many know the meaning of the term <em>the key of David.</em> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106005" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, when God created man, He gave him dominion over all creatures. This indicates that, in God’s intention, man is to be the <span class="pg" data-page-id="182" id="182">[182]</span> power representing God on earth. Due to the fall, however, man lost this power and has never fully recovered it. Man has not regained dominion on earth to represent God. In the lives of Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, and Noah we do not see this power. Neither do we see it in the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. We do not see this power until God’s chosen people, the children of Israel, entered into the good land and built the temple. Apparently, the temple was built by Solomon; actually, it was built by David, for he was behind the building of the temple. Remember what is revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106006" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span>. God made man in His own image that he might express Him and with His dominion that he might represent Him. The temple is related to God’s image because, being God’s house, it is His expression. The temple was built in the city. The temple signifies God’s expression, and the city signifies God’s dominion. The image and dominion revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106007" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> are, to some extent at least, fulfilled in the temple and the city. In the temple we have God’s presence for His expression, and in the city we have God’s dominion. God’s king is in the city representing Him as he rules on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="nvHEdQi38H-SlLL6P9OfVCFAvmB21xnv2jZt6ZG6aLbP35LOw849ym4uqoStVA0ft"> This is a necessary background for understanding what the key of David is. The key held by David is the key of God’s entire dominion. God’s dominion includes the whole universe, especially mankind. This dominion has a key which is possessed by the person who fought the battle for the kingdom and who made preparations for the temple. The name of this person is David. David represented God in establishing God’s kingdom on earth. Hence, he has the key of God’s dominion in the universe. David, however, was just a type, not the reality. The real David is Christ, the greater David. He is the One who built God’s temple, the church, and established God’s kingdom. Therefore, in the church today, which is both a house and a kingdom, we have God’s expression and representation. As the greater David, Christ has built up the house of God, the real temple, and He has set up the kingdom of God, the dominion in which He exercises full authority to represent God. Thus, He holds the key of David. <span class="pg" data-page-id="183" id="183">[183]</span> The key of David is something representing God to open the whole universe for God. This is the key of David held by Christ. This term signifies that Christ is the center of God’s economy. He is the One who expresses and represents God, the One who holds the key to open everything in God’s dominion. </p>

<p data-content-id="sgITvoUbLp9kr7so-lifik0UGiic_l2aWiA8xIiSnO6y-U0RpWzmI90zjb8ycRLz9"> As we have pointed out, nearly everything found in the book of Revelation is not new but a fulfillment of things revealed in the Old Testament. This is also true of the key of David. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106009" data-verses="Isaiah 22:22-24">Isaiah 22:22-24</span> is a prophecy concerning Christ as the One who holds the key of David. The deep thought in Christ’s holding the key of David is found there. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106010" data-verses="Isaiah 22:1">Isaiah 22</span> it was prophesied that Christ would not only be the One holding the key of David, but that He would also be a nail or peg. Very few Christians have heard that Christ is a nail. If you consider the context of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106011" data-verses="Isaiah 22:1">Isaiah 22</span> and if you read the context of the word regarding Christ as the One holding the key of David in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106012" data-verses="Revelation 3:1">Revelation 3</span>, you will realize that Christ’s holding the key of David is for God’s house, for God’s building. The crucial subject in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106013" data-verses="Isaiah 22:1">Isaiah 22</span> is the house of God. And the epistle to the church in Philadelphia eventually speaks of the New Jerusalem. The overcomers in Philadelphia will be pillars in the temple of God, and the temple of God will ultimately be enlarged into the New Jerusalem. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106014" data-verses="Revelation 21:22">Revelation 21:22</span>, there is no temple in the New Jerusalem, for, in eternity, the temple will be enlarged into a city, which, having three equal dimensions (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106015" data-verses="Revelation 21:16">21:16</span>), will be the enlargement of the Holy of Holies. This is the ultimate consummation of God’s house. Christ’s holding the key of David, fighting the battle for God, and building the temple and establishing the kingdom of God are all for God’s building. <span class="pg" data-page-id="184" id="184">[184]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="w61C8Sf0pRjO1CqIL2kXUnSo5v5G3VbXzFDh5Au7smcx1nKys-XlikrZOIVeRdjoV"> Christ holds the key of David and He opens and shuts, not that we might be holy or spiritual, but that we might be built up. He does not care for so-called holiness or spirituality. During the past two centuries, certain people claimed to be holy and spiritual. Although they saw something, they were rather short-sighted. Holiness is not for holiness, and spirituality is not for spirituality. Both holiness and spirituality are to enable us to be pillars in the temple of God. Eventually, we shall not bear the name of holiness or spirituality but of the New Jerusalem. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106016" data-verses="Revelation 3:12">3:12</span> the Lord did not say, “I will write holiness upon you,” or, “I will write spirituality upon you”; He said, “I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.” What we have here is neither holiness nor spirituality but God and the New Jerusalem. God’s purpose is not to make us holy or spiritual; it is to make us part of the New Jerusalem. God already has all the holiness He needs, but He does not yet have the New Jerusalem. God’s desire is not for more spirituality. He is seeking the New Jerusalem. God desires a builded church. He wants today’s Bethel, the house of God which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Are you willing to see this? </p>
<p data-content-id="LT7GHt_97QehEFI0vw7uvsMOon_I-67JAK6-4yadHVCpNEmCwmz8MPsIjIZIRoY7N"> When I saw this light eighteen years ago, I made a strong declaration in my message that God does not want spirituality. Some opposers took this sentence out of context and said, “Listen, Witness Lee says that we don’t need spirituality and that God does not want spirituality.” In that message I said again and again that any spirituality which is not for God’s building is not genuine. Our spirituality must be tested by the church life. If our spirituality does not fit into the church life, it is an abnormal spirituality. It does not supply the Body; rather, it is a cancer. Many so-called spiritual persons are cancers. Cancer is a disease of the cells in the body. Unlike germs, cells are constituents of the body, and there is nothing wrong with them. But if the cells are not properly balanced and become too concentrated, they will develop into a cancer. The so-called spirituality that <span class="pg" data-page-id="185" id="185">[185]</span> cannot be tested, adjusted, or balanced and that cannot fit into the building of the church is a cancer. </p>

In Greek Laodicea means the opinion, the judgment, of the people or of the laymen. The church in Laodicea as a sign prefigures the degraded recovered church. Less than a century after the Lord recovered the proper church in the early part of the nineteenth century, some of the recovered churches (“assemblies”) became degraded. This degraded recovered church differs from the reformed church signified by the church in Sardis, and also differs from the proper recovered church signified by the church in Philadelphia. It will exist until the Lord comes back. </p>
<p data-content-id="EquHWEovemLQ65DjOF9kgzpp7tCOAkesiQtpIkUhAc0HmLnNxgDapPV_nZlY4Z7aR"> Some Christian teachers consider the church in Laodicea as the cold reformed church. Strictly speaking, this is not so. According to the context and according to history, the church in Laodicea must be a sign of the degraded recovered church. Approximately one hundred fifty years ago the recovered church began in England. According to what we have read, it was wonderful. It was a real recovery of the church life. However, it did not last very long. If you read the history of the Brethren and if you visit them today, you will see that many of the Brethren assemblies have become the church in Laodicea. As we shall see, although they are proud of their Bible knowledge, they are poor in the enjoyment of the riches of Christ and blind in spiritual things. </p>

So because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to vomit you out of My mouth.” Once the recovered church becomes degraded, it is lukewarm—neither cold nor hot. This is the actual condition of so many Brethren assemblies today. This should be a warning to us. Once we become lukewarm, we are not fitting for the Lord’s move and shall be vomited out of His mouth. </p>

<p data-content-id="GYIVpUWkuZmHSrN-tf6YUfoxr6P6wr2-OL81T49tkhetZaHINSoSt6T3Ue9-usg-C"> The most outstanding feature of those in the degraded assemblies is their pride. They think they know everything. Undoubtedly, they have much knowledge in doctrine. They do know the Bible better than those in the denominations. Although, in a sense, they know the Bible, what they have is mere knowledge. Because they have this knowledge, they consider themselves rich. But the Lord says that they actually are poor. They are not poor in knowledge, but they are poor in the riches of Christ. They have the knowledge concerning Christ, but they are poor in the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. Shortly after coming to this country, I was invited to speak in three Brethren assemblies. After speaking there and hearing what they said in response, I was completely convinced of the truth of the Lord’s word to the church in Laodicea. If you were to stay with them for a short while, you would sense that they are proud of their knowledge. In their conversation they condemn the ignorance of others, thinking that they know everything. However, after staying with them, you would realize the poverty among them. They simply do not realize the riches of Christ or even talk about them. </p>

This is for our justification before God. After being justified in Christ, we need to live by Christ and to live out Christ, that He may be our subjective righteousness as another splendid robe to cover our daily walk. Due to the lack of the subjective experience of Christ, the degraded recovered church is naked in the eyes of the Lord.

The degraded recovered church needs to pay a price for the gold, white garments, and eyesalve, which she desperately needs. After having contact with the Brethren assemblies, I realized that probably no one among them understands what it means to pay a price. Perhaps they have never heard that they must pay some price in order to experience the riches of Christ. They know the knowledge and doctrine, but they do not know how to pay the price. They know how to learn, but they do not know how to buy. They know certain “truths,” but they do not know the cost of experiencing the riches of Christ. </p>

Beginning with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106091" data-verses="Revelation 4:1">chapter four</span>, this book unveils God’s universal administration. The throne of God in Revelation is the center of God’s administration. While the throne in the Epistles is the throne of grace from which we receive mercy and find grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106092" data-verses="Hebrews 4:16">Heb. 4:16</span>), the throne here is the throne of judgment from which the world receives judgment. This is God’s throne in heaven. The whole universe, especially the earth, is under this throne. Whatever Satan does in the air and <span class="pg" data-page-id="214" id="214">[214]</span> whatever man does on earth is under God’s throne in heaven. Today, man may do anything he likes, but the throne of God in heaven is still the authority over all men and all things. No one can do anything and nothing can happen outside of the rule of God’s throne. Apparently, this throne is invisible and is not realized by man, but actually it is behind the scene ruling over everyone and everything. In God’s time and for the fulfillment of God’s purpose, the appropriate judgment always comes out of this throne to mankind and upon the things transpiring on earth. In the book of Revelation, the consummate issue comes from the completion of the execution of God’s judgment. This judgment proceeds from the throne and clears up the confusion both in heaven and on earth caused by Satan’s rebellion and man’s fall. </p>

In this book, God will judge the earth with all its inhabitants. The rainbow around His throne signifies that God is the covenanting God, the faithful God, who will keep His covenant while executing His judgment upon the earth in that He will not judge mankind again with a flood nor destroy all mankind, but will keep some to be the nations of the earth for His glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106095" data-verses="Revelation 21:24">21:24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106096" data-verses="Revelation 21:26">26</span>).

In the Epistles, out of the throne of grace come the mercy and grace of God for anyone who approaches Him through the redeeming blood of Christ. But here, out of the throne of judgment come forth lightnings, voices, and thunders as warnings to the sinful world. In the book of Revelation, after all God’s judgments have been executed, the throne of God will be the throne of eternal life supply, out of which will proceed the river of water of life with the tree of life growing in it. All the believers who are participating in God’s mercy and grace today by approaching God’s throne of grace will enjoy the river of life and the tree of life out of God’s throne as their life supply for eternity, while the unbelievers, who will be judged by God’s throne of judgment, will have no share in the eternal enjoyment issuing out of God’s eternal throne. </p>

Here the seven lamps are for God’s judgment, which will issue also in God’s building—the building of the New Jerusalem.

This sea is not of water, but of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106105" data-verses="Revelation 15:2">15:2</span>). Since the deluge, God, in accordance with His promise not to judge the earth and living creatures again with water (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106106" data-verses="Genesis 9:15">Gen. 9:15</span>), always exercises His judgment upon man with fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106107" data-verses="Genesis 19:24">Gen. 19:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106108" data-verses="Leviticus 10:2">Lev. 10:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106109" data-verses="Numbers 11:1">Num. 11:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106110" data-verses="Numbers 16:35">16:35</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106111" data-verses="Daniel 7:11">Dan. 7:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106112" data-verses="Revelation 14:11">Rev. 14:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106113" data-verses="Revelation 18:8">18:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106114" data-verses="Revelation 19:20">19:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106115" data-verses="Revelation 20:9-10">20:9-10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106116" data-verses="Revelation 21:8">21:8</span>).

The flame of God’s judging fire sweeps all negative things in the entire universe into this glassy sea, which eventually becomes the lake of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106118" data-verses="Revelation 20:14">20:14</span>). The glassy sea, being the aggregate of all God’s fiery judgment, is “like crystal,” signifying that every negative thing under God’s judgment is crystal clear. Whatever is judged and kept in the glassy sea is fully exposed; nothing is hidden. In this chapter we have the rainbow around the throne of God, signifying that God will keep His promise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106119" data-verses="Genesis 9:8-17">Genesis 9:8-17</span>, and we also have the glassy sea of fire, indicating that God will still judge all negative things with fire. </p>

<p data-content-id="udGqnkRQe0Fa75Rq062nBbUbDMeCv-JuLLQkayoHbSEK216rHpUxhj5eVqRJadTMc"> When John saw the throne set in heaven, he saw “One sitting upon the throne, and He who was sitting was like in appearance to a jasper stone and a sardius, and there was a rainbow around the throne like an emerald in appearance.” God on the throne has the appearance of a jasper stone. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106120" data-verses="Revelation 21:11">21:11</span>, jasper is “a most precious stone...clear as <span class="pg" data-page-id="217" id="217">[217]</span> crystal.” Its color must be dark green, which signifies life in its richness. Jasper here, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106121" data-verses="Revelation 21:11">21:11</span> indicates, signifies God’s communicable glory in His rich life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106122" data-verses="John 17:22">John 17:22</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106123" data-verses="John 17:2">2</span>). It is the appearance of God, which will also be the appearance of the holy city, New Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106124" data-verses="Revelation 21:11">21:11</span>). The city’s wall and first foundation are built with it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106125" data-verses="Revelation 21:18-19">21:18-19</span>). In the Bible green signifies life. Thus, the color of jasper indicates that the God who is sitting on the throne is the very God of life. God’s color firstly is green, testifying that He is the source of life. </p>

Throughout the centuries, many wise men have earnestly tried to learn what the secret of this universe is. Because they did not have the revelation, they failed. In the book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible, we have an unveiling of God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="LT7GHt_97QehEFI0vw7uvsMOokvI4pLJAK6-4yadHVCpNEmCwmz8MPsIjIZIRoY7N"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106180" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">5:1</span> the One sitting on the throne has a scroll in His hand sealed with seven seals. These seven seals are actually the contents of the scroll and the contents of the book of Revelation, for this book is the opening, the unveiling, of the seven seals. The scroll itself must be the new covenant, the grand title deed enacted with the blood of the Lamb. The new covenant is a scroll covering the redemption of the church, Israel, the world, and the universe. The book of Revelation is a record of God’s thought concerning the church, Israel, the world, and the universe. When Christ died on the cross, He tasted death not only for man, but for everything (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106181" data-verses="Hebrews 2:9">Heb. 2:9</span>). Here we see the secrecy of God’s administration in the universe. While the New Testament was enacted by the death of <span class="pg" data-page-id="224" id="224">[224]</span> Christ, it has been a mystery to mankind. The new covenant is the secret of the universe and the content of the book of Revelation. As we read Revelation, we must realize that in vision after vision we are seeing what is included in this new covenant, what is contained in this secret and sealed scroll. </p>
<p data-content-id="mQZCaUskgKXnWQwz5-GjAk8SuTdCSEcUewFvjwcuYXvkPdWSc6wkDFGa6M3STyygs"> Now, after Christ’s ascension, there should no longer be a secret, for it has been unsealed by Christ’s death, resurrection, and ascension. Before His death, there was a mystery that no man knew anything about. But by His death, resurrection, and ascension, He has fulfilled all of God’s requirements. Thus, as we shall see, He has opened the mystery and revealed it to John, charging him to commit it to writing. Therefore, this book is just the opened secret, or scroll, in God’s hand. It is no longer a secret—it is an open mystery. Now, as we are reading the book of Revelation, we are reading the contents of the scroll that has been unsealed by the ascended Christ. This is a great matter, and few Christians are aware of it. Most Christians have the book of Revelation, but not many have the unsealed scroll, because they do not realize that Revelation is the unsealed scroll. </p>

When John first saw the scroll, it was still sealed. If we had been there, we, like John, certainly would have been desirous to see what was contained in that scroll. But John “wept much because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.” If actually no one worthy was found in the whole universe, we would surely need to weep, for the whole universe would be vanity, with none qualified to unveil its secret. If there were no Christ in this universe, the whole universe would weep. But there is Christ, and we do not need to weep. </p>

We have pointed out that nearly everything in Revelation is a fulfillment of what is mentioned in the Old Testament. Christ is the fighting, victorious, and overcoming Lion. He has won the battle. Hence, His overcoming qualifies Him to open the scroll and its seven seals. </p>
<p data-content-id="D08BEZDWCoGzl9aRgkuTZIQB3HTk0-zSwTEtOAeTiI-pN0qDlIp5_x909EdoSb6yb"> Although the angel told John to behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106184" data-verses="Revelation 5:6">verse 6</span> says, “I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain.” The angel recommended Christ as the Lion, but John saw Him as the Lamb. As the Lion, He is the Fighter against the enemy; as the Lamb, He is the Redeemer for us. He has fought to redeem us, and He has won the battle over the enemy and accomplished redemption for us. To the enemy, He is a Lion; to us, He is a Lamb. Although the angels do not need redemption, they need someone to defeat the enemy of God, for one among them became God’s enemy. Thus the angels realize that there is a need for someone to defeat this rebel. To the angels, Christ was the Lion who defeated the rebel, but to us, including the apostle John, Christ is the Lamb, the redeeming One. We need Christ’s redemption. As we have already pointed out, in the universe there are two main problems—Satan and sin. As the Lion, Christ has defeated and destroyed Satan, and as the Lamb, He has taken away our sin. He has won the victory and He has accomplished redemption. Now He is the Lion-Lamb. </p>

Therefore, as His forefather, David called Him “the Lord” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106190" data-verses="Matthew 22:42-45">Matt. 22:42-45</span>). He is the root of David. In our concept, Christ was born of David, so He was a descendant of David. But here it says that Christ is the root of David, meaning that David grows out of Christ. The Bible also says that Christ is the branch of David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106191" data-verses="Jeremiah 23:5">Jer. 23:5</span>). Hence, He is both the root and the branch. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106192" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1">Isaiah 11:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106193" data-verses="Isaiah 11:10">10</span> we see that Christ is also a branch and root of Jesse. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gvNTj0qyHK7fxM7muDqwkXAD_m1IeIvbfrgDct-kby-g5UvD45-QA3Mzygn6Yx6f"> We have seen that Christ is both a descendant and the root of David. In the eyes of God, David was the unique person who fought the battle and gained authority, fighting the battle for God and gaining His full authority. That Christ, the Lion-Lamb, is the root of this person means that He is greater than David. This is why He holds the key of David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106194" data-verses="Revelation 3:7">3:7</span>). Whatever David was, had, and did was altogether out of this root. Therefore, as the root of David, Christ is more powerful and more victorious than David and has more of God’s divine authority. </p>

It is evident that the rider of the second horse, the red horse, is war (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106228" data-verses="Revelation 6:4">v. 4</span>); the rider of the third horse, the black horse, is famine (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106229" data-verses="Revelation 6:5">v. 5</span>); and the rider of the fourth horse, the pale horse, is death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106230" data-verses="Revelation 6:8">v. 8</span>). According to historical facts, the rider of the first horse, the white horse, must be the gospel, not, as some interpret, Christ or Antichrist. Immediately after Christ’s ascension, these four things—the <span class="pg" data-page-id="234" id="234">[234]</span> gospel, war, famine, and death—began to run like riders on four horses and will continue until Christ comes back. Beginning with the first century, the gospel has been spreading throughout all these twenty centuries. War has also been proceeding simultaneously. War always causes famine, and famine issues in death. All these will continue until the end of this age. </p>

The Rider of the White Horse</h2><p data-content-id="2dKAFOptUaVJ1O8CsbCZpWVpffXfeVbrD3ZULTjfRG56qNxhXho1DQvZyTnlBjLC6"> The rider of the white horse is the preaching of the gospel. White signifies clean, pure, just, and approvable. The white horse is a symbol of the preaching of the gospel, which is clean, pure, just, and approvable both to men and to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="udGqnkRQe0Fa75Rq062nBbUbDP-Cv8JuLLQkayoHbSEK216rHpUxhj5eVqRJadTMc"> Some have said that the rider on the white horse is Christ, and others have claimed that the rider is the Antichrist. After much study, we learned that neither of these concepts is right. In interpreting the Bible we must follow the principle. The principle here is that the riders on the four horses are not persons but personified things. The rider on the second horse is war, the rider on the third is famine, and the rider on the fourth is death. None of these are persons but rather are personified things. Following this principle, the rider of the first horse must also be a personified thing. Therefore, the rider can be neither Christ nor Antichrist. According to the principle, this rider must also be a personification. After much consideration, we have seen that this rider must be the preaching of the gospel. </p>

But here there is a bow without an arrow. This indicates that the arrow has already been shot to destroy the enemy, and the victory has been won for the constitution of the gospel of peace. Now the fighting is over, and the gospel of peace is proclaimed in a <span class="pg" data-page-id="235" id="235">[235]</span> peaceful way. On the cross, the arrow was shot into the heart of the enemy, the battle was fought, and the victory was won. Therefore, the bow without an arrow is a declaration that the war is over and that the victory has been won. </p>

The gospel has been crowned with “the glory of Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106233" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:4">2 Cor. 4:4</span>, Gk.), and it is called the gospel of the glory of Christ. The gospel we preach is the gospel crowned with the glory of Christ. We not only preach the gospel of grace, but also the gospel of glory. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="kJtprzMv-iEybgkzNyzDTDV_F6HZ36PsrUhhtuCMESGHnnFsJwP3wtj5eeGMBki0p">3. Going Forth Conquering</h2><p data-content-id="J-GpZUZ4kVBIvd5R8J1AINvapikqQCAAjWB7RQPvz7P22_9iz4SIUft-9nE0gzGry"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106234" data-verses="Revelation 6:2">Verse 2</span> also says that the rider on the white horse “went forth conquering and that he might conquer.” Throughout all the centuries, wherever the gospel is proclaimed, it has conquered and has overcome all kinds of opposition and attack and it is still conquering today. We are not told that the riders on the second, third, and fourth horses went forth conquering. Only the rider on the first horse, the preaching of the gospel, has been conquering continuously. Wherever the preaching of the gospel goes, there is this conquering. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="zZdlZsx_Xy-tGxScyNm6rM6fFmkfIhoMErtkQIYPSIs0hDew6MtdTE2PZ2QGnjo-X">B.

And I saw, and behold, another, a red horse went forth; and to him who sits on it, to him it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they should slay one another; and a great sword was given to him.” Red here signifies the shedding of blood. Thus, the red horse is a symbol of the raging of war, which is altogether a matter of shedding blood. “To take peace from the earth,” “they should slay one another,” and “a great sword was given to him” all clearly indicate war. Since Christ’s ascension, the preaching of the gospel has been followed by war. <span class="pg" data-page-id="236" id="236">[236]</span> </p>

And I saw, and behold, a black horse; and he who sits on it having a balance in his hand. And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying: A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenixes of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.” Here, black, indicating the dearth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106237" data-verses="Jeremiah 14:1-4">Jer. 14:1-4</span>), signifies the color of the visage of famished people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106238" data-verses="Lamentations 4:8-9">Lam. 4:8-9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106239" data-verses="Lamentations 5:9-10">5:9-10</span>). The black horse is a symbol of the spreading of famine, which causes a black visage. A balance is a scale used to weigh precious things. But here it is used to weigh food, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106240" data-verses="Revelation 6:6">verse 6</span>, thus showing the scarcity of food (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106241" data-verses="Leviticus 26:26">Lev. 26:26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106242" data-verses="Ezekiel 4:16">Ezek. 4:16</span>). Oil and wine are for man’s pleasure (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106243" data-verses="Psalms 104:15">Psa. 104:15</span>). They are always short and become precious in famine. During a famine, oil and wine should be preserved and not harmed. Famine always follows war, for war causes food to be scarce. If there were another war today, the world would have a food shortage. </p>

The Rider of the Pale Horse</h2><p data-content-id="8xVo-B7NrMY0kPDgZqBD43ILIo7-S9Gwuq3Joqe2LOC9AD1rboXiIgCBQAwKW-c3U"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106244" data-verses="Revelation 6:7-8">Verses 7 and 8</span> say, “And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, a pale horse, and the name of him who sits upon it is Death; and Hades followed him. And authority was given to them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with famine and with death and by the beasts of the earth.” The rider on the fourth horse is clearly identified as death. The word translated <em>pale</em> may also be rendered <em>pale green,</em> signifying the color of the appearance of those stricken with the plague. Thus, the pale horse is a symbol of the killing of death, causing a pale appearance. Hades is the place under the earth where the souls of the unsaved dead are kept before being resurrected for the judgment of the white throne (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106245" data-verses="Revelation 20:11-15">20:11-15</span>). After this judgment, the unsaved will be cast into the lake of fire for eternity. Hades may be likened to a temporary jail, and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="237" id="237">[237]</span> lake of fire to a permanent prison. Here Hades follows death to receive those whom death kills. The killing by beasts mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106246" data-verses="Revelation 6:8">verse 8</span> is God’s judgment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106247" data-verses="2Kings 2:24">2 Kings 2:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106248" data-verses="2Kings 17:25">17:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106249" data-verses="Numbers 21:6">Num. 21:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106250" data-verses="Exodus 23:28">Exo. 23:28</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106251" data-verses="Joshua 24:12">Josh. 24:12</span>). </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="Xi707fcPG3tgdRrB8u8nSWR79neqWB6y3SAVJIWn_neLMO9oHqhEzON_RcU2wxzw1">THE CRY OF THE MARTYRED SAINTS<br/>AND GOD’S ANSWER TO IT<br/>SEALS FIVE AND SIX</h1><p data-content-id="kJtprzMv-iEybgkzNyzDTDV_G4XZypPsrUhhtuCMESGHnnFsJwP3wtj5eeGMBki0p"> In this message we shall consider the fifth and sixth seals. According to the record of Revelation, the first four seals are not consecutive. Rather, they are simultaneous. They all began to take place at nearly the same time and they will conclude at the same time. It is very similar to a four-horse race where the horses begin and end at almost the same time. The seven seals may be divided into two groups consisting of the first four seals and the last three seals. While the first four seals are not consecutive, the last three seals are consecutive. </p>
<p data-content-id="J-GpZUZ4kVBIvd5R8J1AINvaqg0qURQAjWB7RQPvz7P22_9iz4SIUft-9nE0gzGry"> As we have seen, the first four seals unveil the new testament age, which is an age of gospel preaching. Between Christ’s ascension and His coming back, the preaching of the gospel will continue. The other main things—war, famine, and death—work together for the advancement of the preaching of the gospel. God has a unique purpose in this age—to have the gospel preached that the church might be produced and built up for the fulfillment of His eternal plan. We need to have this overall view. But the great men on earth do not have this view. Not even the kings and the presidents of the nations know what they are doing. But we know. Everything these rulers do helps the preaching of the gospel. God is sovereign in this matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="zZdlZsx_Xy-tGxScyNm6rM6fGk0fPxIMErtkQIYPSIs0hDew6MtdTE2PZ2QGnjo-X"> The book of Revelation begins with the local churches with Christ in their midst and it ends with the New Jerusalem with Christ as its centrality and universality. Between these two ends of Revelation, we have the church age and the kingdom age. In the church age, the new testament age, <span class="pg" data-page-id="242" id="242">[242]</span> God is doing one thing: He is producing the churches through the preaching of the full gospel. All twenty-seven books of the New Testament are included in the full gospel. God’s purpose is not merely to save a group of pitiful sinners. This concept is too low, and many of the philosophical people refuse to accept it. They need to see that the preaching of the gospel has a much higher purpose and that it is on the highest plane—producing the churches for the composition of the New Jerusalem. After the church age, the kingdom age will come. In the kingdom age God will accomplish what has not been completed and perfected in the church age. After the age of the kingdom, God’s purpose will be thoroughly and absolutely completed. Then there will be eternity with the new heaven, the new earth, and the New Jerusalem composed of all the redeemed saints. This is a general view of the whole universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="aW2aGRh_13sA-UYZ1egivQxgsB2NzmaxrWvBvRqb8eU43xPKWs7vx4JzgzkzVkyZK"> As we have already pointed out, through the first four seals, we have a view of what is taking place between Christ’s ascension and His coming back. Four things are transpiring: the preaching of the gospel, war, famine, and death. The second, third, and fourth horses help to speed up the preaching of the gospel. If there had been no war, I would not be in this country. In the past, none of us in the Lord’s recovery in China intended to come to the western world. We thought that perhaps after we had finished a certain amount of recovery work, the Lord would then use some other people or means, perhaps missionaries or the translation of the books, to bring the recovery to the western world. But suddenly, in 1949, mainland China was lost. As a result, the Lord’s recovery was brought to this country. Having been sent to Taiwan by the work, I was deeply troubled by the loss of the Lord’s recovery in mainland China. Day and night, I asked the Lord, “What is this? Why has the work been lost?” Eventually, the sovereign Lord brought His recovery to this country. This reveals that, in the sovereign hand of the Lord, there is only one thing in this age—the preaching of the full gospel to produce the local churches for the building up of God’s eternal dwelling place, the New Jerusalem. When we <span class="pg" data-page-id="243" id="243">[243]</span> have this overall view, we can look into the book of Revelation and understand it adequately and properly. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="by2v23Nedf13WGfghX9I29Vruxl_lARCOuCyECvjxyFHKSsKwXMqeaZkYrTMh3eTi">I. THE CRY OF THE MARTYRED SAINTS—<br/>THE FIFTH SEAL</h2><p data-content-id="qFT3je7o6rEOFRguDp8CG0dTkoaYzeLv-CuesvcrtybeUNGaiOI26ePMHk72T6-ua"> The seven seals are firstly divided into four and three, and secondly into six and one. The number four signifies the creatures, as symbolized by the four living creatures, and the number six signifies creation, since creation was finished in six days. The number three signifies the Triune God, and the number one the unique God. Hence, both four plus three and six plus one indicate that the seven seals, through God’s judgment, bring God’s creation with all the creatures to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gvNTj0qyHK7fxM7muDqwkXAA9m1IcIvbfrgDct-kby-g5UvD45-QA3Mzygn6Yx6f"> The fifth seal discloses the Christian martyrdom from the first century to the time near the end of this age. (It may include the martyrdom of the old testament saints—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106252" data-verses="Matthew 23:34-36">Matt. 23:34-36</span>.) While the gospel is being preached, as indicated by the first seal, there is always the martyrdom of the faithful saints. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Np0A3NXGY9sb0kEPalq_4D5FxBbcx7DsiVnvh4Vd3iry7xMwdQWdiN4zotccxw5rB">A. The Martyrdom</h2><p data-content-id="tICK0kqpdw83viGh_xTywHd_bpRXvWog1o4YjOZhdjbM1vmCFYdIuEXfD_WST4Dgf"> During the age of gospel preaching, many saints have been martyred because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. Stephen, Peter, and nearly all the other apostles were martyred. The apostle John was exiled, and Paul was imprisoned and later sentenced to death. Throughout the centuries, wherever the preaching of the gospel has gone, there has been martyrdom. Thousands of those who have been faithful to the Lord’s testimony have been martyred. In a sense, even Brother Nee was martyred. Nearly all my older co-workers suffered martyrdom during the past twenty-six years by being kept in prison until they died. </p>
<p data-content-id="hhHSRpGa6c8nmBYQbhmi3QAUBQovvpnv3LkGuqyF8VwAmEhhWitCawAl83I6gzdpk"> The martyrdom of the saints is not because of their opposition to any human rules, but because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. The word of God is the glad tidings, the gospel, they proclaim to people. The testimony of Jesus is the life they live. Human society with human <span class="pg" data-page-id="244" id="244">[244]</span> culture is wholly under the evil influence of Satan, as it says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106253" data-verses="1John 5:19">1 John 5:19</span>, “the whole world lies in the evil one.” Both the preaching of the word of God and the life of the testimony of Jesus are against the satanic trend in the world. Certainly Satan hates this. Hence, whenever and wherever the saints preach the word of God and live the testimony of Jesus, Satan instigates people to persecute them, even to death. This is a fighting, not between men and the saints, but between Satan and God. The time will come when God will avenge the saints by exercising His righteous judgment over the earth which is under Satan’s evil influence. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="UbDmKnrbR6wkXMKUDOIMD2P-iCWyL_FZE9lFaopaqfOk7Tikcu1gMU62N3Lsd0fR0">B. The Cry</h2><p data-content-id="MfMdlEkgq-a1uKaUUALpAADpEcSSkmjRfcVofpiZYMm5RgH8fZWaM9MIilSy8MI87"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106254" data-verses="Revelation 6:10">Revelation 6:10</span>, speaking of “the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and because of the testimony which they held,” says, “And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O sovereign Lord, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106255" data-verses="Revelation 6:9">6:9</span> we see that the souls are underneath the altar. This points to the sacrifices killed on the altar. When a sacrifice was killed on the altar, its blood flowed down to and under the bottom of the altar. The soul of the flesh is in the blood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106256" data-verses="Leviticus 17:11">Lev. 17:11</span>). That the soul of the martyred saints are under the altar indicates that, in the eyes of God, they have all been offered to God as sacrifices on the altar and that their blood, their life, was shed there. Now their position is under the altar. In figure, the altar is in the outer court of the tabernacle and the temple, and the outer court signifies the earth. Hence, “underneath the altar” is underneath the earth, where the souls of the martyred saints are. It is the paradise where the Lord Jesus went after His death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106257" data-verses="Luke 23:43">Luke 23:43</span>). It is in the heart of the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106258" data-verses="Matthew 12:40">Matt. 12:40</span>), and should be the comfortable section of Hades, where Abraham is (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106259" data-verses="Acts 2:27">Acts 2:27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106260" data-verses="Luke 16:22-26">Luke 16:22-26</span>). </p>

This chapter is not the continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106303" data-verses="Revelation 6:1">chapter six</span>. It is an insertion between the sixth and seventh seals, showing how God cares for His people while He is about to execute His judgment upon the earth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106304" data-verses="Revelation 8:1">Chapter eight</span> is the continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106305" data-verses="Revelation 6:1">chapter six</span>. At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106306" data-verses="Revelation 6:12">chapter six</span> we have the sixth seal, and in the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106307" data-verses="Revelation 8:1">chapter eight</span> we have the seventh. The opening of the seventh seal will bring in the seven trumpets, the last three of which constitute the great tribulation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106308" data-verses="Revelation 8:1-2">8:1-2</span>). But before this transpires, God will seal the Israelites whom He intends to preserve (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106309" data-verses="Revelation 7:3">7:3</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="BM6WPQDgbT__QB93oHAQLnlad_01oj3XBIVTiOGoM8gwQ4MS1D6UUKO84G9MHWJh_"> God will preserve His two peoples—the Israelites and the redeemed saints. Why does this insertion regarding God’s preservation of His people come here? Because in the sixth seal we see the warning of the coming tribulation. As we have seen, the fifth seal is the cry of the martyred saints for revenge, and the sixth seal is God’s answer to this cry, which is also a warning to the dwellers on the earth that the tribulation will soon come. Since the ascension of Christ, there have been a great number of earthquakes and other calamities. All these have been natural calamities. However, beginning at the opening of the sixth seal, the calamities will no longer be natural but supernatural. Both natural and supernatural calamities are God’s punishment upon the earth. This rebellious earth deserves God’s punishment, and the punishing hand of God has never been removed from it. To a certain extent, God punishes the earth for His purpose. Since the ascension of Christ, God has been punishing the earth. <span class="pg" data-page-id="252" id="252">[252]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="xsF1VTQ6uNmvQ0gsEZfYs9IbJQoTDSFzV_mWIqnjliKoXml2ZS6zTzBkq4NzheEv5"> One aspect of God’s punishment is seen in the destruction of the city of Jerusalem by Titus and his armies. That destruction was prophesied by the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106310" data-verses="Matthew 24:2">Matthew 24:2</span> where, speaking of the temple, He said to His disciples, “See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.” Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus for two reasons: because the Jewish religion was rebellious against God’s economy and because this religion was a negative influence on the church in Jerusalem. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106311" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span> we see how much the old Jewish religion influenced the church. By the time of A.D. 70 the Lord could no longer tolerate the rebellion of the Jewish religion and its influence upon the church, so He sent the Roman army to destroy Jerusalem and the temple. That destruction was a terrible punishment which was accompanied by famine, pestilence, and death. After that, throughout the centuries, natural calamities have been and will be used by God to punish the earth until the sixth seal. </p>
<p data-content-id="rFrCGjzy0s3seaoP5ZFz1WE5eAMBA8Jn7QPczLYQpR6KGf-mSZlvxLAT6G-4WlYEl"> At the time of the sixth seal, the calamities will be changed from natural calamities to supernatural ones. The earth will be shaken, and the sun, moon, and stars will be damaged. These calamities will be a preface to the seventh seal. When the seventh seal is executed, the situation will be terrible and no one will be able to bear it. Shortly after the opening of the seventh seal, the first trumpet will be sounded, and “the third part of the earth” will be burnt up (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106312" data-verses="Revelation 8:7">8:7</span>). At the sounding of the second trumpet, “the third part of the sea” will become blood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106313" data-verses="Revelation 8:8">8:8</span>). At the sounding of the third trumpet, a great star will fall upon “the third part of the rivers and upon the springs of waters” and “the third part of the waters” will become wormwood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106314" data-verses="Revelation 8:10-11">8:10-11</span>). At the sounding of the fourth trumpet, “the third part of the sun and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars” will be smitten “so that the third part of them might be darkened” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106315" data-verses="Revelation 8:12">8:12</span>). God made the earth for man to live on. The sun, moon, and stars all help to maintain life on earth. But because the dwellers on earth have been so insolent <span class="pg" data-page-id="253" id="253">[253]</span> toward Him for centuries, the time will come when God will no longer endure it. He will come in to judge the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun, moon, and stars. The earth is for human existence, and every form of life on earth is for man’s benefit. The animals, vegetables, and minerals are all for the existence of mankind. These did not come into being by accident, but were planned and created by God. For example, there is no air on the moon, but there is air on earth. Around the globe is a layer of air which the Bible calls the firmament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106316" data-verses="Genesis 1:7">Gen. 1:7</span>). The earth is the planet with a firmament. God created it in such a way so that it would produce the supplies for maintaining human life. The air, sunshine, and water are all necessary for man’s existence. But after God judges the earth and heaven, the earth will no longer be a suitable place for man to live on. </p>
<p data-content-id="dqTRyG6GA884EmjvR4UyOegfPIxGdZtc9pTPOwHALeZwBCUtG7wCY77G5UKUOOnaQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106317" data-verses="Matthew 24:6-7">Matthew 24:6 and 7</span> the Lord prophesied that two kinds of wars would come—wars of people against people and wars of nation against nation, that is, civil wars and international wars. After Christ’s ascension, these wars began to take place. The Lord also prophesied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106318" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">Matthew 24</span> that there would be “earthquakes in various places” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106319" data-verses="Matthew 24:7">v. 7</span>). A recent article said that each year there will be approximately five to six thousand earthquakes ranging from two to eight on the Richter scale. This is the fulfillment of the Lord’s prophecy. In His prophecy the Lord seemed to be saying, “Don’t live on this earth so complacently, not caring for God’s purpose. You must realize that God has a purpose on this earth and that you must turn to Him for the fulfillment of His purpose.” God will warn people again and again with wars and earthquakes until the time of the fifth seal when the martyred souls can no longer tolerate the situation. The martyred saints will then cry out, saying, “How long, O sovereign Lord, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106320" data-verses="Revelation 6:10">6:10</span>). God’s answer comes in the sixth seal when the earth will be shaken and the heavenly hosts will be smitten as an introduction to and warning of the coming tribulation. The sixth <span class="pg" data-page-id="254" id="254">[254]</span> seal and the first five trumpets are closely related to one another in time. </p>
<p data-content-id="QpDUAnrDI_WRFtrr3f3Kzh9t-avEMCS3lhyUHZa2seNBxZHOZbMQUNSElYwe-H2bi"> At this juncture we need to consider the second chapter of Joel. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106321" data-verses="Joel 2:1">Joel 2</span> says that certain things will occur before the day of the Lord. If you read New Testament prophecy along with the Old Testament prophecies, you will see that there is a time called the day of the Lord. This is the great tribulation. The day of the Lord means the day of the Lord’s wrath, the day of His coming in to interfere with the world by means of supernatural calamities. The day of the Lord will be terrible. Several prophets of the Old Testament mention the day of the Lord, and they all indicate that it will be a dreadful day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106322" data-verses="Joel 1:15">Joel 1:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106323" data-verses="Joel 2:1">2:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106324" data-verses="Joel 2:11">11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106325" data-verses="Joel 2:31">31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106326" data-verses="Joel 3:14">3:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106327" data-verses="Zechariah 14:1">Zech. 14:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106328" data-verses="Malachi 4:5">Mal. 4:5</span>). The sixth seal will be before the day of the Lord, meaning that it will be before the great tribulation. The great tribulation will begin at the sounding of the fifth trumpet. The first four trumpets are the preliminary to the great tribulation. It is similar to starting an automobile. First the ignition is turned on, the motor starts, and then the car will run. In like manner, after the warning of the sixth seal, the first four trumpets will be the preliminary to the great tribulation. But, like an automobile which is warming up but has not yet moved, the four trumpets are the preparation for the great tribulation. But even these trumpets will cause severe suffering. The damage to the earth, waters, and the heavenly hosts will be greater than that caused by the earthquake of the sixth seal. From the time of the sixth seal, there will be nothing good for man on earth. </p>

However, most hymns on the worthiness of the Lamb praise Christ for being worthy because of His redemption. It is difficult to find a hymn on the Lord’s worthiness that goes beyond redemption. It is absolutely scriptural to say that the Lamb is worthy because He has redeemed and purchased us. However, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106415" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">Revelation 5</span>, the worthiness of the Lamb is not mainly due to His redemption, but to His being able to open the secret of God’s economy. Christ is worthy to open the seals of God’s economy because He has defeated the enemy and has redeemed us. As the One who has brought God’s authority to the earth, He is the victorious, overcoming Lion of the tribe of Judah and the Lamb who has accomplished a full redemption for God’s chosen people. Therefore, He is completely qualified and positioned to open the mystery of God’s economy. This is one of the crucial points in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106416" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">Revelation chapter five</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="38DbLjkjfrpGOnLvrDZzvLBGxmEAB03T0zpiuZ_ALgyZ1yVY5W1UVpbk1LrYnnGZ3">THE SEVEN EYES, THE SEVEN LAMPS,<br/>AND THE SEVEN SPIRITS</h2><p data-content-id="GYIVpUWkuZmHSrN-tf6YUfoxo7P637W-OL81T49tkhetZaHINSoSt6T3Ue9-usg-C"> Another major point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106417" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">Revelation 5</span> is that Christ as the Lion-Lamb has “seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106418" data-verses="Revelation 5:6">v. 6</span>). These seven eyes are also the seven lamps burning before the throne of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106419" data-verses="Revelation 4:5">4:5</span>). Hence, in these chapters we have the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits. Revelation is the only book in the Bible that mentions the seven Spirits. But here we see that these seven <span class="pg" data-page-id="266" id="266">[266]</span> Spirits are the seven eyes of Christ, and that the seven eyes of Christ are the seven lamps before the throne of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="cgfMaJYFAO1mOpI22kRdhJ3KYa1LSGwHK7fr4_AyvD4ITdSSCh7v-cnqPDc7CCaPG"> The first mention of the seven lamps is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106420" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span>, where we see seven lamps on the one lampstand. But if we only had <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106421" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span>, we would not know the meaning of the lampstand and its seven lamps. According to our human understanding, we would simply say that the seven lamps are for the intensification of the light. Although this is both right and logical, the significance of the seven lamps is much deeper than this. Why did the lampstand not have six or eight lamps? In Zechariah we see something further regarding the seven lamps, for in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106422" data-verses="Zechariah 3:1-2">Zechariah 3 and 4</span> we see that the seven lamps are the seven eyes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106423" data-verses="Zechariah 3:9">Zech. 3:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106424" data-verses="Zechariah 4:2">4:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106425" data-verses="Zechariah 4:10">10</span>). Although <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106426" data-verses="Zechariah 4:10">Zechariah 4:10</span> speaks of the seven eyes of the Lord, the connection between the eyes, the lamps, and the Spirit is not made clear. Thus, we need to proceed further to the book of Revelation, where we see the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits. We need to see the progression from Exodus through Zechariah to Revelation. In Exodus we have the seven lamps, in Zechariah we have the seven eyes, and in Revelation we have the seven Spirits. In Exodus the seven lamps are mentioned, but nothing is said of the eyes or of the Spirits. In Zechariah we have the seven lamps and the seven eyes with an obscure mention of the Spirit. But in Revelation we have the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits. </p>
<p data-content-id="Yf-rmGLmzs8DVJKAZqsHcn6KkA6m-eQpwCL8YYxWWYsYffHyYsR_Jf62ch9moi03S"> As we pointed out in message eight, the lampstand is a symbol of the Triune God. The gold symbolizes the divine substance of the Father; the stand, which is the embodiment of the gold, symbolizes Christ as the embodiment of the Father; and the seven lamps symbolize the Spirit as the expression of Christ who is the embodiment of the Father. Therefore, we have the Father (the gold) as the substance, the Son (the stand) as the embodiment, and the Spirit (the lamps) as the expression. We have the substance, the embodiment, and the expression. In Exodus we cannot see that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God. We must go on to Zechariah and eventually to Revelation before we <span class="pg" data-page-id="267" id="267">[267]</span> can see this. As a recovery of divine revelation, this is absolutely new. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="EquHWEovemLQ65DjOF9kgzpp4sCOMkesiQtpIkUhAc0HmLnNxgDapPV_nZlY4Z7aR">GOD’S BUILDING</h2><p data-content-id="1bH1BoKDaRAJxyi_xbCD4VJbRgzC27bryd7u8eD4YJle8aJWRrCBJAh3feyA9YqSH"> The lamps in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106427" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span> are for the building up of the tabernacle, especially for the move in the tabernacle. Without light, it is impossible to move. The light is for the move, and the move is for God’s building. The seven lamps, therefore, are for the building up of the tabernacle, God’s dwelling place on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="9rVdP9OOQSCrvWwNpNEghXtITe_MUbnsp2Q1i322XjDbKlbCI5SwCkdRWdaVi_g0k"> The seven lamps in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106428" data-verses="Zechariah 3:1-2">Zechariah 3 and 4</span> are for the recovery of God’s building. The principle is the same in the rebuilding of the temple as it was in the building of the tabernacle. The same is true of the book of Revelation. If we approach this book with a shortsighted view, we shall be unable to see that the seven Spirits, which are the seven eyes of the Lamb and the seven lamps before God’s throne, are for God’s building. But if we have an overall view, we shall see that the seven Spirits are absolutely for God’s building. Revelation begins with the seven local churches and it ends with the New Jerusalem. Although this book contains the judgment of God, this judgment is not the goal. Judgment is not for judgment; it is for God’s building. The New Jerusalem, God’s eternal dwelling place, issues out of this judgment. Thus, the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits are all for God’s building. We are here for the realization of God’s eternal goal in His divine building. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jA4s3Ofm8UagYZF7i1Vjw0XMpK2abysDNDcRyxqadYigZpP5BmO3xTrtY6N7RJdCR">THE SEVEN EYES FOR GOD’S BUILDING</h2><p data-content-id="Te69zzil3D0-mAl8PfN896MAEROo9Kaxc7b0VET_-Yefo8dz0ktoThHUcteAt6Rr5"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106429" data-verses="Zechariah 3:9">Zechariah 3:9</span> says, “For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.” This verse reveals that the seven eyes are not only the seven eyes of the Lord, but also the seven eyes of the stone. This stone was engraved in one day for the iniquity of God’s people. The engraving of the stone was its being dealt with by God’s righteousness on the cross for our redemption. Christ, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="268" id="268">[268]</span> redeeming Lamb, is also the stone on which are the seven eyes. These seven eyes are the seven lamps for God’s building. When we come to the book of Revelation, we see very clearly that the seven lamps are the seven eyes of the Redeemer, and that the seven eyes of the Redeemer are the seven Spirits of God for the building of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="nvHEdQi38H-SlLL6P9OfVCFAsnx21wnv2jZt6ZG6aLbP35LOw849ym4uqoStVA0ft"> According to the book of Revelation, the Lord Jesus has seven burning eyes. Although these eyes are for searching, judging, refining, and enlightening, they are ultimately for transfusing us with His essence, His divine element. How can the Lord’s divine essence be wrought into our being? By the transfusing of His seven eyes. Whenever we are searched, purged, purified, refined, and judged by the flaming eyes of Christ, we gain something of Him. Not only is some element of ourselves purified, but some element of Him is transfused into us. The natural things are purged, and the divine things are transfused into us. Through this process, the Lord builds us together and carries out God’s building. The book of Revelation is not mainly for searching and judging; it is for producing and building up the New Jerusalem, the ultimate issue of this book. As a result of the transfusing of the seven eyes of Christ, the New Jerusalem will be built up. The seven eyes of Christ look at God’s chosen people, enlightening, searching, judging, purifying, and refining them, and ultimately infusing them with whatever He is. By infusing us with His essence, He makes us the same as He is and, by so doing, He transforms us from being natural into being the same as He. Then we become the transformed material for the building up of the New Jerusalem. We all must see that the seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God and of the Lamb, are absolutely for God’s building. </p>

In this chapter we have the opening of the seventh seal (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106442" data-verses="Revelation 8:1-2">vv. 1-2</span>), the scene in heaven after the opening of the seventh seal (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106443" data-verses="Revelation 8:3-5">vv. 3-5</span>), and the sounding of the first four trumpets (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106444" data-verses="Revelation 8:6-12">vv. 6-12</span>). </p>

THE SEVENTH SEAL</h2><p data-content-id="tICK0kqpdw83viGh_xTywHd_bphXoEog1o4YjOZhdjbM1vmCFYdIuEXfD_WST4Dgf"> The seventh seal, which will begin before the great tribulation, consists of the seven trumpets, for the seven trumpets are the content of the seventh seal. If we would understand the prophecy of this book, we must realize that the secret of God’s economy is sealed with seven seals. As we have pointed out, the scroll in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106445" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">chapter five</span> is the new testament enacted by Christ with His precious blood. This new testament is the scroll of God’s economy sealed with seven seals which are the contents of the scroll. We have seen that the first four seals are not consecutive but simultaneous and that the fifth and sixth seals are consecutive. The seventh seal includes everything from after the sixth seal to eternity future. Thus, the seventh seal, consisting of the seven trumpets, is all-inclusive. As we shall see, the seven bowls are a part of the seventh trumpet. The seventh seal consists of the seven trumpets, and the seventh trumpet consists, in part, of the seven bowls. Both the seventh seal and the seven trumpets run to eternity. The seventh trumpet will close this age <span class="pg" data-page-id="276" id="276">[276]</span> and usher in the kingdom, the new heaven, and the new earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="hhHSRpGa6c8nmBYQbhmi3QAUBQYvp73v3LkGuqyF8VwAmEhhWitCawAl83I6gzdpk"> Some may have the concept that the seven trumpets follow the seven seals and that the seven bowls succeed the seven trumpets. This concept is natural. In understanding the Word, we should have no trust in our natural concepts. Rather, we must forsake them and come to the Lord, saying, “Lord, show us Your way.” Since 1933, I have been helped by Brother Nee’s study on the book of Revelation. Due to the natural concept which was deeply embedded in my thinking, I believed that the seven trumpets were the continuation of the seven seals and that the seven bowls followed the seven trumpets. This concept constantly troubled me. I studied and studied until one day the light came and I saw that the seventh seal contains the seven trumpets. The seven trumpets are the equivalent of the seventh seal. They actually are the seventh seal. The content of the first four seals is the four horses, the content of the fifth seal is the cry of the martyred saints, the content of the sixth seal is God’s answer to the cry of the martyred saints, and a warning to the dwellers on the earth, and the content of the seventh seal is the seven trumpets. </p>
<p data-content-id="UbDmKnrbR6wkXMKUDOIMD2P-iCmyCslZE9lFaopaqfOk7Tikcu1gMU62N3Lsd0fR0"> Like the first four seals, the first four trumpets, which are not yet the direct judgment on men, form one group. The first trumpet consists of a judgment on the earth with the trees and all the grass, as occurred in Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106446" data-verses="Exodus 9:18-25">Exo. 9:18-25</span>); the second, a judgment on the sea with the living creatures and ships; the third, a judgment on the rivers and springs of waters, as occurred in Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106447" data-verses="Exodus 7:17-21">Exo. 7:17-21</span>); the fourth, a judgment on the sun, the moon, and the stars, to darken them, as also occurred in Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106448" data-verses="Exodus 10:21-23">Exo. 10:21-23</span>). By the judgments of these four trumpets, the third part of the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the hosts in the heavens are damaged, thus causing them to be no longer good for man’s living. Before the seven trumpets, there will already have been a judgment on the earth and on the hosts of the heavens at the sixth seal (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106449" data-verses="Revelation 6:12-14">6:12-14</span>). The extent of the damage of that judgment will not be as definite as the damage of the first four <span class="pg" data-page-id="277" id="277">[277]</span> trumpets. At the fifth trumpet Satan and Antichrist will collaborate to torment men; at the sixth trumpet there will be a further judgment on men as the two hundred million cavalry kill the third part of men; and at the seventh trumpet there will be many things—the eternal kingdom of Christ, the third woe comprising the seven bowls, the judgment of the dead, the giving of reward to the prophets, to the saints, and to the Godfearing people, and the destruction of the destroyers of the earth. At the seventh trumpet, there will be further judgments on the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun through the seven bowls (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106450" data-verses="Revelation 16:1-21">16:1-21</span>). These will be the most severe judgments of God upon the earth and heaven. </p>
<p data-content-id="MfMdlEkgq-a1uKaUUALpAADpEciSs1TRfcVofpiZYMm5RgH8fZWaM9MIilSy8MI87"> We must forsake the concept that the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls are consecutive. No, to repeat, the seven trumpets are the content of the seventh seal, and the seven bowls are a part of the seventh trumpet. This is the key to understanding the prophecy of this book. Only God could have written the book of Revelation because only He has the wisdom to compose it in such a marvelous way. Who else has the wisdom to write a book with such signs and symbols as that of the four horses which fully cover the history of the past twenty centuries? That the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls are not consecutive reveals God’s wisdom in writing this book. If we do not have the light to see this arrangement, although we may read Revelation again and again, we shall still be confused. </p>

This silence <span class="pg" data-page-id="278" id="278">[278]</span> indicates solemnity. At the opening of the seventh seal, all heaven becomes silent because the age is about to be changed. The period before the opening of the seventh seal was the age of God’s toleration. For the sake of His purpose of preaching the gospel to produce the churches to fulfill His eternal plan, God has been tolerating the sinful situation on earth. But with the opening of the seventh seal, the age of toleration is terminated and another age is brought in. This is the age of God’s wrath. God is now coming in to intervene in the rebellious and sinful situation on earth. Because this occasion is so solemn, heaven becomes silent, an indication that something serious is about to take place. </p>

<p data-content-id="KieXqJ7jgoER4UdfBfZNeFTK2j3-sOhh6wo2bjONxSaxFCktk5VChNS7qxKtiNlUj"> In the midst of this solemn scene, another Angel appears (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106453" data-verses="Revelation 8:3">v. 3</span>). This angel is Christ. When Christ was revealed as walking in the midst of the churches, He was revealed as the Son of Man, and when He spoke to the churches, He declared all His qualifications. But in the administration of God’s judgment upon the earth, Christ is the Angel standing on the position of One who has been sent by God. In a very positive sense, Christ is everything; He is whatever the economy of God needs. Revelation specifically describes Christ as “another Angel,” indicating that He is not a regular or common angel but a special Angel. As we pointed out in message twenty-one, in the Old Testament Christ was called the “Angel of the Lord,” who was God Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106454" data-verses="Genesis 22:11-12">Gen. 22:11-12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106455" data-verses="Exodus 3:2-6">Exo. 3:2-6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106456" data-verses="Judges 6:11-24">Judg. 6:11-24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106457" data-verses="Zechariah 1:11-12">Zech. 1:11-12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106458" data-verses="Zechariah 2:8-11">2:8-11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106459" data-verses="Zechariah 3:1-7">3:1-7</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106460" data-verses="Genesis 22:1">Genesis 22</span> the Angel of the Lord spoke to Abraham, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106461" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span> the Angel of the Lord appeared to Moses. Christ is another Angel; He is the unique, special Angel. </p>

The golden censer signifies the prayer of the saints, which is brought to God by Christ as the other Angel. The incense signifies Christ with all His merit to be added to the prayers of the saints that the saints’ prayers might be acceptable to God upon the golden altar. At the opening of the seventh seal there will still be “saints” praying on the earth. </p>

THE BEGINNING OF THE GREAT TRIBULATION</h2><p data-content-id="nvHEdQi38H-SlLL6P9OfVCFAsmR2yjHv2jZt6ZG6aLbP35LOw849ym4uqoStVA0ft"> Many Christians think that the great tribulation will last seven years. Some believe this because they understand the Bible in a careless and traditional way. But the word of the Bible is very accurate, and we must understand it in the way of being enlightened. No word in the Bible is wasted; every word is meaningful and accurate. </p>
<p data-content-id="6gUudY5_FgkP0IWCRfIYS9bkriQOqC5MuZnMLKGfCY9m8DxWQTymsdYcJHe9YM_1B"> Let us now consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106491" data-verses="Daniel 9:24-27">Daniel 9:24-27</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106492" data-verses="Daniel 9:24">Verse 24</span> says, “Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.” The people mentioned here are Daniel’s people and the holy city refers to Jerusalem. According to the Bible, a week here does not mean seven days but seven years. If you say that the seventy <span class="pg" data-page-id="286" id="286">[286]</span> weeks refer to seventy periods of seven days, you will never have the proper interpretation of this passage. </p>
<p data-content-id="RcLtLXvO2x49e5HSqeDCRKXOwVcf52QDyI7Yq7O3GLi69XubFEtTV_iN6b9MI_Z-a"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106493" data-verses="Daniel 9:25">Verse 25</span> says, “Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.” Here we see “seven weeks” and then “threescore and two weeks.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106494" data-verses="Daniel 9:26">Verse 26</span> continues, “And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.” The reference to Messiah’s being “cut off” points to Christ’s being crucified on the cross. The destruction of the city and the sanctuary refers to the destruction of the temple and of the city of Jerusalem under Titus in A.D. 70. </p>
<p data-content-id="sgITvoUbLp9kr7so-lifik0UFiyc33maWiA8xIiSnO6y-U0RpWzmI90zjb8ycRLz9"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106495" data-verses="Daniel 9:27">Verse 27</span> concludes, saying, “And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.” Here we see that the prince will confirm the covenant for one week and that in the midst of the week, that is, after three and one-half years, he will cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease. This means that he will discontinue the worship of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="w61C8Sf0pRjO1CqIL2kXUnSo6vpG3UbXzFDh5Au7smcx1nKys-XlikrZOIVeRdjoV"> These seventy weeks constitute four hundred ninety years beginning from the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, who issued the decree to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106496" data-verses="Nehemiah 1:1">Neh. 1:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106497" data-verses="Nehemiah 2:1">2:1</span>). The first seven weeks, forty-nine years, were for the finishing of the rebuilding of the street and wall of Jerusalem. From then until Christ was “cut off” were sixty-two weeks, four hundred thirty-four years. Since the end of the sixty-nine weeks, there has been a long period of suspension. Eventually, the time of the last week, the last seven years, will come. This is the source of the thought that the great tribulation will last seven years. <span class="pg" data-page-id="287" id="287">[287]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="LT7GHt_97QehEFI0vw7uvsMOrnvI-77JAK6-4yadHVCpNEmCwmz8MPsIjIZIRoY7N"> As we shall now see, this concept is not accurate. The last seven years, the last week, will be the time when Antichrist will make an agreement with the Jewish people. During the first half of these seven years, Antichrist will be friendly to the Jews. But after three and one-half years, he will change his mind. Although he formerly agreed that the Jews could worship God in the temple by offering the sacrifices, he will change his mind, set himself up as God, erect an image of himself in the temple, and force people to worship him and his image. Then he will begin to mistreat the Jews. Thus, the first half of the seven years will not be a time of tribulation, for during that time Antichrist will be friendly to the Jews. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106498" data-verses="Daniel 9:27">Daniel 9:27</span>, “in the midst of the week” Antichrist “shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease,” commanding the Jews to cease worshipping God and offering sacrifices to Him. Antichrist will also erect the abomination of desolation in the Holy Place. According to Revelation, the abomination of desolation will be the image of Antichrist set up as an idol in the temple. </p>
<p data-content-id="mQZCaUskgKXnWQwz5-GjAk8StQdCbWcUewFvjwcuYXvkPdWSc6wkDFGa6M3STyygs"> Let us now turn to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106499" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">Matthew 24</span>, a chapter which covers this matter of the great tribulation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106500" data-verses="Matthew 24:15">verse 15</span> the Lord Jesus said, “When therefore you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place.” When will this be? It will not be in the beginning of the seven years but in the middle of the seven years, at the time when Antichrist will discontinue the worship of God, set himself up as God, and put his image in the temple, which, in the eyes of God, is the abomination. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106501" data-verses="Matthew 24:21">verse 21</span> the Lord predicted, “For then there shall be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall be.” By this we see that the great tribulation, which begins in the middle of the last seven years, will be only three and one-half years long. The traditional teaching that it will be seven years long is inexact, and we should not follow it. It does not provide the proper details for the study of prophecy. Those who hold the traditional teachings speak of the seven years, neglecting that it is in the midst of the seven years that Antichrist will <span class="pg" data-page-id="288" id="288">[288]</span> change his mind and that this will bring in the great tribulation lasting three and one-half years, the second half of the final week. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZwRw-sIjrvKZJVrX9K-LjtjuWgm2RhQTTWw_AihsrUNSru4xxjkdO4VC6khkUMgY3"> We also need to consider some verses from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106502" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106503" data-verses="Revelation 12:5-6">Verses 5 and 6</span> say, “And she brought forth a son, a man-child who was about to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, so that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.” The one thousand two hundred and sixty days are the equivalent of three and one-half years. After the man-child is raptured, there will be a period of three and one-half years, the last half of the seventieth week, the time during which the image of Antichrist will be set up in the temple. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106504" data-verses="Revelation 12:7-13">verses 7 through 13</span> reveal that there will be war in heaven, that the dragon and his angels will be cast out of heaven to the earth, and that the dragon will persecute the woman who brought forth the man-child. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106505" data-verses="Revelation 12:14">Verse 14</span> says, “And the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman that she might fly into the wilderness into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time from the face of the serpent.” This “time, and times, and half a time” refers to the final three and one-half years. In this portion of the Word we see that Satan will be cast down from heaven to earth at the beginning of the last half of the seven years. This also proves that, strictly speaking, the great tribulation will last three and one-half years and not seven years. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106554" data-verses="Revelation 1:19">1:19</span> the Lord said to John, “Write therefore the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which are about to take place after these things.” Thus, these three main sections are “the things seen” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106555" data-verses="Revelation 1:9-20">1:9-20</span>), “the things present” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106556" data-verses="Revelation 2:1">2:1—3:22</span>), and “the things to come” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106557" data-verses="Revelation 4:1">4:1—22:5</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106558" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">chapter one</span>, there are the seven golden lampstands with Christ in their midst, which are “the things seen,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106559" data-verses="Revelation 2:1">chapters two and three</span> there are the seven churches, which are “the things present.” The section on “the things to come” begins with the scene in heaven in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106560" data-verses="Revelation 4:1">chapter four</span>. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106561" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">chapter five</span> reveals, Christ comes into this scene as the unique One worthy to open the secret of God’s economy. As we have pointed out, the first four seals give a brief history of the world from Christ’s ascension until His coming back, portraying it as a four-horse race. Near to the end of this age, at the time of the fifth seal, the martyred saints will cry to God. The sixth seal will be God’s answer to their cry. He will shake the universe as a warning to those who dwell on the earth and as an introduction to the coming great tribulation. Following this, the seven trumpets will come in as the content of the seventh seal. The first four trumpets will be God’s judgment upon the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the heavenly host. Due to this judgment, the earth will no longer be a suitable place for man to dwell. Because the calamities of the sixth seal and the first four trumpets do not directly injure man, but only damage the earth, making it no longer suitable for man to live in, they <span class="pg" data-page-id="296" id="296">[296]</span> are not a part of the great tribulation. As we pointed out in the last message, the fifth trumpet marks the beginning of the great tribulation. The great tribulation mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106562" data-verses="Matthew 24:21">Matthew 24:21</span> is composed of the three woes of the fifth, sixth, and seventh trumpets. </p>
<p data-content-id="FrpbcRt3yRk0Uxjm1URW7Eg09gWMmO4pTrxPj1VjX3CdPg4WUZDe1ebWLRh8zhLuo"> In the fifth trumpet mankind will be directly tormented. At the sounding of the fifth trumpet, Satan will come down from heaven to earth and Antichrist will come up from the abyss, and together they will cause men to be tormented for five months. Unlike the foregoing calamities, the torment of the demon-possessed locusts will directly touch man’s being. As we have seen, at the beginning of the last three and one-half years, Antichrist will change his mind about the Israelites, will discontinue the worship of God, and will torment the man created by God for Himself. This will be the beginning of the great tribulation. This torment, as the first woe, will be so severe that no one will be able to bear it. Following this, there will be the second woe, which is the sixth trumpet. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Cs3ONxeMth5mwllbyYf4lOgkPyl9pIDV8RSd8O8Hqv0o7uTpEdoOJ6dbZT0nyJr-e">I. THE LOOSING OF THE FOUR ANGELS</h2><p data-content-id="P8jMkwpkLdBOj0p4O-2xBwjyJX0f21sfuCHBwhorQzQcIaMpTU1ljj4-xfrJokpi-"> The second woe is more complicated than the first. It is not as clear cut as the woe of the fifth trumpet, which is caused by the collaboration of Satan and Antichrist. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106563" data-verses="Revelation 9:13-14">Revelation 9:13 and 14</span> say, “And the sixth angel trumpeted, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound at the great river Euphrates.” The blood of the atonement was put upon the four horns of the golden altar, the incense altar, for atonement, that is, for redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106564" data-verses="Leviticus 16:18">Lev. 16:18</span>). The voice which comes “out of the four horns of the golden altar” indicates that God’s judgment upon man is based on the redemption of Christ; it is because men do not believe in Christ’s redemption that God sends His judgment. </p>

The second woe of the sixth trumpet and the third woe of the seventh trumpet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106573" data-verses="Revelation 8:13">8:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106574" data-verses="Revelation 9:12">9:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106575" data-verses="Revelation 11:14">11:14</span>) must also be parts of the great tribulation, which, probably with the damage caused by the sixth seal and the first four trumpets, will be the trial on all the earth’s dwellers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106576" data-verses="Revelation 3:10">3:10</span>). The two woes spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106577" data-verses="Revelation 9:12">verse 12</span> are the sixth and seventh trumpets (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106578" data-verses="Revelation 9:13-20">9:13-20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106579" data-verses="Revelation 11:14-15">11:14-15</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="p1fZ6JpTsfZKO6kKI7TE51_R6W79tFaPuaeKh7AA1i31cpyLjD9mnBPgq5VXps5uw"> Undoubtedly, the four angels “which are bound at the great river Euphrates” are four evil, fallen, rebellious angels who followed Satan. The Bible does not indicate how long they have been bound there. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106580" data-verses="Revelation 9:15">Verse 15</span> says, “And the four angels were loosed who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they might kill the third part of men.” Many understand this word according to their natural concept, thinking that “the hour and day and month and year” refer to the specific year, month, day, and hour when the killing of the third part of men will take place. But this is not the meaning. “For the hour and day and month and year” means that the four angels have been prepared unto the hour, plus the day, plus the month, plus the year—altogether thirteen months, one day, and one hour—for the killing of men. The killing will firstly last one hour, then one day, then one month, and then one year. It will be so severe and terrifying that, firstly, people will not expect it to last more than an hour. When, after an hour, it has not ended, they will expect it to last only for a day. After that, they will expect that surely it will not be prolonged more than a month. After a month transpires, then people will think that it could only continue for a year. Altogether, the time of this <span class="pg" data-page-id="298" id="298">[298]</span> horrible killing will be thirteen months, one day, and one hour. </p>
<p data-content-id="OPc0C_l9lbNcoMQBRuTefKizIoZFY1ZNF3gAaE0-NZcyLxO2KT0pWsR4uiaTts0_i"> During World War II many of us suffered. When that war broke out on July 7, 1937, I was traveling in China. The next morning I read an express edition of the newspaper which said that war had broken out the previous night. From that time on, we began to suffer the war, firstly for four years. Then came the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the United States entered the war. As our suffering continued, we expected the war to end at any time. The news came again and again that after a certain period of time the war would probably end, but it still dragged on and we kept counting the days. During the war, I was imprisoned by the invading army for thirty days. As I suffered there in prison, I not only counted the days but also the hours, expecting surely that the next hour would see my release. After thirty days I was released, but I still had no freedom, and we continued to count the days. From this experience we can understand the meaning of “the hour and day and month and year” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106581" data-verses="Revelation 9:15">9:15</span>. When the dreadful killing mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106582" data-verses="Revelation 9:1">chapter nine</span> comes upon man, people will expect the slaughter to cease in an hour, then in a day, then in a month, and then in a year. The four angels that are bound by the river Euphrates are prepared to kill man for such a long period of time—for an hour, a day, a month, and a year. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="udGqnkRQe0Fa75Rq062nBbUbAMOCtu5uLLQkayoHbSEK216rHpUxhj5eVqRJadTMc">CHRIST COMING TO TAKE POSSESSION<br/>OF THE EARTH</h1><p data-content-id="fGUGkn5to2I5UFoKv1VNdQtvldRToWpfFL58bNBasS6Otne5-f2c6FWgAyNaUaldn"> In the past several messages we have been considering the content of the seven seals. In the book of Revelation, the number seven is composed two ways: four plus three and six plus one. Both the seven seals and the seven trumpets are composed this way. With the number seven there is addition but no multiplication. The number twelve, however, is the product of three times four. The seven seals mean that in God’s complete move His creatures will be brought to the Triune God. God’s creature—man—will also be brought to the unique God. Thus, the seven seals indicate God’s complete move. The seven seals, which are God’s complete move on the earth and in the universe, are the content of God’s economy. The purpose of God’s move is to bring His creatures, signified by the number four, to the Triune God, and to bring man, signified by the number six (man was created on the sixth day), to the unique God. The seven seals actually bring God’s creation to Himself. The fall of man, which was caused by Satan, has kept man from God. While the fall was a subtraction, God’s economy today is an addition. The fall caused man to go away from the unique God, but God’s economy and His move bring man back to Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="ITBVDgsapCA5h0Ba51FA5D5vm5qu7jamvrF7YxN5-1GluETQyeBTiS_tmIqIxEe99"> Many Christians do not understand the matters pertaining to the sixth seal and the first four trumpets. The sixth seal and the first four trumpets of the seventh seal are mainly concerned with the shaking and the judgment of the earth and the heavenly host. As a result of this shaking and judgment, the earth will no longer be a suitable place for man to live in peacefully. The sixth seal and the first five trumpets are closely related to one another in time, for there <span class="pg" data-page-id="306" id="306">[306]</span> is not much of an interval between them. Some, counting from the time of the first horse, say that the great tribulation will last seven years. Those who do have not seen that Revelation covers the whole history of mankind since Christ’s ascension. Their interpretation leaves a great gap between the ascension of Christ and the end time. To have such a gap, approximately two thousand years in length, is altogether illogical according to the Lord’s prophecy, because it was in the first century that He prophesied of the things to come (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106618" data-verses="Revelation 1:19">1:19</span>). Furthermore, the scroll in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106619" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">chapter five</span> is a full revelation of God’s economy. As such, it must include the preaching of the gospel. The preaching of the gospel for the producing of the church is a great item in God’s economy. Because it is illogical for there to be such a great gap in this book, we believe that the four horses of the first four seals are an outline of human history from Christ’s ascension until the end of this age. </p>
<p data-content-id="Huy9VfbmqOU-Xs8Ud1qttbqEcpo2k5i36RmXphwWDhi5Es85PdREqM_9KTAokR4Qe"> By careful study we have also seen that the last seven years will probably not begin with the time of the sixth seal, because the period from the sixth seal until the fifth trumpet, which is the beginning of the great tribulation, will be a very short time. It will not be three and one-half years. The great tribulation will last three and one-half years, the second half of the last seven years. If you count the last seven years from the sixth seal, then the time from the sixth seal to the fifth trumpet must be at least three and one-half years. Logically speaking, this is too long. Between the sixth seal and the fifth trumpet there will be four trumpets, the judgments on the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the heavenly hosts. Although it is less severe, the sixth seal, which will be the shaking of the earth and the damaging of the heavenly host, is the same in principle as that of the first four trumpets. </p>
<p data-content-id="Xi707fcPG3tgdRrB8u8nSWR79m-qSB6y3SAVJIWn_neLMO9oHqhEzON_RcU2wxzw1"> The sixth seal and the first four trumpets are an introduction, a preliminary, to the great tribulation. In none of these calamities will God directly touch man. This will not occur until the torment of the woe of the fifth trumpet and the slaughter by the two hundred million cavalry troops <span class="pg" data-page-id="307" id="307">[307]</span> of the woe of the sixth trumpet. After the woe of the sixth trumpet, there will be the seven bowls as the last woe and as a part of the content of the seventh trumpet. The sixth bowl, which is related to the sixth trumpet, will be for the gathering for war at Armageddon. That war will be the great winepress of the fury of God trodden by the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106620" data-verses="Revelation 14:19-20">14:19-20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106621" data-verses="Revelation 19:15">19:15</span>) when He comes down to earth to fight against Antichrist and to cast him into the lake of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106622" data-verses="Revelation 19:11-21">19:11-21</span>). This should be at the same time the seventh bowl will be poured out upon the air to bring in the greatest earthquake and the greatest hail which will be the last plague and the end of the great tribulation. </p>
<p data-content-id="kJtprzMv-iEybgkzNyzDTDV_G53Z-pPsrUhhtuCMESGHnnFsJwP3wtj5eeGMBki0p"> In this message, we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106623" data-verses="Revelation 10:1-11">10:1-11</span>, an insertion between the sixth and seventh trumpets. If we would understand the book of Revelation, we must know which sections are continuations and which are insertions. When we were on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106624" data-verses="Revelation 7:1">chapter seven</span>, we pointed out that it is an insertion between the sixth and seventh seals, showing God’s preservation of His people. That chapter shows the vision of the marking of the remnant of Israel and the vision of the rapture of God’s redeemed ones. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106625" data-verses="Revelation 10:1">Chapter ten</span> is part of an insertion between the sixth and seventh trumpets. This insertion is composed of three visions: the vision of Christ coming to take possession of the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106626" data-verses="Revelation 10:1-7">10:1-7</span>), the vision of the treading of the earthly Jerusalem by Antichrist and his armies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106627" data-verses="Revelation 11:1-2">11:1-2</span>), and the vision of the two witnesses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106628" data-verses="Revelation 11:3-12">11:3-12</span>). </p>

In this portion of the Word we have a clear vision of Christ coming to take possession of the earth. In this chapter Christ is “another strong Angel,” like the One in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106650" data-verses="Revelation 7:2">7:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106651" data-verses="Revelation 8:3">8:3</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106652" data-verses="Revelation 18:1">18:1</span>. </p>

To be “on the cloud” is to come openly, whereas to be “clothed with a cloud” is to come secretly. This indicates that even after the sixth trumpet, which will be in the midst of the great tribulation, Christ will still be coming secretly, not openly, until He will be seen by all the tribes of the earth, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106658" data-verses="Revelation 1:7">1:7</span> and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106659" data-verses="Matthew 24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>. By the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106660" data-verses="Revelation 10:1">chapter ten</span>, Christ’s coming is still secret.

He will be wrapped in the cloud until <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106662" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>, when He will sit on the cloud and His coming will become public. By this we see that the general teaching that Christ will come before the great tribulation is inaccurate. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106719" data-verses="Revelation 10:1">chapter ten</span> we have a clear vision of Christ coming back to take possession of the earth. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106720" data-verses="Revelation 11:1">chapter eleven</span> we have a vision crucial to the prophecy of this book. As we consider this vision, three main items must be kept in mind: the time, the place, and the people. The length of time covered in this vision is forty-two months (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106721" data-verses="Revelation 11:2">v. 2</span>). These forty-two months are twelve hundred and sixty days (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106722" data-verses="Revelation 11:3">v. 3</span>). Undoubtedly, this is a reference to the verses in the book of Daniel where there is mention of the three and a half years, the second half of the last of the seventy weeks (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106723" data-verses="Daniel 12:7">Dan. 12:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106724" data-verses="Daniel 7:26">7:26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106725" data-verses="Daniel 9:27">9:27</span>). In Revelation we have the fulfillment of what is mentioned in Daniel. The place in this vision is the city of Jerusalem, which, according to the book of Daniel, will be given over to the Gentiles, mainly to Antichrist. When Antichrist breaks the agreement made with Israel for seven years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106726" data-verses="Daniel 9:27">Dan. 9:27</span>), he will persecute the Jews and force them to discontinue the worship of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106727" data-verses="Revelation 13:7">Rev. 13:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106728" data-verses="Daniel 7:21">Dan. 7:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106729" data-verses="Daniel 8:11-12">8:11-12</span>). From the side of Antichrist, he will seize control of Jerusalem, but from God’s side, God will give Jerusalem over to him. This means God will allow Antichrist to do whatever he desires to the city of Jerusalem. </p>

As we shall see, these two witnesses will not be new people, but two who were present in Old Testament times—Moses and Elijah.

<p data-content-id="D08BEZDWCoGzl9aRgkuTZIQB0Ejk0_zSwTEtOAeTiI-pN0qDlIp5_x909EdoSb6yb"> The apostle John was told to measure the temple of God and the altar. Undoubtedly, this is the temple and altar in the heavens. This measuring indicates that the heavens will be preserved from being damaged. During these three and a half years, heaven will be preserved because Satan will be cast out of heaven and down to earth. Because the man-child will have been raptured to heaven, there will no longer be any place for Satan there. Wherever the overcomers are, there is no room for Satan. The overcomers will fight upward into heaven, and, once there, war will rage between them and Satan. Satan will be defeated and cast down to earth. Then Christ and the overcomers will fight downward to the earth until they reach Armageddon and destroy the army of Antichrist. In the last three and a half years there will be no trace of Satan in heaven, and heaven will be wholly preserved. At that time, Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet, a devilish company, will be on earth doing everything possible to corrupt it. </p>

<p data-content-id="5gvNTj0qyHK7fxM7muDqwkXAA8W1IdIvbfrgDct-kby-g5UvD45-QA3Mzygn6Yx6f"> Now we come to the testimony of the two witnesses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106763" data-verses="Revelation 11:3-12">vv. 3-12</span>). All Bible students agree that one of the two witnesses is Elijah. But there is some disagreement over the identity of the other, whether he is Enoch or Moses. Some argue in favor of Enoch because, besides Elijah, he is the only one who never died. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106764" data-verses="Hebrews 9:27">Hebrews 9:27</span>, it is appointed to man to die once. These who hold this view say that since Enoch and Elijah never died, they must be the two <span class="pg" data-page-id="318" id="318">[318]</span> witnesses who will die once during the great tribulation. Because Moses already died, he cannot die the second time. But what about Lazarus? Contrary to this way of thinking, he died, was resurrected, and then died again. Why do we say that the two witnesses are Moses and Elijah? We say this because this claim is strongly based upon the facts of the Bible. The Bible reveals that Moses and Elijah are the two witnesses of God. What they do in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106765" data-verses="Revelation 11:5-6">11:5 and 6</span> is just like the deeds of Moses and Elijah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106766" data-verses="Exodus 7:17">Exo. 7:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106767" data-verses="Exodus 7:19">19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106768" data-verses="Exodus 9:14">9:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106769" data-verses="Exodus 11:1">11:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106770" data-verses="2Kings 1:10-12">2 Kings 1:10-12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106771" data-verses="1Kings 17:1">1 Kings 17:1</span>). Moses changed water into blood, and Elijah called down fire from heaven. Therefore, according to their ministry, the two witnesses must be Moses and Elijah. Furthermore, they appeared before the Lord on the mount of transfiguration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106772" data-verses="Matthew 17:1-3">Matt. 17:1-3</span>). Moses, representing the law, and Elijah, representing the prophets (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106773" data-verses="Luke 16:16">Luke 16:16</span>), both testify for God. The Old Testament is composed with writings representative of these two men, the law and the prophets. The law was given through Moses, and Elijah was the leading prophet. Hence, the Old Testament was called “the Law and the Prophets” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106774" data-verses="Luke 16:16">Luke 16:16</span>). These two ministries have always been God’s testimony. For centuries, the law represented by Moses and the prophets represented by Elijah have been God’s witnesses on earth. Elijah’s mission was predicted (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106775" data-verses="Malachi 4:5">Mal. 4:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106776" data-verses="Matthew 17:11">Matt. 17:11</span>). </p>

Without the seventh trumpet, God’s economy and His move cannot be finished. By reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106840" data-verses="Revelation 8:1">chapters eight through eleven</span>, we see that the seven trumpets are truly a great thing. When the seventh trumpet sounds, many things will happen. This trumpet will sound for a period of time, and it will last for eternity, declaring, announcing, and proclaiming God’s eternal plan.

<p data-content-id="8xVo-B7NrMY0kPDgZqBD43ILLor-R_mwuq3Joqe2LOC9AD1rboXiIgCBQAwKW-c3U"> Once the saints have been resurrected, they will be raptured. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106896" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">First Thessalonians 4</span> indicates that the dead saints will rise up, not come down. Many Christians hold the mistaken concept that the dead saints are in heaven and that when the Lord Jesus comes, they will descend with Him. Read your Bible again. The saints will not come down; they will rise up and, with the living ones, will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air. It is not scriptural to say that the dead saints are now in heaven. </p>

<p data-content-id="S7HLy_RJGMBEkAmzzlkouqJfi8glxtxRvkQKX5yY3Yp0fuXWbDKB9XsII8Y1-HQSk"> During the past one and a half centuries, the rapture of the saints has been a troublesome matter for many seeking Christians. Mainly, there are three schools of understanding concerning the rapture: the school of pre-tribulation, the school of post-tribulation, and the school of the so-called partial rapture. Those in the school of partial rapture say that the overcomers will be raptured earlier than the majority of the believers. In each of these schools there have been some very spiritual saints who knew the Bible quite well. Because of conflicting opinions, there has been much debate about the rapture. Soon after I was saved, I began to study prophecy and, as a result, I became quite familiar with all these schools. As the fruit of many years of study, observation, and consideration, I wish to present in this message and in the message following a clear and simple word on the rapture according to the pure word of the Bible. Let us forget about all the schools and care only for the pure Word. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gmeJHU6Nz9bHbq5NUV6eCQpdOC0bKbgabNE5d2gHsrIOUvw44xUHcApdW5D5Qezd4">I. THE RAPTURE OF THE OVERCOMERS</h2><p data-content-id="eMGG8SZW5aKYwACjfS3uY0Bv-O78YpvpNMYqz5sYFrO7IjSJfZqHiVhS_6SOouZ-_"> In the Bible we see two aspects of the rapture: the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of the majority of the saints. That there are two aspects of the rapture does not mean there are only two raptures. With the rapture of the overcomers there are at least three categories. For instance, the rapture of the firstfruit differs from the rapture of the man-child. The man-child (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106957" data-verses="Revelation 12:5">12:5</span>) is composed of the dead overcomers in resurrection, and the firstfruit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106958" data-verses="Revelation 14:1-5">14:1-5</span>) are the living overcomers, those who have never passed through <span class="pg" data-page-id="338" id="338">[338]</span> death. When we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106959" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">chapter twelve</span>, we shall see that the man-child, like the woman clothed with the sun, is a symbol. The man-child in Revelation is begotten, brought forth in birth. Consider the Lord Jesus. He was begotten of God to be the Firstborn Son in resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106960" data-verses="Hebrews 1:5">Heb. 1:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106961" data-verses="Acts 13:33">Acts 13:33</span>). The man-child will also be begotten in resurrection. The resurrection of the man-child will be his birth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106962" data-verses="Revelation 12:11">Revelation 12:11</span> says that the overcomers who are a part of the man-child are faithful unto death, overcoming the enemy by the blood and by the word of their testimony, and not loving their soul lives unto death. This indicates that all those included in the man-child are faithful unto death. Many of them have been martyred. Hence, the man-child, which includes all the dead overcomers, is different from the firstfruit, who are the living overcomers. In addition to the man-child and the firstfruit, there is another company of overcomers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106963" data-verses="Revelation 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>: the late overcomers who overcome Antichrist, his mark, the number of his name, and his image, and who will be raptured to stand on the sea of glass to praise the Lord. Therefore, with respect to the overcomers, there are at least three different raptures. Besides this, there is the individual rapture of the two witnesses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106964" data-verses="Revelation 11:1">chapter eleven</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gvNTj0qyHK7fxM7muDqwkXAA_21BOovbfrgDct-kby-g5UvD45-QA3Mzygn6Yx6f"> The rapture of the overcomers is the first category of rapture, and the rapture of the majority of the saints, considered in Revelation as the harvest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106965" data-verses="Revelation 14:15">14:15</span>), is the second. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106966" data-verses="Leviticus 23:10">Leviticus 23:10</span> we see a type of the rapture—the type of the crops ripening in the field. Some crops ripen earlier and others ripen later. Those that ripen first are considered the firstfruit. In Old Testament times, the firstfruit was always brought, not to the barn, but into the temple of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106967" data-verses="Exodus 23:19">Exodus 23:19</span> clearly says, “The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God.” The firstfruit was brought from the field into the temple of God for God’s enjoyment and satisfaction. When the field was completely ripe, that was the time of the harvest. After the harvest was reaped, it was brought into the barn. This is a type. The crop is God’s people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="106968" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">1 Cor. 3:9</span>), and <span class="pg" data-page-id="339" id="339">[339]</span> the first of the crop to ripen is the firstfruit which will be brought directly to God’s temple in the heavens. After that transpires, the sunshine will become brighter, and the unripened crops, which are still green, will begin to ripen. When all the crop has ripened, the majority of the saints will be harvested and taken to the air. The air corresponds to the barn. On most farms the barn is between the field and the farmhouse. The harvest is stored in the barn, but the firstfruit is brought into the farmhouse for the farmer’s first taste. While many teachers have written concerning the rapture, most of them have not taken care of this matter of God’s crop. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106969" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> the Lord Jesus revealed that He came to sow seed into the field. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106970" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span> Paul tells the Corinthians, “You are God’s farm.” Finally, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="106971" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14</span>, we have the firstfruit and the harvest. This gives us the basic concept with respect to the rapture. </p>
<p data-content-id="Np0A3NXGY9sb0kEPalq_4D5FxDLc5pzsiVnvh4Vd3iry7xMwdQWdiN4zotccxw5rB"> Many Christians are too shallow and shortsighted. They do not read or study the Bible in a thorough way. Rather, selecting a few verses as their basis, they teach that all Christians will be raptured before the tribulation. They say that we were sinners who have been washed by the Lord’s blood, who have been regenerated by the Spirit, who have been saved, and who are now waiting for the coming back of the Lord Jesus, at which time we will all be raptured. Generally speaking, this is correct, and there is nothing wrong with it. However, it is a brief, careless, and superficial consideration of the matter. As an illustration of the vagueness and generality of the traditional teachings concerning the rapture, let me use the example of my former apartment on Arden Place in Anaheim. Everyone unfamiliar with the area had difficulty locating Arden Place. Some who knew that it was in the vicinity of Ball and Euclid have spent as much as an hour looking for Arden Place. They knew how to get to the corner of Ball and Euclid, but they did not have the detailed directions to get from there, by means of many small streets, to my apartment. Although it was correct to say that we lived near Ball and Euclid, the precise spot, <span class="pg" data-page-id="340" id="340">[340]</span> Arden Place at Juno, was somewhat hidden. In order to get there, one had to travel through a maze of small streets. </p>
<p data-content-id="UbDmKnrbR6wkXMKUDOIMD2P-iAGyL-FZE9lFaopaqfOk7Tikcu1gMU62N3Lsd0fR0"> Understanding the matter of the rapture in the New Testament is also like driving through a maze. It is very difficult to know this matter precisely. Perhaps the Lord meant it to be this way in order to arouse our watchfulness. Do not be confident that you know all about the rapture, for you may be like those who thought that they knew where I lived, but only knew the general vicinity of Ball and Euclid. Perhaps you know the rapture in a general way, but you are not familiar with the details. What we need is not a general map, but a detailed map. Most of the talk among Christians regarding the rapture is too general. It is like knowing the corner of Ball and Euclid without knowing the specific directions to my apartment. During the past fifty years, I have spent much time studying the rapture. Since 1925, whenever I could read or hear about this matter, I seized the opportunity to do so. Concerning the matter of the rapture, I have the assurance to say that the Lord has shown us the minute details, and in these two messages we need to examine some of these details. </p>
<p data-content-id="MfMdlEkgq-a1uKaUUALpAADpEeCSknjRfcVofpiZYMm5RgH8fZWaM9MIilSy8MI87"> The Lord Jesus will definitely come back before the millennium. Once there was a school of theology which taught that the Lord’s coming back would be after the millennium. Although this school was still there fifty years ago, it may be out-of-date by now. When I was young, I studied both the school that said the Lord would come before the millennium and the school that said He would come after the millennium. During the past fifty years, the second school has faded away, and hardly anyone seems to care for it. Perhaps you have never even heard of it. To say that Christ will come back after the millennium is absolutely unscriptural. Thus, only one school remains—that Christ will come before the millennium. This, however, is very general. We need to be much more exact and specific. It is absolutely correct to say that the Lord Jesus will come back before the millennium and that all Christians will be raptured, but we must still become familiar with the details. <span class="pg" data-page-id="341" id="341">[341]</span> </p>

Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left.” Here we see two brothers in the field and two sisters at the mill. One of the brothers and one of the sisters are taken and the others are left. Some among us, especially the young people, may love the Lord and think that they need not care for their human living. But in these verses we see two brothers working in the field and two sisters grinding at the mill. This is for eating. As long as we live on earth, we cannot ignore the need of eating. We must work in order to eat. Therefore, if you truly love the Lord, you must realize that while you are loving Him, you must still earn a living for yourself. While two are working in the field for their living, one will be taken and the other left. Outwardly they are the same, but inwardly they are different. If you read the context, you will see that one is watchful and ready and the other is not. While one is getting ready, the other is not watchful. </p>

The one in the field and the one grinding at the mill are taken before the others, the man-child is caught up to the throne of God before the last three and one-half years, and the firstfruit is taken before the harvest. No one can say that the harvest will be taken at the same time as the firstfruit.

Unless you do not believe the Bible, there can be no <span class="pg" data-page-id="351" id="351">[351]</span> argument about this.

To have this constant prayer does not require that we cease working. If you cannot pray while you are working, then your prayer must not be very genuine; rather, it must be a formal, religious performance. The best prayer is that while you are busy working, you constantly and simultaneously look unto the Lord with a living spirit. This is real and genuine prayer. We all can pray constantly. Even when I speak, I am praying. While you are fellowshipping with others, you should be praying. We need to be a praying people with a praying spirit. We need to pray all the time.

Watch and Be Ready</h2><p data-content-id="cgfMaJYFAO1mOpI22kRdhJ3KZaVLXVgHK7fr4_AyvD4ITdSSCh7v-cnqPDc7CCaPG"> A second condition is that we must watch and be ready (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107009" data-verses="Matthew 24:40-44">Matt. 24:40-44</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107010" data-verses="Luke 12:35-40">Luke 12:35-40</span>). We should be able to say, “Lord, I’m busy working, but I’m ready to go. Lord, here I am cleaning my things and keeping them in order, but I don’t want to live here forever. Lord, I’m ready to be taken.” Can you tell the Lord this? To be ready does not mean that we stop working and do nothing. In the last century, some people did this. A certain teacher told them that at a particular time Christ would come. After hearing this, they bathed thoroughly, put on white garments, and did nothing except pray. This is not the proper way to wait for the Lord’s coming back. The proper way is to live a normal life. The Bible nowhere tells us to take a shower, put on white clothing, and wait for the Lord to come back. Rather, the Lord Jesus says that no one will know the time. As two brothers will be working in the field, much to their surprise, one will suddenly be taken away and the other will be left. </p>
<p data-content-id="Yf-rmGLmzs8DVJKAZqsHcn6KlAam0OwpwCL8YYxWWYsYffHyYsR_Jf62ch9moi03S"> We must not understand the Bible according to our human concept. Many Christians who care for the Lord’s coming back hold the concept that since the Lord is coming soon, it is better for them to do nothing. No, everything depends upon a normal living and upon contacting the Lord <span class="pg" data-page-id="353" id="353">[353]</span> all the time with a living spirit. Tell the Lord, “Lord, I have no ties on earth. I’m ready to go anytime You want to take me.” This is the way to watch and to be ready. </p>

In Revelation we have the harvest of the truths sown in the beginning of the Bible. In this book of consummation, the local churches are crucial. The local churches are also the focus of this book. We have seen that the local churches are the destination of God’s progressive revelation and manifestation. In the Bible we not only have God’s revelation but also His manifestation. Revelation may be considered as being close to doctrine, but manifestation is definitely related to experience. Therefore, the Bible not only gives us the doctrine but also the experience, not only the revelation of God, but also the manifestation of God. If there were no local churches, there would be no destination for God’s revelation and manifestation. </p>
<p data-content-id="LT7GHt_97QehEFI0vw7uvsMOqm_I6pLJAK6-4yadHVCpNEmCwmz8MPsIjIZIRoY7N"> The subtle enemy, Satan, hates the local churches. Throughout the centuries, many good Christian teachers have devoted their attention to many other things. We admit that some of these things have been important. Nevertheless, most of these teachers have still missed the mark, missing the destination of the local churches. We must worship and praise God for being the Lord. He would never let this matter go. After recovering so many items during the past several centuries, in our time He has come to this destination. This is the reason that, day and night, our only burden is to build up the local churches. All the attack and opposition that we undergo are simply because of our stand for the local churches. <span class="pg" data-page-id="362" id="362">[362]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mQZCaUskgKXnWQwz5-GjAk8SsRNCcEcUewFvjwcuYXvkPdWSc6wkDFGa6M3STyygs">THE LAMPSTAND AS A TYPE OF THE CHURCH</h2><p data-content-id="ZwRw-sIjrvKZJVrX9K-LjtjuXh22XzATTWw_AihsrUNSru4xxjkdO4VC6khkUMgY3"> Everybody knows that the term church is not found in the Old Testament. The first time it is used is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107055" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>, where the Lord Jesus said, “I will build my church.” However, in the Old Testament there are many types that foreshadow the church. For instance, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107056" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we have the bride as a type of the church being Christ’s counterpart. Furthermore, both the tabernacle and the temple are types of the church being God’s dwelling place among men on earth. The children of Israel as a corporate people signify that the church is also a corporate people to express God. None of these types, however, is as all-inclusive as the lampstand. </p>
<p data-content-id="ADcOpTWyGt901MiqV_ZKRV6F4PjPIsTaZ6KLGZIyWdC9Glu88RqQYZsBIACfYqBFW"> The lampstand is first mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107057" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span>. If we only had this chapter, we would be unable to realize that the lampstand is related to the church or to the churches. Near the end of the Old Testament, we find the lampstand mentioned again in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107058" data-verses="Zechariah 4:1">Zechariah 4</span>. Zechariah shows some progress and improvement over Exodus. In Exodus we only have the lampstand with the seven lamps; there is no mention of what the seven lamps refer to. But in Zechariah we are given a definite interpretation of the seven lamps, for in this book we are told that the seven lamps are the seven eyes of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107059" data-verses="Zechariah 4:10">4:10</span>) and the seven eyes of the stone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107060" data-verses="Zechariah 3:9">3:9</span>). Zechariah tells us two main things regarding the lampstand—that the seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven eyes of God and the seven eyes of the stone. Consider the picture presented in Zechariah. That the stone has seven eyes, which are the seven eyes of God, indicates that these seven eyes infuse what God is into us. God is light, life, love, holiness, etc. All that He is as the life element is infused into us through His seven eyes. This is even true of us as human beings, for as we look at others something of us is infused into them through our eyes. What is the significance of the seven eyes of God also being the seven eyes of the stone? Undoubtedly, the stone is for building. Thus, these seven eyes not only infuse God as the life element into our being; they also infuse Christ into us as the building material, making us <span class="pg" data-page-id="363" id="363">[363]</span> the material for God’s building. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107061" data-verses="Zechariah 4:2-6">Zechariah 4:2-6</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107062" data-verses="Zechariah 4:10">10</span> also imply that these seven eyes of God, which are the seven lamps of the lampstand, are the Spirit. In answering the question, “What are these?” it says, “Not by might nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107063" data-verses="Zechariah 4:6">4:6</span>). This verse indicates that it is only through the Spirit that we can be prevailing in God’s building. Hence, we can see that the lampstand in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107064" data-verses="Zechariah 4:1">Zechariah 4</span> reveals a definite development beyond the lampstand in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107065" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span>. However, Zechariah is not the book of consummation, and we must continue until we come to the last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="FrpbcRt3yRk0Uxjm1URW7Eg08hWMqO4pTrxPj1VjX3CdPg4WUZDe1ebWLRh8zhLuo"> In Revelation there are seven golden lampstands. This book also reveals that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God and the seven eyes of the Lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107066" data-verses="Revelation 5:6">5:6</span>). Therefore, the lampstand includes God, Christ, the Spirit, the Redeemer, and the building material. </p>

Firstly, we must participate in the essence, the golden element, of the lampstand. Secondly, we must experience the forming of this golden substance into a definite form—the stand. The gold in the lampstand is not a lump; rather, it is formed into a stand. Thirdly, along with the form, we must experience the expression of the lampstand through the shining of the seven lamps. Fourthly, there is the matter of the reproduction of the lampstand. Hence, we must experience four aspects of the lampstand—the element, the form, the expression, and the reproduction. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="RcLtLXvO2x49e5HSqeDCRKXOxUMfwkQDyI7Yq7O3GLi69XubFEtTV_iN6b9MI_Z-a">EXPERIENCING THE GOLDEN ELEMENT</h2><p data-content-id="sgITvoUbLp9kr7so-lifik0UEjic_l2aWiA8xIiSnO6y-U0RpWzmI90zjb8ycRLz9"> We all need to experience the golden element of the lampstand. If we only have an ounce of gold, how could we form a lampstand? This would be impossible. We might be able to make a ring, but certainly not a lampstand. In order to have a lampstand, there must be a talent of gold <span class="pg" data-page-id="364" id="364">[364]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107069" data-verses="Exodus 25:39">Exo. 25:39</span>). (A talent equals approximately one hundred pounds, or sixteen hundred ounces.) We need more gold, more of God. If we would have the church as the lampstand, we must have something substantial—the gold, which is the substance, the essence, the element, of God Himself. If we do not have this substance, all our talk about the church is vain. How pitiful is the situation among so many Christians today. They have so little of the substance, of the divine gold; instead of acquiring the substance, they discuss vain doctrine. Even if our doctrine is sound, right, fundamental, and scriptural, it is not God Himself. Only God Himself is the element. How we need God as the golden element! </p>
<p data-content-id="w61C8Sf0pRjO1CqIL2kXUnSo7u5G3VbXzFDh5Au7smcx1nKys-XlikrZOIVeRdjoV"> What is God? In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107070" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span> the Lord Jesus clearly said, “God is Spirit.” In Greek, there is no article before the word <em>Spirit.</em> Thus, we should not say that God is a Spirit, but that God is Spirit. To say that God is Spirit is like saying that the table is wood. Just as the element of the table is wood, so the element of God is Spirit. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107071" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span> in order to worship God we must worship Him in spirit. To worship God is not simply to bow down to Him; it is to reach Him, to contact Him, and to receive Him. According to the context of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107072" data-verses="John 4:1">John 4</span>, to worship God is to drink of Him as the living water (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107073" data-verses="John 4:14">v. 14</span>), which is the very Spirit flowing into our being. How can we receive Him into us as this living water? We receive Him by opening our whole being to Him and by exercising our spirit. We must receive God Himself as the golden element into the depths of our being. Day and night, we need to open ourselves. Never close yourself to Him or shut any part of your being to Him. Rather, tell Him, “O God, I am absolutely open to You. I exercise my spirit to contact You, the divine Spirit. O divine Spirit, come into me and saturate me.” This is the way to gain more gold. </p>

The most difficult thing that faced me was getting through the first three chapters, especially the two chapters concerning the seven churches. In the seven epistles to the seven churches there are many difficult verses which hardly anyone can explain. One of the most difficult verses is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107074" data-verses="Revelation 3:12">3:12</span>, where the Lord said, “He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God and My new name.” When I read this verse fifty-one years ago, I had a very difficult time understanding it. What does it mean to say that the Lord will make us a pillar in the temple of God and that He will write the name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and His new name upon us? None of the books I consulted regarding this matter could answer my question. Although even a fourth grader can understand the words, it is most difficult to apprehend the true significance of this verse. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107075" data-verses="Revelation 3:12">Revelation 3:12</span> has been a difficult verse for all expositors because none of them has had the adequate experience. Through the years, I eventually have come to realize that this promise is the greatest among the seven promises in the seven epistles in Revelation two and three. In this message we need to consider this promise of the Lord to the overcomer in the church in Philadelphia. <span class="pg" data-page-id="370" id="370">[370]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Wg7ThGFRgCC6wAt8IVPuOma0I50vGK0qES7VfaycMTRB5rcUso_47aspsnn4s6CTX">THE GREATEST BLESSING</h2><p data-content-id="2dKAFOptUaVJ1O8CsbCZpWVpddnfZH7rD3ZULTjfRG56qNxhXho1DQvZyTnlBjLC6"> We cannot understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107076" data-verses="Revelation 3:12">3:12</span> unless we have the necessary experience. The Lord’s promise here is not to give us something but to make us something. Whenever we think of the Lord’s promises, we always think that He will give us something. According to our concept, a promise is related to a blessing. To us, without a blessing, there can be no promise. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107077" data-verses="Revelation 3:12">3:12</span> the Lord did not say, “I will give him”; He said, “I will make him.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107078" data-verses="Revelation 3:12">3:12</span> the Lord does not promise to give us holiness or a heavenly blessing. No, here He promises to make us become something—a pillar in the temple of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="udGqnkRQe0Fa75Rq062nBbUbBNOCpu5uLLQkayoHbSEK216rHpUxhj5eVqRJadTMc"> Becoming a pillar in the temple of God involves two things—transformation and building. Since I came to this country, my burden has been on these two matters. The greatest blessing the Lord can render us is to transform us and to build us into His temple. Most Christians have been unable to understand what it means to be made a pillar in the temple of God. What does this mean? And what does it mean to have the name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and the new name of the Lord written upon us? But those who have reached the level of the church in Philadelphia have the proper understanding within them. If we are on this level, then we are ready for the Lord to transform us. If we use the little power we have received of the Lord on His word and mean business with Him, then we are ready to be transformed and are in the proper position for the Lord to make us a pillar. This requires that we firstly be transformed into precious material and secondly that we be built into a pillar. How can we, who are clay, become a pillar in God’s temple? There is no way except to be transformed from clay into precious stone and then to be built into God’s building. Prior to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107079" data-verses="Revelation 3:12">3:12</span>, we have the Lord’s promise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107080" data-verses="Revelation 2:17">2:17</span> that indicates that we can be transformed into a white stone by eating Him as the hidden manna. This is truly the greatest blessing. This involves our very being, for it is related to what we are. The greatest blessing is not what the Lord gives us, but what the Lord makes us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="371" id="371">[371]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="fGUGkn5to2I5UFoKv1VNdQtvkcRTkWpfFL58bNBasS6Otne5-f2c6FWgAyNaUaldn"> Suppose I am a mass of clay. No matter what you give me, whether it be gold or diamonds, I am still clay. Even if you would bring me into heaven and place me in front of God Himself, I would still be clay. The greatest blessing is that the Lord would transform me into something related to God’s dwelling place. In the church life we should not expect objective blessings. Rather, we must realize that the Lord’s blessing is always to make us something, to transform us into precious material, and then to build us into God’s building. If you take this word into you, it will absolutely revolutionize your concept. If you have seen this vision, would you still expect the Lord to bless you with outward things? No, we would drop this expectation. If we have truly seen this vision, we shall realize that in the church life the Lord’s intention is not to do something outside of us, but something altogether related to our very being. He will make us into another being. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ITBVDgsapCA5h0Ba51FA5D5vn4qu3jamvrF7YxN5-1GluETQyeBTiS_tmIqIxEe99">THE THREE NAMES WRITTEN UPON US</h2><p data-content-id="dqTRyG6GA884EmjvR4UyOegfOIBGULNc9pTPOwHALeZwBCUtG7wCY77G5UKUOOnaQ"> The Lord will not only make us into pillars, but He will write three names upon us: the name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and His new name. To write a name on something is to give it a designation. If I were to ask you your name, what would you say? Would you have the boldness to say, “My name is God”? To say this is not blasphemous, because the Lord promised to write the name of God upon us. Suppose I am the one on whom the Lord has written God’s name, and you ask me my name. I would say, “Please read what is written upon me—<em>G-o-d.</em> This is my name, my designation.” Some of the opposers may criticize me for saying this. But do not accuse or blame me of being blasphemous. I am just one who is being written upon—He is the Writer. You must blame Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="QpDUAnrDI_WRFtrr3f3Kzh9t_afEEQi3lhyUHZa2seNBxZHOZbMQUNSElYwe-H2bi"> The Lord will also write upon us the name of New Jerusalem. How much of the New Jerusalem is written upon you? Perhaps others can only see upon you the letters <em>N-e-w J-e-r.</em> But eventually, after a certain period of time, every letter of the name <em>New Jerusalem</em> will be written upon you. <span class="pg" data-page-id="372" id="372">[372]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="KieXqJ7jgoER4UdfBfZNeFTK3jn-sPhh6wo2bjONxSaxFCktk5VChNS7qxKtiNlUj"> Finally, the Lord will write His new name upon us. Because the Lord is always new, He certainly does not have an old name, but a new name. What is this new name of the Lord? It is the very Christ whom we experience. Only after we have had the adequate experience will we receive this new designation. By all this we can see that the greatest blessing is for the Lord to make us like God, to make us a part of the New Jerusalem, and to make us an expression of Christ in a new way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lNulM8LrKW8XhGNjyhb8z8_RDBxcvEBrAM_UAfWfx_DwAjiko112RRWMunPS7zWYR">THE LORD’S WAY OF WRITING UPON US</h2><p data-content-id="OPc0C_l9lbNcoMQBRuTefKizJppFY0ZNF3gAaE0-NZcyLxO2KT0pWsR4uiaTts0_i"> We in the churches must see that the Lord’s greatest blessing is that He promises us to make us become something. The way in which He accomplishes this is to work Himself into us. The writing of the name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and the new name of the Lord upon us actually refers to the working of God into us, to the working of the New Jerusalem into our being, and to the working of the attributes of Christ into us as His new expression. Eventually, through this working, these three new names will be written upon us. The working of His element into us is the writing of these names upon us. </p>
<p data-content-id="4GbJibLcKEjqL__jjhGizlp7xcdoj_c18dd9DdMU_NFm4J0W2ehtPh_Rk31LQn9uY"> Consider the example of petrified wood. Firstly, we have a piece of ordinary wood. As water flows through it, it carries away the natural wooden element and replaces it with a solid mineral element. As this process transpires, the wood is gradually petrified. After the completion of this process, we may write upon that piece of wood the words <em>petrified wood.</em> This designation describes what has been wrought into the very fiber of the wood. </p>

It is difficult to understand this matter of engraving the stone. In brief, it means that the Lord Jesus, as the building stone, was engraved, dealt with, by God on the cross for the iniquity of God’s people. In one day, by that engraving on the cross, the Lord Jesus took away all the sins of God’s people. This is the equivalent of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107091" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>, which says, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” By the latter half of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107092" data-verses="Zechariah 3:9">Zechariah 3:9</span> we know that the stone with the seven eyes is Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="by2v23Nedf13WGfghX9I29VrvxV_rARCOuCyECvjxyFHKSsKwXMqeaZkYrTMh3eTi">THE SEVEN EYES AND<br/>THE SEVEN LAMPS</h2><p data-content-id="qFT3je7o6rEOFRguDp8CG0dTloqY9eLv-CuesvcrtybeUNGaiOI26ePMHk72T6-ua"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107093" data-verses="Zechariah 4:2">Zechariah 4:2</span> says, “What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof” (Heb.). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107094" data-verses="Zechariah 3:9">Zechariah 3:9</span> the building stone has seven eyes, and in this verse the lampstand has seven lamps. If we exercise our spirit in this matter, we shall surely understand that the lampstand equals the stone. Both the stone and the lampstand are Christ. Obviously, the stone is for the building, and the lampstand is for light, for enlightening. On the <span class="pg" data-page-id="382" id="382">[382]</span> stone there are seven eyes, and on the lampstand there are seven lamps. Hence, the seven lamps of the lampstand must be the seven eyes on the stone. </p>
<p data-content-id="yIistfmiI2_aDzgmmvCwMJLHFt4HeoDpV_WNoVoXfyhbv9uKSdjFfOREsc87szYIq"> Proceeding to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107095" data-verses="Zechariah 4:10">Zechariah 4:10</span>, we read, “For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth.” This verse begins with a reference to “the day of small things.” In the eyes of men, the recovery of the building was not a great thing. Nevertheless, no one should despise it. Likewise, the recovery of the church life today is not a great thing in the eyes of men. Rather, it is a small thing. But no one should despise it. This verse also speaks of “those seven,” which refers to the seven lamps in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107096" data-verses="Zechariah 4:2">verse 2</span>. Then we are told that “those seven” are “the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth.” This proves that the building stone with the seven eyes is simply Jehovah, the Lord God Himself. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8xVo-B7NrMY0kPDgZqBD43ILKqb-ZvWwuq3Joqe2LOC9AD1rboXiIgCBQAwKW-c3U">THE SEVEN SPIRITS OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="ADcOpTWyGt901MiqV_ZKRV6F4PDPB-zaZ6KLGZIyWdC9Glu88RqQYZsBIACfYqBFW"> Having this understanding, we come to the book of Revelation. I say again that most of the symbols and other crucial points found in Revelation are not new; they are further developments of items found in the Old Testament. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107097" data-verses="Revelation 4:1-2">Revelation chapters four and five</span>, we have a new and further development of the seven eyes and the seven lamps. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107098" data-verses="Revelation 4:5">Revelation 4:5</span> says, “And out of the throne come forth lightnings and voices and thunders; and seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.” Notice that the seven lamps here are not on the lampstand, but are burning before the throne. The seven lamps that are burning before the throne are the seven Spirits of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107099" data-verses="Zechariah 3:1-2">Zechariah 3 and 4</span> we have the seven eyes and the seven lamps but not the seven Spirits. In Revelation, however, the seven lamps have developed into the seven Spirits. Here we have a new and further development of the seven lamps as the seven Spirits. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107100" data-verses="Revelation 4:5">4:5</span> we are told clearly that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="383" id="383">[383]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="FrpbcRt3yRk0Uxjm1URW7Eg08h2MicIpTrxPj1VjX3CdPg4WUZDe1ebWLRh8zhLuo"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107101" data-verses="Revelation 5:6">Revelation 5:6</span> says, “And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.” The Lamb here has seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107102" data-verses="Revelation 4:5">4:5</span> the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107103" data-verses="Revelation 5:6">5:6</span> the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God. Here we have a further development over Zechariah, for the seven eyes are not only the seven eyes on the stone, but also the seven eyes of the Lamb. These seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. This is a reference to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107104" data-verses="Zechariah 4:10">Zechariah 4:10</span>, where we are told that the seven eyes of the Lord “run to and fro through the whole earth.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107105" data-verses="Zechariah 3:1-2">Zechariah 3 and 4</span> we see the seven eyes of the stone, the seven lamps of the lampstand, and the seven eyes of the Lord. Thus, the Lord is the stone, and the stone is also the lampstand. The stone is both the lampstand and the Lord God Himself. These three—the Lord, the lampstand, and the stone—are one. In Zechariah, we see that the seven eyes are the seven lamps. But as we come to the further development in Revelation, the seven lamps are no longer just on the lampstand, but are also burning before the throne. These seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God. Eventually, these seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the Lamb who is in the very center of God’s administration. May we all be deeply impressed with this picture. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Cs3ONxeMth5mwllbyYf4lOgkOzF9uaDV8RSd8O8Hqv0o7uTpEdoOJ6dbZT0nyJr-e">EVERYTHING FOR GOD’S BUILDING</h2><p data-content-id="P8jMkwpkLdBOj0p4O-2xBwjyIWUfwn8fuCHBwhorQzQcIaMpTU1ljj4-xfrJokpi-"> According to the context of both Zechariah and Revelation, all this is for God’s building. The stone and the lampstand are mentioned in Zechariah at the time when Zerubbabel was rebuilding the temple. In Revelation, we firstly have the seven lampstands symbolizing the seven local churches. Later, we have the throne before which the seven lamps are burning. Ultimately, this throne is the center of the New Jerusalem. This reveals that the New Jerusalem comes into existence by means of the seven Spirits burning <span class="pg" data-page-id="384" id="384">[384]</span> before the throne. By all this we can see that the seven eyes, the seven lamps, the seven Spirits, the stone, the lampstand, the Lord, God, and the Lamb are all for the building. This building is the temple, the church today and the New Jerusalem, God’s eternal habitation, in eternity. </p>
<p data-content-id="-m2NLiiFqCHFHE8nxPFGHsCUav1PVsF0yGcvkTVWCVV_Epm3QfZFd6BUh2KJg6mtY"> Suppose we had only two books, the Gospel of John and Revelation, both written by the apostle John. If we read these books again and again, what would we see? Let us begin with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107106" data-verses="John 1:1">John chapter one</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107107" data-verses="John 1:1">Verse 1</span> says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107108" data-verses="John 1:14">verse 14</span> says, “And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107109" data-verses="John 1:29">Verse 29</span> says, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107110" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1</span>, many words are used to describe this One: the Word, God, the flesh, and the Lamb. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107111" data-verses="John 1:4">Verse 4</span> says, “In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.” With Him there were also grace and reality. When Peter was brought to this wonderful One, He changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which means a stone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107112" data-verses="John 1:42">v. 42</span>). When Nathanael met Him, He said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107113" data-verses="John 1:51">v. 51</span>). This word reminds us of Jacob’s dream, the center of which is Bethel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107114" data-verses="Genesis 28:10-22">Gen. 28:10-22</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107115" data-verses="John 1:1">John chapter one</span>, extending from eternity past to eternity future, covers a great deal. In eternity past there was the Word, and in eternity future there will be Bethel, the house, the dwelling of God. This will be the New Jerusalem. This one chapter reaches from eternity to eternity. Of course, John takes another twenty chapters to develop all the points covered in the first chapter. </p>

The second section, comprising the last eleven chapters, gives details of the important things and crucial matters from the last three and a half years of the present age, which will be the period of the great tribulation, to the eternal age of the new heaven and new earth. The first of these important things and crucial matters revealed in this section is a woman with a man-child (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107130" data-verses="Revelation 12:1-18">12:1-18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="rFrCGjzy0s3seaoP5ZFz1WE5fBcBC8Jn7QPczLYQpR6KGf-mSZlvxLAT6G-4WlYEl"> The first eleven chapters of this book cover the seven seals and the seven trumpets. The seven seals and the seven trumpets give us a brief yet inclusive sketch of the contents of this book. The first four seals (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107131" data-verses="Revelation 6:1-8">6:1-8</span>) cover the nearly two thousand years of history from the time of Christ’s ascension until the end of this age. We are now living at the very end of this age, very close to the time of the fifth seal. The fifth seal (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107132" data-verses="Revelation 6:9-11">6:9-11</span>) consists of the prayer of the martyred saints. When this seal is opened, the thousands of martyred saints who have been slain for the Lord’s testimony will cry to God for vengeance, beseeching Him to intervene and deal with rebellious mankind. The sixth seal (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107133" data-verses="Revelation 6:12-17">6:12-17</span>) will be God’s answer to the cry of the martyred saints. The supernatural calamities of this seal will be a warning to those who dwell on this earth. These six seals bring us to the end of this age. </p>
<p data-content-id="dqTRyG6GA884EmjvR4UyOegfOJhGTZtc9pTPOwHALeZwBCUtG7wCY77G5UKUOOnaQ"> The seventh seal, which includes the seven trumpets, is all-inclusive. Since the seven trumpets are the content of the seventh seal, the seventh seal equals the seven trumpets. The first four trumpets (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107134" data-verses="Revelation 8:7-12">8:7-12</span>) are supernatural calamities, God’s judgment upon the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun, moon, and stars. These four trumpets will damage <span class="pg" data-page-id="398" id="398">[398]</span> heaven and earth, causing the earth to no longer be a suitable place on which mankind can dwell. The heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for mankind to dwell on. However, since mankind has continually disappointed God, rebelling against Him, God will eventually declare that His toleration has come to an end. The great earthquake and the shaking of heaven in the sixth seal will be a warning to earth’s dwellers. This warning will be an introduction to the supernatural calamities to follow. After the first four trumpets have been sounded, the time of the great tribulation will be at hand. The sixth seal and the first four trumpets of the seventh seal will be a preliminary to the great tribulation. The fifth trumpet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107135" data-verses="Revelation 9:1-11">9:1-11</span>), which will bring damage directly to man, will be the beginning of the great tribulation. The fifth trumpet is the first of the three woes mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107136" data-verses="Revelation 8:13">8:13</span>. The sixth trumpet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107137" data-verses="Revelation 9:12-21">9:12-21</span>), a further judgment on men, will be the second woe. The third woe (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107138" data-verses="Revelation 11:14">11:14</span>), part of the negative content of the seventh trumpet, will consist of the seven bowls of God’s wrath poured out upon Antichrist, his people, and his kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107139" data-verses="Revelation 16:1-12">16:1-12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107140" data-verses="Revelation 16:17-21">17-21</span>). These seven bowls included in the seventh trumpet will close the great tribulation. After this, the Lord Jesus will come down to earth to fight Antichrist at the war of Armageddon. Antichrist will be defeated and, with the false prophet, will be cast into the lake of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107141" data-verses="Revelation 19:19-21">19:19-21</span>). Following this, the millennial kingdom, lasting a thousand years, will be ushered in. Then will come the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem for eternity. The seventh trumpet will last for eternity. This is a brief sketch of the book of Revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="QpDUAnrDI_WRFtrr3f3Kzh9t_b_ECCS3lhyUHZa2seNBxZHOZbMQUNSElYwe-H2bi"> The scroll of God’s economy which Christ has opened needs eternity to be fully opened. Today, we can only see a portion of it. When we get into the new heaven and new earth and live in the New Jerusalem, we shall have a much fuller vision than we have now. The scroll which we shall see in eternity will be eternally long. The seventh trumpet, which continues into eternity, includes many significant things: the last part of the great tribulation, the resurrection <span class="pg" data-page-id="399" id="399">[399]</span> and rapture of the majority of the believers, the reward to the saints, the fall of Babylon the Great, the marriage of the Lamb, the seven bowls, Christ’s descent to the earth with His overcomers as His army to fight Antichrist at Armageddon, the binding of Satan, the millennial kingdom, the last rebellion of mankind, Satan’s being cast into the lake of fire, the judgment at the great white throne, the new heaven, the new earth, and the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="KieXqJ7jgoER4UdfBfZNeFTK3iH-ldhh6wo2bjONxSaxFCktk5VChNS7qxKtiNlUj"> Brother Nee conducted a study of the book of Revelation when he was young. After that study, he saw more and more light concerning this book. In 1933, we asked him to give us a thorough study of the book of Revelation. He told us that he would not give us the study we had requested unless we had read this book so many times that we knew every chapter and could almost recite the entire book. At the time, I thought that this demand was too great. But through the years I have gradually learned that if we would understand this book, we must be fully acquainted with all the points and details it contains. We must be thoroughly familiar with every chapter. </p>
<p data-content-id="lNulM8LrKW8XhGNjyhb8z8_RDARcnWRrAM_UAfWfx_DwAjiko112RRWMunPS7zWYR"> We have seen that the first eleven chapters of Revelation are a general sketch and that the last eleven chapters give us the details of certain important things and crucial matters. Do not consider the last eleven chapters as the continuation of the first eleven chapters. No, in a sense, the last eleven chapters are a retracing of the first eleven chapters. Reading the book of Revelation is similar to reading a map of a city. First, we look at the main streets and see a general sketch of the city. Then we go back to consider the smaller streets, lanes, and other details. After gaining a general understanding of the map, we proceed to consider it section by section. </p>
<p data-content-id="GYIVpUWkuZmHSrN-tf6YUfoxp6v6wp2-OL81T49tkhetZaHINSoSt6T3Ue9-usg-C"> The first important detail and crucial matter in the second half of Revelation is the woman mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107142" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">12:1</span>. This verse says, “And a great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.” Here, the woman is revealed in the heavens and is called “a great <span class="pg" data-page-id="400" id="400">[400]</span> sign.” This great sign is not of a strong man but of a woman. The woman in this tremendous vision is not on the earth but in the heavens. She is clothed with the sun, underneath her feet is the moon, and on her head is a crown of twelve stars. She is under the shining of the twelve stars, above the shining of the moon, and enveloped with the shining of the sun. Because of this, she is fully emancipated. Anything that is in darkness is bound and imprisoned, but anything that is in the light is released and emancipated. </p>
<p data-content-id="cgfMaJYFAO1mOpI22kRdhJ3KZbVLUUAHK7fr4_AyvD4ITdSSCh7v-cnqPDc7CCaPG"> Would you like to be a part of this woman? Let me ask you this question: Are you a male or a female? All the sisters, of course, find this question easy to answer. But what would the brothers say? If they say that they are males, then they have no part in the woman of this vision. Does this woman include you? If it does, then, in the eyes of God, you are a female. </p>

One of them is Jacob’s dream at Bethel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107190" data-verses="Genesis 28:10-22">Gen. 28:10-22</span>). In that dream Jacob saw heaven opened and a ladder set up on earth extending from earth to heaven. This sign needs the whole Bible for its development. Another sign is Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107191" data-verses="Daniel 2:1-45">Dan. 2:1-45</span>). In that dream he saw a great image symbolizing the power of the Gentiles. Although that sign appears simple, it covers the Gentile powers from Babylon to the coming kingdoms of the revived Roman Empire. If we would understand that sign fully and adequately, we need to consider the whole of world history. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107192" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span> there is still another sign—the great sign of the bright woman with the man-child. In this message I am burdened to give a further word on this great sign. </p>
<p data-content-id="cgfMaJYFAO1mOpI22kRdhJ3KZbFLQGwHK7fr4_AyvD4ITdSSCh7v-cnqPDc7CCaPG"> The view that the woman in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107193" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span> is Mary is entirely too narrow. To say that the woman is merely Israel, the race of the Jews, is also inadequate, for the woman in this vision is not local but universal. The woman in this chapter is not limited to any locality on earth; rather, she occupies the universe. As we have seen in the last message, she represents the totality of God’s people from Adam until the end. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Yf-rmGLmzs8DVJKAZqsHcn6KlBKmweQpwCL8YYxWWYsYffHyYsR_Jf62ch9moi03S">GOD’S NEED<br/>FOR THE WOMAN AND THE MAN-CHILD</h2><p data-content-id="EquHWEovemLQ65DjOF9kgzpp5tyOCkesiQtpIkUhAc0HmLnNxgDapPV_nZlY4Z7aR"> Before God’s people can be the man-child, they must firstly be a woman to Him. This indicates that we in the church today must firstly be the woman to God and then the man-child. By the sign in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107194" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span> we see that God’s intention is to bring forth a man-child through this woman. <span class="pg" data-page-id="412" id="412">[412]</span> The woman has been and still is the means by which God can bring forth this man-child, the one whom God will use to defeat His enemy and to bring in His kingdom. In other words, God will use this man-child to fulfill His economy and to accomplish His purpose. This is a great matter. In order to accomplish His purpose, God not only needs the individual Christ but also a corporate Christ, the church, God’s people. We do not agree with the concept that this woman is merely the mother of Jesus or the nation of Israel. She is the universal, corporate body of God’s people. God needs the man-child to defeat His enemy and to bring in His kingdom that His eternal purpose might be accomplished. In order for Him to have such a man-child, there is the need of the woman. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="D08BEZDWCoGzl9aRgkuTZIQB1EDk9tTSwTEtOAeTiI-pN0qDlIp5_x909EdoSb6yb">THE POSITION OF THE WOMAN</h2><p data-content-id="S7HLy_RJGMBEkAmzzlkouqJfj_gl9txRvkQKX5yY3Yp0fuXWbDKB9XsII8Y1-HQSk"> Now we need to see a few crucial matters relating to the position of the woman in the Bible. The Bible reveals that in God’s eyes His people are His wife. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107195" data-verses="Isaiah 54:1">Isaiah 54</span> God even refers to Himself as the husband to His people. According to the Bible, in order for a woman to be a proper wife, she must submit to her husband. In this universe the unique husband, the unique man, is God. God, the universal man, the universal husband, is our husband. Whether we are males or females by birth, being God’s people, we are females in God’s eyes. God is our husband, and we are His counterpart. As His wife, we must submit ourselves to Him. Although we may say that we are a wife to Christ, we still have our own way and intention. Often, we do not take His will and intention as ours. This means that we do not actually take Him as our husband or submit to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="2dKAFOptUaVJ1O8CsbCZpWVpdcXfeVbrD3ZULTjfRG56qNxhXho1DQvZyTnlBjLC6"> A wife must also receive something from her husband in order to become pregnant. The Bible reveals that submission is to receive something of Christ, just as the woman submits to her husband, not to do something for him but to receive something of him. Nothing that a wife does for her husband is more important than receiving something of her husband. Actually a wife’s duty is not to do things for her husband; it <span class="pg" data-page-id="413" id="413">[413]</span> is to receive something of her husband that she may bring forth something for her husband. In the great sign in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107196" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span>, the woman is not portrayed as doing anything for her husband; she is pictured as being pregnant. She has been impregnated by her husband in order to bring forth something for her husband. The church’s duty is not mainly to do something for Christ. Her duty is to receive something of Christ that she may be made pregnant of Christ and may bring forth something for Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="udGqnkRQe0Fa75Rq062nBbUbBM-Cv8JuLLQkayoHbSEK216rHpUxhj5eVqRJadTMc"> The woman in this chapter firstly indicates submission to God. Secondly, she indicates that we do not need to do anything for God. What we need is to receive something of God. He does not need anything of us, but we need something of Christ to enter into our being that we might be made pregnant and might bring forth something for Him. The church today needs Christ. This vision is altogether lacking in today’s Christianity. When Christians speak about submission, their concept is to do something for Christ, to perform some work for God. But as the proper woman, we must firstly submit ourselves to our husband, not to do something for Him but to receive something of Him. If we do this, we shall be made pregnant, and something will be brought forth through us. </p>

Fornication is to have a husband and to submit yourself to another man. Many Christians today, perhaps including some of us, are committing fornication. We commit fornication when, on the one hand, we admit that Christ is our husband, while, on the other hand, we submit to so many other things. Submitting ourselves to anything other than Christ is fornication. If we have the light, the vision, we shall see that Christianity today is full of this kind of fornication. As a chaste wife, you should not submit to anyone other than your husband, and you should not receive anything from anyone else. To receive something from someone other than your husband is fornication. But look at today’s Christianity! Week after <span class="pg" data-page-id="414" id="414">[414]</span> week and day after day, Christians are receiving things other than Christ. We in the church life should be careful not to receive anything other than Christ. We should not receive teachings, doctrines, practices, or forms. To receive something other than Christ, even if that thing is good or even scriptural, is to commit spiritual fornication. We should receive only Christ and allow only Him to make us pregnant. </p>

The man-child is formed wholly of the constituent of Christ. In order to produce the man-child, we must first be one with Christ and receive something of Him. When we receive something uniquely of Christ, we shall be made pregnant of Christ to bring forth the man-child. If you see this vision, you will feel sorrowful about the situation in today’s Christianity. Where is the man-child? Christianity has produced many things, but there is nearly no man-child. Because Christianity has been impregnated of things other than Christ, hardly anything that it brings forth is the man-child. </p>
<p data-content-id="kJtprzMv-iEybgkzNyzDTDV_H5HZ36PsrUhhtuCMESGHnnFsJwP3wtj5eeGMBki0p"> God does not intend for the woman to fight the dragon. God intends to use the man-child to fight against the dragon. The dragon is still active in the heavens because the man-child has not yet been brought forth. Now we can see that this life-study of Revelation is not accidental; it was planned and timed by God that we all might see that we must be the unique woman submitting ourselves only to Christ, not to anything or anyone else, and that we must receive only what is of Christ. When, as this woman, we receive something uniquely of Christ, the man-child will be brought forth. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107202" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span> the woman was local and individual; the seed, Christ, was also individual; and the serpent was a small snake. All three, the woman, the seed, and the serpent, were individual and on a small scale. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107203" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span> the woman is universal and collective, symbolizing all of God’s people: the patriarchs represented by the twelve stars; Israel represented by the moon; and the church, the New Testament believers, represented by the sun. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107204" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span> the serpent has become a dragon. While the serpent creeps on earth, the dragon flies through the air. Now Satan not only moves on the earth but is also exceedingly active in the air. The seed in this chapter is not just the individual Christ but is a corporate entity, the corporate Christ, including Christ as the Head and all His overcoming believers as the Body. Hence, the three items found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107205" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span> are seen in a highly developed form in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107206" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span>. In this message we need to consider the man-child and the rest of the woman’s seed. </p>

<p data-content-id="MfMdlEkgq-a1uKaUUALpAADpFdySi1TRfcVofpiZYMm5RgH8fZWaM9MIilSy8MI87"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107207" data-verses="Revelation 12:2">Verse 2</span> says that the woman was with child, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107208" data-verses="Revelation 12:5">verse 5</span> says that “she brought forth a son, a man-child.” The child here, being a man-child, signifies the stronger part of God’s people. Although in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107209" data-verses="Revelation 12:2">verse 2</span> this child was in the woman, the Word does not call him a baby but a man-child. By reading and praying over this portion of the Word, we realize that <span class="pg" data-page-id="420" id="420">[420]</span> man-child here does not indicate a baby. Rather, it indicates the stronger part within the woman. The woman represents the totality of God’s people. But throughout all generations there have been some stronger ones among God’s people. These are considered in the Bible as a collective unit fighting the battle for God and bringing God’s kingdom down to earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="VhFuMszWUIGfHaNO9f-JJEZi_seXfav8VFEUjiuPmuf7Nx9BJILWDFG-eqZg1kGdt"> History proves that not everyone among God’s people is a strong one. No, only a minority of God’s people are strong ones. This was true during the time of the patriarchs. Do you not believe that during Noah’s time there were others who belonged to God besides Noah? I believe that God had hundreds of people. Noah, however, was a strong one. During the time of Israel, there were hundreds of thousands who belonged to God, but only a few of them were strong. For example, Elijah and Jeremiah were strong ones. Undoubtedly, the majority of God’s people were genuine, but they were not strong. We find the same thing in the New Testament. Although there were thousands of Christians in the early days, not that many were truly strong. Even at present there are thousands, even millions, of Christians, but not many are strong. I encourage you all to be strong. </p>
<p data-content-id="i6aa50jw_pYma5-9kQwhXnKKjpQo9jyWJhSG5jnjgpmh3Z1pRGRhjjd60ipXtg60s"> We should not only be part of the woman but also part of the man-child. In the Bible woman signifies the weaker one, and man signifies the stronger one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107210" data-verses="1Peter 3:7">1 Pet. 3:7</span>). The man-child, the stronger part, is within the woman, the weaker part. Although the woman is bright and universal, she is not altogether strong. Only a part within her is strong. This is true in the local churches, even here in Anaheim. Not all those in Anaheim are strong ones. Rather, I believe that in Anaheim there are more weak ones than strong ones. How about your locality? Everywhere the strong ones are few, and the weak ones are many. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gvNTj0qyHK7fxM7muDqwkXAB8G1IcIvbfrgDct-kby-g5UvD45-QA3Mzygn6Yx6f"> There is a proverb that says that if we do not have quantity, we can never have quality. Quality comes out of quantity. Suppose God had a hundred thousand people. If one percent of this number were strong ones, then there would be one thousand strong ones. Firstly, we have quantity, then quality. <span class="pg" data-page-id="421" id="421">[421]</span> God’s way is always wise. Firstly, He gains the quantity. He calls many but chooses few. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107211" data-verses="Matthew 22:14">Matthew 22:14</span> says, “Many are called, but few are chosen.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Np0A3NXGY9sb0kEPalq_4D5FwA7cx7DsiVnvh4Vd3iry7xMwdQWdiN4zotccxw5rB"> Although we all have come into the Lord’s recovery, we should not say that everyone in the recovery will be an overcomer. We have no warrant for saying this. We can only say that those in the recovery have a greater possibility of being overcomers. Whether or not you will be an overcomer depends upon you; it depends upon how much you share of God’s grace. How much you share of God’s grace will determine whether or not you will be a strong one among God’s people in the Lord’s recovery. I thank the Lord that we all are part of the woman, but I dare not say that we all are also part of the man-child. We must look to the Lord that we may be enriched, strengthened, and become more solid so that we might grow from the woman into her stronger part. But no matter how strong you become, do not prematurely separate yourself from the woman. If you do that, you will have a miscarriage. Be careful not to be “too strong.” If you are too strong, you will come out of the woman too soon. Stay in the woman as part of the man-child until the time of delivery has come. </p>
<p data-content-id="tICK0kqpdw83viGh_xTywHd_aoxXvWog1o4YjOZhdjbM1vmCFYdIuEXfD_WST4Dgf"> How can we be the man-child? If you would be part of the man-child, you must eat more, grow more, and become stronger. To put it into practical terms, you must pray more, spend more time with the Lord, eat more of the Word, experience the Lord more, grow in life more, and have more dealings with the negative things. If others would gossip, you would not gossip. If others would not pray, you would pray more. Although you should not be separate from the woman, you should be somewhat different from others. The woman is too general. Those who are part of the man-child are somewhat particular. Many of the dear ones in the Lord’s recovery are indifferent. They have little appetite and do not like to eat very much. But if you would be in the man-child, you should not be indifferent. You must be particular, sober, and serious. You must have a good appetite and have a personal, direct, moment-by-moment dealing with the <span class="pg" data-page-id="422" id="422">[422]</span> Lord. If you are like this, then it is possible that you will be the stronger part in the Lord’s recovery, the stronger part within the woman. Whether or not you will be in the man-child depends upon how you react to God’s desire, God’s move, and God’s eternal economy. If, day and night, you cannot go on until you have given yourself wholly and thoroughly to God’s economy, then it is likely that you are a part of the man-child. </p>
<p data-content-id="hhHSRpGa6c8nmBYQbhmi3QAUARIvvpnv3LkGuqyF8VwAmEhhWitCawAl83I6gzdpk"> Not only the Lord’s economy but even His recovery today depends upon the stronger ones, not upon the indifferent ones. There might be thousands in the Lord’s recovery, but not all are strong ones. Praise the Lord for the strong ones. The Lord’s recovery today absolutely depends upon them. Not all those in the Lord’s recovery in the United States are strong. Some say, “Oh, I love the Lord’s recovery, but I just can’t make it.” Such a one means business and loves the Lord’s recovery, but he is not absolute. Thank the Lord for the honest and faithful ones. They are absolute, saying, “This is it! I will be absolutely for it. I don’t like to be neutral.” We should be either cold or boiling hot, but not lukewarm. If we are lukewarm, we are only good for being vomited out of the Lord’s mouth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107212" data-verses="Revelation 3:16">Rev. 3:16</span>). </p>

Throughout the centuries, there has been war between the woman and the serpent. Actually, the battle has not been fought by the woman but by the man-child. This chapter covers all the generations from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107269" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span> until the end of this age. But it especially gives a more detailed portrait of Satan’s activity during the last three and a half years. This warfare began in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107270" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>, and it will consummate in the last three and a half years. The woman with the man-child and the serpent, which has become the great dragon, will fight until the time of the resurrection of the dead overcomers. When all the dead overcomers are resurrected as one entity, the man-child will come into full existence. This single entity, the stronger part of God’s people, will be raptured before the great tribulation, not to the air but to the throne of God. After the rapture of the man-child, there will be the final three and a half years, or the twelve hundred sixty days. </p>
<p data-content-id="6gUudY5_FgkP0IWCRfIYS9bkqigOoC5MuZnMLKGfCY9m8DxWQTymsdYcJHe9YM_1B"> After the man-child has been raptured to the throne of God, there will be war in the heavens. This indicates that the overcoming saints will exert a great influence upon the coming warfare in the heavens. This war will not begin until the overcoming saints have been resurrected and raptured. After this, there will be war between Satan and his angels and Michael, the archangel, and his angels. (Before Satan fell, he was also an archangel.) After the man-child has been raptured to the throne, there will no longer be any place <span class="pg" data-page-id="436" id="436">[436]</span> there for the dragon. Rather, the dragon will be defeated and cast down to the earth. When he comes to earth, the great tribulation will begin. During this period of time, the dragon will do everything possible to damage the man created by God for His purpose. Because up until now God has not yet gained the man-child, He has not had a way to cast Satan from heaven to earth. God needs a corporate man to accomplish this for Him. </p>

When Satan has been cast down to earth, he will cause great damage to the woman, who will still be on earth. In this message we need to consider the great red dragon and his persecution. </p>

During the last three and a half years, Satan will oppose that part of God’s people who will be left on the earth during the great tribulation. </p>
<p data-content-id="KieXqJ7jgoER4UdfBfZNeFTK3i3-vOBh6wo2bjONxSaxFCktk5VChNS7qxKtiNlUj"> Do not accept the wrong teaching that all Christians will be raptured before the great tribulation. There is no verse that teaches this. I have been studying this matter of rapture for over fifty years. In my study I have learned that the deep, sound Christian teachers agree that it is wrong to say that all Christians will be raptured before the great tribulation and that no believers will pass through the great <span class="pg" data-page-id="439" id="439">[439]</span> tribulation. This concept is a wrong teaching. If you accept it, you may be left in the great tribulation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107290" data-verses="Revelation 12:5">Revelation 12:5</span> we see that the man-child will be caught up to God before the last three and a half years. After the rapture of the man-child, the remainder of the woman’s seed, including the Jews who keep the commandments of God and the Christians who have the testimony of Jesus, will be left on earth. On the one hand, the man-child will be raptured before the three and a half years, and on the other hand, the seed of the woman, including both Jews and Christians, will be left to pass through most of the great tribulation. After Satan has been cast down to earth, he will do his best to persecute God’s people who are still on earth after the rapture of the man-child. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="FrpbcRt3yRk0Uxjm1URW7Eg08jGMgO4pTrxPj1VjX3CdPg4WUZDe1ebWLRh8zhLuo">WAR IN HEAVEN</h1><p data-content-id="Cs3ONxeMth5mwllbyYf4lOgkOx19rIDV8RSd8O8Hqv0o7uTpEdoOJ6dbZT0nyJr-e"> I am burdened that we would all see the vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107327" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation chapter twelve</span>. Do not think that the portrait here is a small picture showing a few insignificant matters. No, it is a great vision regarding what is taking place in the entire universe. The woman in this vision has been representing the people of God since the fall of man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107328" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>. The woman not only represents God’s people but also God Himself. In front of the woman is a dragon signifying God’s enemy. Throughout the centuries, the war has been between the woman and the serpent, the dragon. </p>
<p data-content-id="P8jMkwpkLdBOj0p4O-2xBwjyIUkf01sfuCHBwhorQzQcIaMpTU1ljj4-xfrJokpi-"> This vision unveils the true situation in the universe. The worldly people can see only the obvious outward things: commerce, politics, industry, education, war. If you ask them the meaning of all this, they would say that they do not know. They only know to obtain an education so that they may have a good job to earn a good living. They do not have the vision of what is taking place in the universe. But we see clearly what is going on. A woman symbolizes God’s people and represents God. In a positive sense, the wife always represents her husband. If your wife does not represent you properly, you will be shameful. But it is wonderful to have a wife to represent you in a good way. This signifies that we, the people of God, are His wife and that we need to represent Him adequately. God is the unique husband, and we, the unique wife, represent Him. But God has an enemy. Firstly, this enemy was a little serpent. Eventually, however, it became a great dragon who is now in front of us. If you do not have this vision, you will be blind, not knowing what is taking place on earth or in the universe. Praise the Lord that it is not simply a matter of education, industry, commerce, <span class="pg" data-page-id="448" id="448">[448]</span> diplomacy, etc., but a matter of warfare between the people of God and God’s enemy. This war has been raging throughout the centuries, and it is still raging today. </p>
<p data-content-id="-m2NLiiFqCHFHE8nxPFGHsCUatFPS_l0yGcvkTVWCVV_Epm3QfZFd6BUh2KJg6mtY"> We all must be aware of the fight between the woman and the dragon. Actually, it is not the woman who fights but the stronger part within her. Of those in the Lord’s recovery, some belong to this stronger part. This stronger part must bear the responsibility to fight the battle. The way to fight is by praying. Through the past four messages the dragon has been exposed, and now he is naked. Hallelujah, we know what and who he is, and we know what his destination will be. We all need to preach to Satan about this. This will terrify him. </p>
<p data-content-id="p1fZ6JpTsfZKO6kKI7TE51_R7Vr9jFaPuaeKh7AA1i31cpyLjD9mnBPgq5VXps5uw"> Most Christians mainly see that man fell, that God so loved the world and sent His only begotten Son to be the Savior, and that sinners need to hear the gospel, repent, and be forgiven of their sins and saved, so that one day they will go to heaven. But we must see something higher. The book of Revelation unveils a universal scene, a universal view. It is not simply that man has fallen—it is that God’s enemy is fighting against Him. In His economy God has selected a people to be a glorious woman. Once we were sinners, but now we are part of this glorious woman. Before I was saved, I was a poor sinner, but after I was regenerated, I became a part of the glorious woman. Look at how bright she is. In her there is no darkness at all. With her, everything is light—the light of the sun, the moon, and the stars. In front of this glorious woman is a blood-shedding, murderous dragon. We have no choice except to fight against him. But according to the vision, the whole woman does not fight; the stronger part within her does the fighting against the dragon. </p>

BECAUSE OF THE MAN-CHILD’S<br/>RAPTURE TO HEAVEN</h2><p data-content-id="Wg7ThGFRgCC6wAt8IVPuOma0I7UvKK0qES7VfaycMTRB5rcUso_47aspsnn4s6CTX"> There will be war in heaven because of the man-child’s rapture to heaven. Many Christians have a poor concept of the rapture, thinking that rapture is merely for the purpose of giving them a happy time, of taking them to a pleasant <span class="pg" data-page-id="449" id="449">[449]</span> place. The rapture is not only for us; it is for God’s economy and for God’s strategy. God’s enemy is still in the heavens. This enemy has been judged, and his sentence has been pronounced, but during the past nineteen centuries God has not had those who could execute His sentence upon the enemy. Satan, the enemy of God, was judged by the Lord Jesus on the cross (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107329" data-verses="John 12:31">John 12:31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107330" data-verses="John 16:11">16:11</span>). Following that, there is the need of the overcoming believers to carry out that judgment, to execute that sentence. The fighting waged by the overcoming believers against Satan is actually the execution of the Lord’s judgment upon him. Eventually, through their fighting, he will be cast out of heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107331" data-verses="Revelation 12:9">Rev. 12:9</span>). Who will go to heaven to execute God’s judgment and command the condemned, judged, and sentenced enemy to depart? The angels will not do this, for they are not qualified. The angels lack the position to do this because, being angels, they are on the same level as Satan who formerly was among them. God needs a man to accomplish this. This man has a Head—the man Jesus. He is the Head of the man-child, the Pioneer of all the overcomers. God needs such a man to execute His sentence upon Satan. God has been waiting a long time for this man. Although God does not have him yet, one day He will have him. </p>
<p data-content-id="1bH1BoKDaRAJxyi_xbCD4VJbQiTC27bryd7u8eD4YJle8aJWRrCBJAh3feyA9YqSH"> We must be raptured to the heavens to fulfill God’s need. We should not care that much for our own happiness. To care for our happiness is a Babylonian concept. This is also the concept of Catholicism derived from Babylonianism and resembling Buddhism. Religion is for human happiness, for having a good life in a merry land after we die. This thought is devilish. But, alas, this concept has infiltrated all of Christianity. Christians only care for their happiness, saying, “We like to have joy and a happy life. We want to go to heaven when we die, for we shall be happy there.” In Christianity you probably never heard that God has an eternal purpose and that we must fulfill God’s purpose. We need to be raptured to heaven, not for our happiness but for the fulfilling of God’s purpose. We must go there to execute God’s judgment upon His enemy. God is waiting for this. <span class="pg" data-page-id="450" id="450">[450]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="9rVdP9OOQSCrvWwNpNEghXtIScfMUbnsp2Q1i322XjDbKlbCI5SwCkdRWdaVi_g0k">A. The Overcomers Having Fought unto Death against Satan on Earth</h2><p data-content-id="jA4s3Ofm8UagYZF7i1Vjw0XMoIWabysDNDcRyxqadYigZpP5BmO3xTrtY6N7RJdCR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107332" data-verses="Revelation 12:7">Verse 7</span> says, “And there was war in heaven.” Immediately after the man-child is raptured to heaven, a war commences with Michael and his angels against Satan. This indicates that the man-child, the stronger part of God’s people, is always engaged in fighting God’s enemy, Satan. The overcomers have been fighting Satan continually, even unto death, and have defeated him on earth. But heaven is still waiting for them to arrive there so that a war may be waged to cast Satan out of heaven. </p>
<p data-content-id="Te69zzil3D0-mAl8PfN896MAFTuo9Kaxc7b0VET_-Yefo8dz0ktoThHUcteAt6Rr5"> The Lord has shown us the most effective way to defeat the enemy. What we need to do is to take the covenant, the word of God, and preach to Satan regarding what the Lord has accomplished for us. For example, whenever we were troubled by our temper in the past, we firstly confessed it, then asked the Lord for forgiveness, prayed to the Lord to help us, and finally made up our mind never to lose our temper again. I experienced this many times. But we should not do this anymore. When our temper is aroused, we should forget it and preach to Satan. Go to the source of the problem—Satan—and preach to him, saying, “Satan, you have been crucified on the cross.” The more you preach to Satan, the more you will be released. </p>

Later I spent a great deal of time to study this book. I eventually came to realize that the Bible cannot be understood simply by studying its language. If we would understand the Scriptures, we also need experience. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Xi707fcPG3tgdRrB8u8nSWR78lOqQB6y3SAVJIWn_neLMO9oHqhEzON_RcU2wxzw1">THE NEED OF EXPERIENCE</h2><p data-content-id="kJtprzMv-iEybgkzNyzDTDV_H6HZwpPsrUhhtuCMESGHnnFsJwP3wtj5eeGMBki0p"> Let us consider, for example, the matter of the pillars in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107361" data-verses="1Kings 7:13-22">1 Kings 7:13-22</span>. In message eighty-three of the Life-study of Genesis, I pointed out that the height of each of the two pillars, which was eighteen cubits, was half of three complete units of twelve cubits. I did not get this point from a commentary. Rather, I read various versions of the Bible in order to obtain the correct understanding of the language concerning all the points related to the building of the pillars. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107362" data-verses="2Chronicles 3:15">Second Chronicles 3:15</span> says that the height of the pillars was a total of thirty-five cubits. Immediately I asked myself, “Why does <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107363" data-verses="1Kings 7:15">1 Kings 7:15</span> say that the height of each pillar was eighteen cubits, but <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107364" data-verses="2Chronicles 3:15">2 Chronicles 3:15</span> says that the height of both was thirty-five cubits?” I could immediately see that this thirty-five cubits was the total height of both pillars. This confirms my saying that eighteen cubits was half of three complete units. But the total should have been thirty-six. What about the missing cubit? By a note in one version I was helped to conclude that the joint in the capitals no doubt accounts for the missing cubit. The whole pillar measured eighteen cubits, but half a cubit was lost in the joint between the pillar and the capital. In order to gain the <span class="pg" data-page-id="460" id="460">[460]</span> proper understanding, we need to study various versions of the Bible. But the versions of the Bible do not give us the significance in life. In order to know this, we must have experience. Only by experience could I apprehend that eighteen cubits indicate half of three complete units and that we need others to match us. </p>
<p data-content-id="J-GpZUZ4kVBIvd5R8J1AINvarikqWRQAjWB7RQPvz7P22_9iz4SIUft-9nE0gzGry"> With this in mind, let us now come to the book of Revelation. We all agree that Revelation is a book of prophecy. But to understand prophecy there is still the need of experience. The prophecies do not simply teach objective doctrines. The Bible is a book of life. Everything in the Bible, whether it is a narrative, a history, a type, a shadow, a prophecy, or a plain word, must be related to life. If we lack the experience in life, we shall be unable to apprehend the significance in life of many portions of the Word. In order to understand Revelation, we need the experiences in life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="zZdlZsx_Xy-tGxScyNm6rM6fHmkfBxIMErtkQIYPSIs0hDew6MtdTE2PZ2QGnjo-X">THE BRIGHT WOMAN<br/>BEING THE TOTALITY OF GOD’S PEOPLE</h2><p data-content-id="aW2aGRh_13sA-UYZ1egivQxgtDmN9maxrWvBvRqb8eU43xPKWs7vx4JzgzkzVkyZK"> In this message I am burdened to share more concerning the universal bright woman. Some of the expositions of the book of Revelation say that this woman is Israel. Of course, they have a ground to say this. When Brother Nee was very young, in the years before 1933, he conducted a study of this book. At that time, he followed the concept that the woman in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107365" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span> was Israel. However, afterward he saw something further—that this woman signifies God’s chosen people (see <em>The Glorious Church,</em> pp. 69-73). As I have pointed out, this woman is neither Mary, the mother of Jesus, nor merely the children of Israel. She is the totality of God’s people. When I was in Taiwan, I did not use the expression “the totality of God’s people.” This utterance has come to me during this last period of my ministry. Some may ask, “How can you prove that this woman is the totality of God’s people?” I have said that in order to understand this book we must check whether our apprehension of it corresponds to our life experience. Is there any confirmation from our life experience of a particular interpretation? If we <span class="pg" data-page-id="461" id="461">[461]</span> would rightly interpret the woman in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107366" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span>, we must check any proposed interpretation with our experience in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="_noypB0hbJEfWHQeKjQt1I5FIsunLX4z0lpvsRzPJX5yPZ5jO8HOWpyV1bAQCiwoF"> To say that this woman is Mary, the mother of Jesus, is altogether too objective and has nothing to do with our experience. If this is the case, then the entire twelfth chapter of Revelation is not for us. It is merely an account of a woman named Mary who brought forth Jesus and later suffered persecution. If this were the proper understanding of the woman in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107367" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">chapter twelve</span>, then, as far as we are concerned, this chapter has no purpose. What would be the point of its being included in the book of Revelation? This interpretation is groundless and, according to the experience of life, has no standing whatever. It is somewhat an improvement to say that this woman is Israel. But even if she were merely Israel, she would not be related to us, for this chapter would then simply be a record of Satan’s fighting against the children of Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="BM6WPQDgbT__QB93oHAQLnlac901sxHXBIVTiOGoM8gwQ4MS1D6UUKO84G9MHWJh_"> I would remind you that the book of Revelation, composed of twenty-two chapters, is divided into two main sections of eleven chapters each. The first section gives a complete sketch of the events from Christ’s ascension unto eternity. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107368" data-verses="Revelation 4:1">chapter four</span> we see the scene in heaven after the ascension of Christ, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107369" data-verses="Revelation 11:1">chapter eleven</span> we see the eternal kingdom. While the first section affords a general sketch, the second section gives the details of some important things and crucial matters which transpire during the period of time between Christ’s ascension and eternity future. At the very beginning of this second section, we have the first of these important and crucial matters—a bright woman opposed by a red dragon. Just as the second section begins with a woman, so at the ending, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107370" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">chapter twenty-two</span>, we also see a woman. Hence, both the first and last crucial matters are a woman. This is significant. </p>
<p data-content-id="xsF1VTQ6uNmvQ0gsEZfYs9IbISoTEAFzV_mWIqnjliKoXml2ZS6zTzBkq4NzheEv5"> Who is this woman? If we look at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107371" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">chapter twelve</span> with a narrow view, we may think she is Mary or the nation of Israel. But if we have a broad view which encompasses a wide span, we shall see that she is not Mary or merely the <span class="pg" data-page-id="462" id="462">[462]</span> nation of Israel but the totality of God’s people. If we have a panoramic view, we shall say, “This woman is not Mary or even the nation of Israel. She must be all the people chosen and saved by God for His economy.” Once you have this realization, you will begin to see that the stars indicate the patriarchs, that the moon under her feet must signify those under the law, and that the sun must represent the church people. Such an understanding fills our entire view and causes us to say, “This woman is certainly a universal woman, including all the people from the patriarchs to the last member of Christ’s Body.” This understanding is confirmed by the vision of the woman at the end of Revelation, where we see that the New Jerusalem is the wife of the Lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107372" data-verses="Revelation 21:9">21:9</span>), composed of both the Old Testament saints, represented by the names of the twelve tribes, and the New Testament saints, represented by the names of the twelve apostles. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="rFrCGjzy0s3seaoP5ZFz1WE5fCMBGuZn7QPczLYQpR6KGf-mSZlvxLAT6G-4WlYEl">THE CONTENT OF THE SECOND SECTION<br/>OF REVELATION</h2><p data-content-id="dqTRyG6GA884EmjvR4UyOegfOKxGUKNc9pTPOwHALeZwBCUtG7wCY77G5UKUOOnaQ"> What is between these two ends of the second section of Revelation? In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107373" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">chapters twenty-one and twenty-two</span> we have the New Jerusalem as the Lamb’s wife, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107374" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">chapters nineteen and twenty</span> we have the bride and the wedding feast of the Lamb. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107375" data-verses="Revelation 20:1">chapter twenty</span> the bride will be those reigning with Christ during the thousand years. Hence in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107376" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">chapters nineteen and twenty</span> the woman is the bride, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107377" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">chapters twenty-one and twenty-two</span> she is the wife. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107378" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">chapters seventeen and eighteen</span> we see Babylon the Great, the counterfeit of this woman, the counterfeit of Jerusalem. This view is not only logical but also very meaningful. </p>

The fact that the dragon stands on the sand of the sea and the fact that the holy city, Jerusalem, will be trampled under foot forty-two months (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107402" data-verses="Revelation 11:2">11:2</span>) indicate that Satan’s persecution in the great tribulation will be carried out mainly in the land of Israel. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107408" data-verses="Daniel 8:1">chapter eight</span> a little horn comes out of one of the four horns of the goat, and something also issues from the northern king in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107409" data-verses="Daniel 11:1">chapter eleven</span>.

According to this chapter, seventy weeks have been assigned by God in the history of Israel. Each week denotes a period of seven years. After the sixty-ninth week, a prince, who was Titus, came to destroy Jerusalem, and Jerusalem was trodden under the feet of the Gentiles. During that time, the desolation came with the abomination (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107427" data-verses="Daniel 9:27">Dan. 9:27</span>). In A.D. 70 Titus destroyed the city of Jerusalem. From that time until 1967 Jerusalem was under Gentile control. The return of Jerusalem to the Jews in 1967 is an indication that we are very close to the end time. Through Antichrist the desolation with the abomination will soon come in full. </p>

<p data-content-id="38DbLjkjfrpGOnLvrDZzvLBG3m0AD03T0zpiuZ_ALgyZ1yVY5W1UVpbk1LrYnnGZ3"> Antichrist is also the prince in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107505" data-verses="Daniel 9:26-27">Daniel 9:26-27</span>. If you read this chapter carefully, you will see that the prince refers to two people. Firstly, it refers to Titus who, with the Roman army, destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. That destruction was the fulfillment of the Lord’s prophecy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107506" data-verses="Luke 21:1">Luke 21</span>. In His last visit to Jerusalem, the Lord prophesied to His disciples that Jerusalem would be destroyed and that the temple would be torn down, with not one stone left upon another. That prophecy was fulfilled less than forty years after the Lord’s death. According to history, that destruction was terrible. Titus, however, was a shadow of the coming prince, Antichrist, and the destruction of Jerusalem under Titus was simply a shadow of the coming destruction of Jerusalem and the temple under Antichrist. Between these two men who share one title, “the prince,” there is an interval of approximately two thousand years. </p>

These seventy weeks are not weeks of days, but weeks of years. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107508" data-verses="Daniel 9:25">Daniel 9:25</span> says, “Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="482" id="482">[482]</span> The seven weeks mentioned here are reckoned from the time the decree was issued by the Persian king to rebuild the city of Jerusalem. From the time this decree was issued until the rebuilding of the city was a period of forty-nine years. The sixty-two weeks are the period from the completion of the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the day of Christ’s crucifixion. The crucifixion of Christ is referred to in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107509" data-verses="Daniel 9:26">Daniel 9:26</span>, which says, “And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself.” Hence, from the completion of the rebuilding of the city to the crucifixion of the Messiah was four hundred thirty-four years. Therefore, of the seventy weeks mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107510" data-verses="Daniel 9:1">Daniel 9</span>, only the last one remains. </p>
<p data-content-id="OPc0C_l9lbNcoMQBRuTefKizOpZFY1ZNF3gAaE0-NZcyLxO2KT0pWsR4uiaTts0_i"> After the crucifixion of Christ, Titus destroyed the city of Jerusalem. Between the time of the crucifixion of Christ and the beginning of the seventieth week is a gap of unknown duration. This interval has already been more than nineteen hundred years. This gap has encompassed the ancient Roman Empire, which expired in A.D. 476, and the Roman Church, which replaced the Roman Empire. It will also include the revived Roman Empire. The last Caesar of the revived Roman Empire will be Antichrist, who will make a covenant with the Jews for one week. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107511" data-verses="Daniel 9:27">Daniel 9:27</span> says, “And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week.” In this covenant Antichrist will promise the Jews the liberty to worship God according to their religion. </p>

This breaking of the covenant will occur at a crucial time, at the time Satan is cast down to earth and stands on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea to stir up Antichrist. Antichrist will then exalt himself above all gods. He may say, “You Jews must not worship your God anymore. I am God! I command you to stop your sacrifices and to abolish your religious feasts. Furthermore, I will change <span class="pg" data-page-id="483" id="483">[483]</span> your laws. You must forget everything about your God, the law of your God, and your feasts and turn to worship me.” At the time Antichrist exalts himself above all gods, he will also pollute the temple. </p>

Antichrist will bring in both abominations or idols, and desolation or destruction, demolishing both the temple and the city of Jerusalem. This is the proper understanding of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107515" data-verses="Daniel 9:25-27">Daniel 9:25-27</span>. If we have this understanding, we shall see how Antichrist will deal with the Jews. </p>
<p data-content-id="cgfMaJYFAO1mOpI22kRdhJ3KeaFLUVAHK7fr4_AyvD4ITdSSCh7v-cnqPDc7CCaPG"> When we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107516" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">Revelation chapter seventeen</span>, we shall see that Antichrist will destroy Catholicism in addition to Judaism. Both Judaism and Catholicism have become abominable in the eyes of God. Although some of us were formerly in one or the other, we praise the Lord that we are no longer in these “isms.” We are now in Christ. For centuries, these two “isms” have been abominable in the eyes of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107517" data-verses="Revelation 2:9">2:9</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107518" data-verses="Revelation 3:9">3:9</span> the Lord Jesus called the Jewish synagogues the “synagogue of Satan.” Furthermore, the Lord Jesus revealed to the apostle John that Catholicism is the great prostitute (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107519" data-verses="Revelation 17:1-6">17:1-6</span>). Some may argue, “How can you call the Jewish synagogues the synagogue of Satan? In a synagogue the Jews worship God and study the Scriptures.” But I was not the one who said that the synagogue is the synagogue of Satan—this was the word of the Lord Jesus to His church. It was no longer God but Satan who was in the synagogue. Others, defending Catholicism, may say, “Doesn’t the Catholic Church preach Christ?” But Catholicism preaches Christ as the son of Mary. The worship of Mary comes from paganism. The Mary in Catholicism, who is called “the mother of God,” is another form of the goddess, Venus. This is demonic. <span class="pg" data-page-id="484" id="484">[484]</span> Christmas is also demonic, for December 25, the date of a pagan festival in honor of the birth of the sun, is said to be the birthday of Christ. What blasphemy! Although everything in Catholicism has a Christian appearance, its source is Babylonianism. For this reason, in God’s eyes the Catholic Church is the great prostitute who enriches herself by committing spiritual fornication. Therefore, the Catholic Church is called the great prostitute. Both Judaism and Catholicism are Satanic. Under Satan’s instigation, Antichrist will destroy Judaism and Catholicism. He will do this destroying work without realizing that he is doing it for God and for Christ. Over all this, God is sovereign. Antichrist will do all these things in the process of exalting himself above every kind of god, abolishing every religion, and making himself the sole object of worship. </p>

Antiochus opposed the holy covenant God had made with His people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107527" data-verses="Daniel 11:28">Dan. 11:28</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107528" data-verses="Daniel 11:30">30</span>) and took away the <span class="pg" data-page-id="485" id="485">[485]</span> continual sacrifice (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107529" data-verses="Daniel 11:31">Dan. 11:31</span>).

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107552" data-verses="Revelation 13:1">Revelation 13</span> he is simply called “the beast.” </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="tICK0kqpdw83viGh_xTywHd_dpxXmEog1o4YjOZhdjbM1vmCFYdIuEXfD_WST4Dgf">A. The Symbol of the Third Beast in Daniel 7</h2><p data-content-id="hhHSRpGa6c8nmBYQbhmi3QAUHQIvn73v3LkGuqyF8VwAmEhhWitCawAl83I6gzdpk"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107553" data-verses="Daniel 7:4-6">Daniel 7:4-6</span>, the leopard, whose characteristic is swift and cruel movement, was the symbol of Alexander the Great, the king of Greece. In a sense, a leopard is more fierce than a lion. The fact that the beast which John saw “was like a leopard” confirms our saying that Antichrist will be a Greek. Alexander the Great was a leopard, and Antichrist will also be like a leopard. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="-m2NLiiFqCHFHE8nxPFGHsCUdvlPVtF0yGcvkTVWCVV_Epm3QfZFd6BUh2KJg6mtY">B.

A bear <span class="pg" data-page-id="490" id="490">[490]</span> stamps and destroys with its feet. Antichrist will have this characteristic. </p>

Since this beast, Antichrist, is like the three other beasts and will have the characteristics of all three, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107555" data-verses="Daniel 7:4-7">Daniel 7:4-7</span>, he will be the totality of all evil powers in human history. Antichrist will have the characteristics of Alexander the Great, Darius, and Nebuchadnezzar. Although he will look like a leopard, his feet will be those of a bear and his mouth that of a lion. All the characteristics of all the wild beasts will be synthesized in this one person, making him the all-inclusive beast. Hence, he will be the ultimate issue and totality of all the worldly powers. If you study world history, you will see that Nebuchadnezzar devoured people, Darius stamped upon them, and Alexander the Great moved swiftly, seizing the entire empire in a very short period of time. Furthermore, Alexander was exceedingly cruel. All these characteristics prefigure the various features of Antichrist, who will certainly be an extraordinary figure. </p>
<p data-content-id="2dKAFOptUaVJ1O8CsbCZpWVpadnfeUbrD3ZULTjfRG56qNxhXho1DQvZyTnlBjLC6"> Do not think that Antichrist will be an ordinary person. No, he will be a very unusual man. Nearly forty years ago, some said that Mussolini was Antichrist. At that time, in 1936, I was already in my ministry and I was carefully observing the world situation. When we heard this claim, we immediately realized that Mussolini was not that powerful. Furthermore, he did not have the appearance of a leopard, but rather that of a frog. Whenever you hear a rumor that a certain man may be Antichrist, you must consider whether or not he possesses the characteristics of Antichrist. Ask whether he is like a leopard, a bear, and a lion. Inquire whether he is intellectually brilliant. Since we have seen the <span class="pg" data-page-id="491" id="491">[491]</span> light in the Scriptures regarding Antichrist, no one will be able to cheat us with respect to him. </p>

Geographically, this sea is the Mediterranean Sea, “the great sea” mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107557" data-verses="Daniel 7:2">Daniel 7:2</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="Huy9VfbmqOU-Xs8Ud1qttbqEaoo2jpC36RmXphwWDhi5Es85PdREqM_9KTAokR4Qe"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107558" data-verses="Revelation 9:11">9:11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107559" data-verses="Revelation 11:7">11:7</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107560" data-verses="Revelation 17:8">17:8</span> we are told that Antichrist will come up out of the abyss. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107561" data-verses="Revelation 13:1">13:1</span> we are told that he will come up out of the sea, as also mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107562" data-verses="Daniel 7:3">Daniel 7:3</span>. This indicates that Antichrist will come from two sources. His spirit, which has been kept in the abyss, will come up out of the abyss, and his body will come from one of the Gentile nations around the Mediterranean Sea. That Antichrist will come up out of both the abyss and the sea may also indicate that the sea is the mouth of the abyss, because the abyss is in the heart of the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107563" data-verses="Romans 10:7">Rom. 10:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107564" data-verses="Matthew 12:40">Matt. 12:40</span>), and the sea is above the earth. </p>

Symbolically, out of the Gentile World</h2><p data-content-id="kJtprzMv-iEybgkzNyzDTDV_A43Z07vsrUhhtuCMESGHnnFsJwP3wtj5eeGMBki0p"> In biblical figure, the land signifies the nation of Israel, and the sea signifies the Gentile nations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107565" data-verses="Revelation 17:15">17:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107566" data-verses="Isaiah 57:20">Isa. 57:20</span>). This indicates that Antichrist will come out of the Gentile world. Some expect Antichrist to arise in the Jewish territory or out of the Jewish people. But, as we have seen, in the Bible the Jewish territory is signified by the land and the Gentile world is signified by the sea. Since Antichrist will not come out of the land, but out of the sea, he cannot arise in Israel. Furthermore, we know that he will appear out of one of the four kingdoms of ancient Greece (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107567" data-verses="Daniel 8:8-9">Dan. 8:8-9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107568" data-verses="Daniel 8:21-23">21-23</span>). Because we have received this light regarding Antichrist, we should no longer listen to any loose interpretations. </p>

We all must pay attention to this. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="aW2aGRh_13sA-UYZ1egivQxgqBWN20KxrWvBvRqb8eU43xPKWs7vx4JzgzkzVkyZK">1.

This emphatically indicates that the coming Antichrist will be one with Satan. He will actually be the embodiment of Satan. Satan will be embodied in him and expressed through him, for Satan’s seven heads and ten horns will be the seven heads and ten horns of Antichrist. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="qFT3je7o6rEOFRguDp8CG0dTio6Y4N7v-CuesvcrtybeUNGaiOI26ePMHk72T6-ua">2. Ten Horns</h2><p data-content-id="yIistfmiI2_aDzgmmvCwMJLHCtoHU7DpV_WNoVoXfyhbv9uKSdjFfOREsc87szYIq"> What are these ten horns? Firstly, they are the ten kings in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107572" data-verses="Revelation 17:12">17:12</span> signified by the ten diadems on the ten horns. Secondly, they are the ten kingdoms symbolized by the ten toes of the great image in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107573" data-verses="Daniel 2:42-44">Daniel 2:42-44</span>. Remember that the ten kings are equal to the ten kingdoms represented by the ten toes of the image. With the image there are ten toes, and with the beast there are ten horns. The ten horns of the beast are equal to the ten toes of the image. Moreover, these ten toes are simultaneously the ten kingdoms. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="8xVo-B7NrMY0kPDgZqBD43ILNqL-S8Gwuq3Joqe2LOC9AD1rboXiIgCBQAwKW-c3U">3. Seven Heads</h2><p data-content-id="06HaLz-rodl0AfizE_p5q65Gpw--iwU5Vzf9t1pdh1RDT-1G6VyoGGe03xNQWK59K"> The seven heads of the beast are seven Caesars of the Roman Empire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107574" data-verses="Revelation 17:10">17:10</span>), signified by the seven diadems on the seven heads (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107575" data-verses="Revelation 12:3">12:3</span>). Altogether, the Roman Empire had twelve Caesars, but only seven figure in the prophecy in Revelation. The other five are not much involved. The first Caesar was Julius, the fifth, Nero, and the sixth, Domitian, who was Caesar when John wrote the book of Revelation. The seventh Caesar, who will eventually suffer a death blow and be resuscitated with the spirit of Nero, the fifth Caesar, will be Antichrist. At the present, Nero’s spirit is being held in the abyss. After the seventh Caesar has been killed and is about to be resuscitated, Nero’s spirit will be released from the abyss and will enter into the body of the seventh Caesar, <span class="pg" data-page-id="493" id="493">[493]</span> who will then be resuscitated to be the eighth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107576" data-verses="Revelation 17:10-11">17:10-11</span>). Although Antichrist will be the eighth, yet he will still be of the seventh and a part of the fifth. We shall consider this more thoroughly when we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107577" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">chapter seventeen</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="7_7f53lSdKfhS9KELOla9LykZ-e_FGEQZ68G2Q-ukinNeICCXYLfJ8k0uws0cEQC4"> The seven heads of the beast bear names of blasphemy. According to history, all seven Caesars claimed to be God, assumed deity, and forced their people to worship them as God. That was really blasphemous to God. This is what is signified by the names of blasphemy. </p>

<p data-content-id="9rVdP9OOQSCrvWwNpNEghXtIVevMQJXsp2Q1i322XjDbKlbCI5SwCkdRWdaVi_g0k"> When as a young man I studied the great image Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107610" data-verses="Daniel 2:28-35">Dan. 2:28-35</span>), I became fully convinced that the Bible is a divinely inspired book. The parts of the great image—the head, the breast and arms, the belly and thighs, and the legs with the ten toes—match the development of the worldly powers throughout the centuries. Besides God Himself, who could have given us such an illustration? We must believe that God has been and still is sovereign over all the world powers, having sovereignly prepared them in a certain way. How wonderful it is to see the world powers represented by the image of a human body. It is foolish not to believe that the Bible is a divine book. If we would understand the prophecies of this book, we must have divine wisdom. The more wisdom we have and the more we get into these prophecies, the more nourishment we shall derive from them. </p>
<p data-content-id="jA4s3Ofm8UagYZF7i1Vjw0XMvKmacgsDNDcRyxqadYigZpP5BmO3xTrtY6N7RJdCR"> There is rich nourishment to be gained from the prophecies in the Bible. However, many studies of prophecy merely touch things such as the seven heads, the ten horns, the ten toes, the three and a half years, the forty-two months, and the twelve hundred sixty days. This is like being given a bowl of chicken bones without any meat. But we should receive nourishment from the divine Word. To say that all Scripture is God-breathed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107611" data-verses="2Timothy 3:16">2 Tim. 3:16</span>) means every line of the Bible is the breath of God. In every line of Scripture, including these portions that are prophecies, there is some life element, some living nourishment. When we study prophecy, we should have meat as well as the bones. <span class="pg" data-page-id="500" id="500">[500]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Te69zzil3D0-mAl8PfN896MACReo7YKxc7b0VET_-Yefo8dz0ktoThHUcteAt6Rr5"> We have seen seven significant aspects of Antichrist: the fourth beast, the little horn, the prince, the king, the all-inclusive beast, the angel of the abyss, and the man of sin. Now in this message we need to consider several other important aspects of this extraordinary figure. </p>

When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was tempted in the wilderness by the devil. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107614" data-verses="Matthew 4:8-9">Matthew 4:8 and 9</span> say, “Again, the Devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory; and he said to Him, All these will I give You if You will fall down and worship me.” The Lord Jesus refused, saying, “Go, Satan! For it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107615" data-verses="Matthew 4:10">Matt. 4:10</span>). Since that day, Satan has been looking for someone to whom he could give all the power, authority, and glory of his satanic kingdom. He will find the one he has been seeking in the person of Antichrist. What the Lord Jesus rejected, Antichrist will receive. </p>
<p data-content-id="D08BEZDWCoGzl9aRgkuTZIQByFjk0_zSwTEtOAeTiI-pN0qDlIp5_x909EdoSb6yb"> Because Satan will give his power and authority to Antichrist, Antichrist will become an extraordinary person. His personality and character will be exceedingly strong. </p>

BEING KILLED AND RESUSCITATED</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="gmeJHU6Nz9bHbq5NUV6eCQpdIAUbNJgabNE5d2gHsrIOUvw44xUHcApdW5D5Qezd4">A.

<p data-content-id="eMGG8SZW5aKYwACjfS3uY0Bv4Mb8e7_pNMYqz5sYFrO7IjSJfZqHiVhS_6SOouZ-_"> Antichrist will be killed and resuscitated. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107616" data-verses="Revelation 13:3">Revelation 13:3</span> says, “And one of his heads was as if it had been slain to death, and his death stroke was healed.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107617" data-verses="Revelation 13:12">Verse 12</span> says that his “death stroke was healed,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107618" data-verses="Revelation 13:14">verse 14</span> says that the beast “had the stroke of the sword and lived.” “One of his <span class="pg" data-page-id="501" id="501">[501]</span> heads” refers to one of the Caesars who will be slain and resuscitated. The word about the healing of his death stroke refers to his resuscitation. After he has been resuscitated, the whole earth will marvel after him. Antichrist will probably be slain in the middle of the last seven years, perhaps about the same time Satan is cast down from heaven to earth. I say this because, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107619" data-verses="Revelation 9:1">Revelation 9:1</span>, the angel of the abyss emerges shortly after Satan, as the star, falls from heaven to earth. About this time, the seventh Caesar of the Roman Empire will be killed. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="5gvNTj0qyHK7fxM7muDqwkXAG9W1IdIvbfrgDct-kby-g5UvD45-QA3Mzygn6Yx6f">B. Resuscitated with the Spirit<br/>of the Fallen Fifth Caesar—Nero—<br/>to Be the Eighth Caesar</h2><p data-content-id="Np0A3NXGY9sb0kEPalq_4D5F3Brcx6DsiVnvh4Vd3iry7xMwdQWdiN4zotccxw5rB"> When Satan is cast down, the spirit of Caesar Nero will be released from the abyss and enter into the body of the slain seventh Caesar to resuscitate his corpse and to make him the eighth Caesar. This eighth Caesar will have the body of the seventh Caesar and the spirit of the fifth. This resuscitation will be a counterfeit of Christ’s resurrection. Anyone who does not have the faith of Christ will certainly be attracted by this miraculous occurrence. During the first half of the last seven years, the seventh Caesar will appear. After he has been slain and resuscitated, which will take place near the middle of these seven years, he will become the eighth Caesar. Hence, during the first three and a half years, he will be the seventh Caesar, and during the last three and a half years, he, as the resuscitated Antichrist, will be the eighth Caesar. The seventh Caesar will confirm a covenant with the Jews for seven years, and the eighth Caesar will persecute the Jews and exalt himself to be God. Thus the death and resuscitation of Antichrist will mark a great turn. In principle, it will almost be the same as with the death and resurrection of Christ. Before His death and resurrection, Christ was limited in His flesh, but after His death and resurrection, He was given all authority and power (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107620" data-verses="Matthew 28:18">Matt. 28:18</span>). Satan will attempt to counterfeit this in order to prove to the world that his Antichrist is the same as <span class="pg" data-page-id="502" id="502">[502]</span> Christ. Therefore, Antichrist will be two persons. During the time of his being the seventh Caesar, he will not be that marvelous, charming, and deceiving. But after his assassination and resuscitation, he will become a marvelous character. He will be charming, deceiving, alluring, and captivating. Only the saints who have the faith of Christ will be able to withstand his charm and deceitfulness. After his resuscitation, being indwelt by the spirit of Caesar Nero, he will become all the more capable, intelligent, and powerful. </p>
<p data-content-id="tICK0kqpdw83viGh_xTywHd_dphXvXog1o4YjOZhdjbM1vmCFYdIuEXfD_WST4Dgf"> We have seen that the slain and resuscitated Antichrist will have the name Caesar Nero. The false prophet will cause “all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107621" data-verses="Revelation 13:16">13:16</span>), and no one will be able to buy or sell unless he has “the mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107622" data-verses="Revelation 13:17">13:17</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107623" data-verses="Revelation 13:18">Revelation 13:18</span> says, “Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.” The false prophet will induce people to worship Antichrist. At the same time, he will devise a way to mark them either with the name of Antichrist or with the number of his name. This mark will be placed either on the forehead or on the right hand. Some students of the Bible have suggested that probably the men will be marked on their forehead and the women will be marked on their right hand. This mark will be the indication that the people bearing it belong to Caesar Nero. The number of the beast is “the number of a man,” Caesar Nero, the coming Antichrist. (See note 18<sup>2</sup> of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107624" data-verses="Revelation 13:1">Revelation 13</span>, Recovery Version.) Because the book of Revelation was written during the time of the Roman Empire, John did not mention the name of Nero, but indicated it with a number. Therefore, there is the need of wisdom to understand it. With the wisdom given by God we can determine that the number six hundred sixty-six denotes Caesar Nero. No other name gives us the exact number of six hundred sixty-six. </p>
<p data-content-id="hhHSRpGa6c8nmBYQbhmi3QAUHQYvvonv3LkGuqyF8VwAmEhhWitCawAl83I6gzdpk"> While the unbelievers will bear the name of Nero on their forehead or on their hand, testifying that they belong to <span class="pg" data-page-id="503" id="503">[503]</span> him, all the overcomers will have on their forehead the name of the Lamb and of the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107625" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">14:1</span>). There will be no neutrality. Either you will bear the name of God or the name of Caesar Nero, the embodiment of Satan. To bear the name of Caesar Nero means to belong to Satan, and to bear the name of God means to belong to God. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZwRw-sIjrvKZJVrX9K-LjtjuQgm2VzATTWw_AihsrUNSru4xxjkdO4VC6khkUMgY3">I. JUDAS ISCARIOT</h2><p data-content-id="ADcOpTWyGt901MiqV_ZKRV6F_OzPGsTaZ6KLGZIyWdC9Glu88RqQYZsBIACfYqBFW"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107656" data-verses="Revelation 13:11">Revelation 13:11</span> says, “And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth.” This beast is the false prophet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107657" data-verses="Revelation 16:13">16:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107658" data-verses="Revelation 19:20">19:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107659" data-verses="Revelation 20:10">20:10</span>). Since the earth, the land, signifies the nation of Israel, this beast, the false prophet, will come out of the Jewish nation. Some students of prophecy believe that the false prophet will be Judas Iscariot. I believe this view is correct. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107660" data-verses="Acts 1:25">Acts 1:25</span>, after his death Judas went “to his own place,” rather than to “his people,” as was the case with others recorded in Scripture (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107661" data-verses="Genesis 25:17">Gen. 25:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107662" data-verses="Genesis 35:29">35:29</span>). Although there have been many false persons in history, no one was as filled with Satan as Judas was. Jesus said, “Did not I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil? Now He spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, being one of the twelve, would betray Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107663" data-verses="John 6:70-71">John 6:70-71</span>). Here we see that the Lord Jesus even called Judas a devil. Because Judas was filled with the devil, he was one with the devil. No one other than Judas matches the description of the false prophet. </p>
<p data-content-id="FrpbcRt3yRk0Uxjm1URW7Eg07gGMkO4pTrxPj1VjX3CdPg4WUZDe1ebWLRh8zhLuo"> Let us consider further the significance of Judas’ going “to his own place.” According to the record in the Bible, Elijah was raptured to God, and the body of Moses was kept by God for a specific purpose. In addition, we have seen that the spirit of Nero is being kept in the abyss. Undoubtedly, the spirit of Judas is also being kept in a particular place. Only when we come to the book of Revelation do we see <span class="pg" data-page-id="510" id="510">[510]</span> why the Bible gives us this particular record of these four people. </p>
<p data-content-id="Cs3ONxeMth5mwllbyYf4lOgkJy19nIDV8RSd8O8Hqv0o7uTpEdoOJ6dbZT0nyJr-e"> During the time of the great tribulation, the Lord’s people on earth will need strengthening. Because God foreknew this, He has sovereignly kept Moses and Elijah for His testimony during that time. God is also keeping Nero and Judas, but, in contrast to Moses and Elijah, they are not in a pleasant place. One is in the abyss, and the other is in “his own place.” Although I do not know what this place is, I am confident that it is not a place of joy. Hence, two people have been kept by God for His positive purpose and two others have been kept for His negative purpose. The spirit of Nero is being held in the abyss until the time it will fully constitute the last Caesar of the Roman Empire as Antichrist. Judas is kept in his own place until he appears as the false prophet. By God’s sovereign keeping of these four people, we can see that the whole universe and the entire human race is under God’s sovereign hand. Nothing happens accidentally. Rather, everything takes place according to God’s sovereign arrangement. </p>
<p data-content-id="P8jMkwpkLdBOj0p4O-2xBwjyPXkf41sfuCHBwhorQzQcIaMpTU1ljj4-xfrJokpi-"> Centuries ago, God prepared Moses and Elijah. As we have pointed out, Moses represents the law, and Elijah, the prophets. In ancient times, the Jews referred to the Old Testament as “the law and the prophets.” Because Moses and Elijah are two witnesses, they have been purposely kept by God. One day, after Satan has been cast down to earth and embodied in Antichrist, who will exercise satanic power to persecute God’s people, God will send these two witnesses back to strengthen His people. At that time, Satan will call out Judas to work for him as he did once before. Just as the spirit of Nero will emerge from the abyss to become Antichrist, so Judas will come out of his own place to become the false prophet. Therefore, during the three and a half years of the great tribulation, four special persons will be on earth—Moses, Elijah, Nero, and Judas. Probably all four will meet one another face to face. I wonder what Moses and Elijah will say to Judas. Moses and Elijah will be the anti-testimony to Antichrist and the false prophet. Imagine <span class="pg" data-page-id="511" id="511">[511]</span> what a situation that will be when these four confront one another! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Huy9VfbmqOU-Xs8Ud1qttbqEapI2jrC36RmXphwWDhi5Es85PdREqM_9KTAokR4Qe">II. COMING UP OUT OF THE EARTH</h2><p data-content-id="Xi707fcPG3tgdRrB8u8nSWR77meqUTKy3SAVJIWn_neLMO9oHqhEzON_RcU2wxzw1"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107664" data-verses="Revelation 13:11">Revelation 13:11</span> says that the other beast, the false prophet, will come up out of the earth. Geographically, he will come from underneath the earth, and symbolically he will come from the nation of Israel. We have seen that the land signifies the nation of Israel. For this reason, the false prophet will certainly come out of the nation of Israel. He must be one of the Jewish people. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="kJtprzMv-iEybgkzNyzDTDV_A5XZ37PsrUhhtuCMESGHnnFsJwP3wtj5eeGMBki0p">III. HIS FALSEHOOD</h2><p data-content-id="J-GpZUZ4kVBIvd5R8J1AINvash0qQDAAjWB7RQPvz7P22_9iz4SIUft-9nE0gzGry"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107665" data-verses="Revelation 13:11">Revelation 13:11</span> says that the beast out of the earth “had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.” The false prophet looks like a lamb, but speaks like a dragon. This indicates his falsehood. In the Bible the lamb signifies Christ. The fact that the false prophet will have two horns like a lamb indicates that he will pretend to be the same as Christ. However, his speaking will be like the dragon, Satan. Although he will pretend to be like Christ, what he expresses will be like Satan. He will be an absolute falsehood. </p>
<p data-content-id="zZdlZsx_Xy-tGxScyNm6rM6fAl0fIioMErtkQIYPSIs0hDew6MtdTE2PZ2QGnjo-X"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107666" data-verses="Revelation 13:13">Verse 13</span> says, “And he does great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth before men.” The false prophet will employ satanic power to perform great signs. In calling down fire out of heaven, the false prophet will do the same thing Elijah did. Elijah called down fire from heaven during the days of Ahab (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107667" data-verses="1Kings 18:1">1 Kings 18</span>), and during the coming three and a half years of the great tribulation he will do this again. When Judas sees this, he may say, “If Elijah can do it, I can too.” Because the false prophet will perform great signs, it will be difficult for people to discern the real prophet from the false prophet. The false prophet will be able to do the same thing as the real one. As far as eloquence is concerned, Judas will likely be no less eloquent than Moses or Elijah because his speaking will be like that of the dragon. <span class="pg" data-page-id="512" id="512">[512]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="aW2aGRh_13sA-UYZ1egivQxgqA2N11qxrWvBvRqb8eU43xPKWs7vx4JzgzkzVkyZK"> If we have been enlightened, we would never pay attention to signs. According to the concept of the New Testament, the Lord does not intend for us to devote our attention to signs. Rather, we must concentrate our whole being on the matter of life. We should not care for what a preacher or minister can do in the way of signs; we must examine the kind of life he has. It is not a matter of the power we exercise, but of the life we live. If you care only for life, you will never be deceived. As far as signs are concerned, there is no way to discern the true from the false, for both Elijah and the false prophet will bring down fire from heaven. The only way to discern is by life. If both Elijah and Judas were standing before you, you could easily discern who is true and who is false by their very being. People may cheat others by their words, but they expose themselves by what they are. Do not care for what people can do—care for what they are. Today most Christians do not care for what people are, but for what they can do. They care for power, signs, and miracles. But those who exercise miraculous power to do signs may have a living and behavior that are deplorable. I am not saying that we should be concerned with our outward appearance. I am saying that we must be what we are. What we are in our living must express what we are in our life. The life we live out from within expresses, not what we can do, but what we are. </p>
<p data-content-id="by2v23Nedf13WGfghX9I29Vrowl_sTRCOuCyECvjxyFHKSsKwXMqeaZkYrTMh3eTi"> At the end time, the signs, powers, and miracles will come. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107668" data-verses="Matthew 24:24">Matthew 24:24</span> the Lord Jesus said, “False Christs and false prophets shall arise and shall show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107669" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:9-10">2 Thessalonians 2:9 and 10</span> Paul said the Antichrist, the man of sin, would come “according to the operation of Satan, with all power and signs and wonders of a lie, and with all deceit of unrighteousness among those who are perishing.” We must be warned not to look for signs and wonders. If you do, you may be deceived. Instead of seeking signs, we must care for Christ in the way of life. Do not expect miracles—give your attention to life, which is Christ Himself. <span class="pg" data-page-id="513" id="513">[513]</span> When Judas, the false prophet, appears, he will deceive people by the signs he performs. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107679" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span> we all have been impressed with the vision of the woman with her stronger part, the man-child, fighting against the enemy by means of the word. In the book of Ephesians we also have the woman. As we all know, Ephesians is a book on the church, which is the greater part of the woman in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107680" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span>. In Ephesians this woman is the wife of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="udGqnkRQe0Fa75Rq062nBbUbGM-Cru5uLLQkayoHbSEK216rHpUxhj5eVqRJadTMc">STRENGTHENED TO BECOME<br/>THE STRONGER PART WITHIN THE WOMAN</h2><p data-content-id="fGUGkn5to2I5UFoKv1VNdQtvjdhTqWpfFL58bNBasS6Otne5-f2c6FWgAyNaUaldn"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107681" data-verses="Ephesians 3:16">Ephesians 3:16</span> Paul prayed that the Father would grant us, “according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.” This strengthening takes place in our inner man, which is our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit. The more we are strengthened in our inner man, the more we become the stronger part within the woman. The key to becoming the stronger part within the woman is being strengthened in our inner man. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107682" data-verses="Ephesians 3:18">verse 18</span> Paul continues to pray that we would “be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth.” Although the King James Version uses the word <em>able,</em> the Greek word translated <em>able</em> means to be strengthened with power. We must be empowered to know the dimensions of the riches of our Christ. In order to be the man-child, we must be not only strengthened in our inner man but also nourished with all <span class="pg" data-page-id="520" id="520">[520]</span> the riches of Christ. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107683" data-verses="Ephesians 6:10">Ephesians 6:10</span> tells us to “be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength.” According to this chapter, the way to be strong is to put on the whole armor of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107684" data-verses="Ephesians 6:11">vv. 11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107685" data-verses="Ephesians 6:13">13</span>), which is the all-inclusive Christ. To put on the whole armor of God is to put the all-inclusive Christ upon us. Every aspect of the all-inclusive Christ must become our covering. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107686" data-verses="Ephesians 3:16">Ephesians 3:16</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107687" data-verses="Ephesians 3:18">18</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107688" data-verses="Ephesians 6:10">6:10</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107689" data-verses="Ephesians 6:11">11</span>, we see that the way to become the stronger part within the woman is to be strengthened in our inner man, to be empowered to experience the riches of Christ, and to be strong through putting on the all-inclusive Christ as our armor. Hence, in the book of Ephesians we find the aspects of both the woman and the man-child. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ITBVDgsapCA5h0Ba51FA5D5vg5au5jamvrF7YxN5-1GluETQyeBTiS_tmIqIxEe99">FIGHTING THE ENEMY BY PRAYING</h2><p data-content-id="Huy9VfbmqOU-Xs8Ud1qttbqEapY2q5i36RmXphwWDhi5Es85PdREqM_9KTAokR4Qe"> In the book of Ephesians we also have the warfare against spiritual darkness, against the principalities and powers in the heavenlies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107690" data-verses="Ephesians 6:12">Eph. 6:12</span>). These evil powers are, of course, the powers of the enemy, Satan. Therefore, in this book we see not only the woman and the man-child but also the third party, Satan, the serpent. Ephesians reveals that a warfare is raging between the stronger part within the woman and the enemy and, furthermore, that this fighting is carried on by praying. The way the man-child fights against the enemy is by prayer. Eventually, the entire book of Ephesians brings us to one climactic point—watching and praying. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Xi707fcPG3tgdRrB8u8nSWR77mOqcB6y3SAVJIWn_neLMO9oHqhEzON_RcU2wxzw1">TAKING THE WORD BY MEANS OF ALL PRAYER</h2><p data-content-id="UbDmKnrbR6wkXMKUDOIMD2P-kDGyL-FZE9lFaopaqfOk7Tikcu1gMU62N3Lsd0fR0"> At this point we need to present a literal translation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107691" data-verses="Ephesians 6:17-18">Ephesians 6:17 and 18</span>. “And receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit, and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.” According to these verses, the way to fight is to take the word of God by means of all prayer. We should not simply have one way of prayer but <span class="pg" data-page-id="521" id="521">[521]</span> every means of prayer, exercising our spirit to pray in various ways to take the word of God. This portion of the Bible speaks about pray-reading, about taking the word of God by means of all prayer. It is of no avail to fight against the enemy with our own thoughts and words. We cannot use our mind or utterance to do battle against him. The most effective way to war against the enemy is to pray-read the Word, and the best portion of the Word to pray-read is the book of Ephesians. If you pray-read this book in a concentrated way for a period of time, you will be strengthened. Instead of trying to understand the book of Ephesians, you should pray-read it, even covering the whole book in two weeks. If you do this, you will be able to testify that you are becoming the stronger part within the woman. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107693" data-verses="John 6:57">John 6:57</span> the Lord said, “He who eats Me shall also live because of Me,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107694" data-verses="John 6:63">6:63</span> He said, “The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.” The word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107695" data-verses="John 6:1">John 6</span> is for nourishing, whereas the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107696" data-verses="Ephesians 6:1">Ephesians 6</span> is mainly for killing. The word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107697" data-verses="John 6:1">John 6</span> is bread, but the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107698" data-verses="Ephesians 6:1">Ephesians 6</span> is a sword. A sword does not nourish; rather, it kills. But this sword does not kill you—it slays the enemy and all the negative things within you. If we would fight against the principalities and powers in the heavenlies, we must firstly kill all the “bugs” within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="i6aa50jw_pYma5-9kQwhXnKKkpgo1xiWJhSG5jnjgpmh3Z1pRGRhjjd60ipXtg60s"> You may wonder what these “bugs” are. Speaking in terms of doctrine, you may say that these “bugs” are your mind, emotion, and will. But to be practical, the “bugs” that most need to be killed are our opinions. We need an intensified enlightenment to see that we are filled with opinions. When you listen to a message, fellowship with the saints, or read the Bible, you cling to many opinions and concepts. Nearly every saint holds on to some opinion or concept. My point here is this: If we would be the stronger part in the woman, fighting against the enemy by praying, we must take the word of God by renouncing every opinion. In other <span class="pg" data-page-id="522" id="522">[522]</span> words, the way to take the word of God by pray-reading is to have our opinions slain. In message eighty-seven of the Life-study of Genesis we pointed out that to keep the word of the Lord means to take in the Lord and to have all our opinions killed. If it were not for the Lord’s mercy, we would all frustrate the word of the Lord by our opinions. How we need to pray-read the killing word, the word that kills our opinions and concepts! </p>
<p data-content-id="1bH1BoKDaRAJxyi_xbCD4VJbXhDC26bryd7u8eD4YJle8aJWRrCBJAh3feyA9YqSH"> In my experience in the church life, many times I have frustrated the Lord by my opinions. The problem with everyone in the Lord’s recovery is this matter of opinions. I am not saying that we should be without feeling, like a wooden log. When you come to the Word, as a living person who is strong in thought, feeling, and judgment, you must ask the Lord to slay your opinions. Not many saints have prayed in this way. But we must say, “Lord, I am about to pray-read Your word. Lord, kill my opinions.” What has frustrated you from being built up with others is not mainly your weakness or even your worldliness—it is your opinions. We all have a heart to love the Lord and a desire to be built up into the church. Often, however, the outcome has not been according to our desire. Some have been in the church life for more than ten years, but they are still not a part of the actual building. Although they are very close to the building, they are detached from it. No matter how close they are to the building, they are not actually built into it. Their opinions have hindered them from being built up with others. Thus, we all must pray, “Lord, I want to be strengthened in my inner man; I want to be empowered to realize the riches of Christ; and I want to be strong by putting on the whole armor of God. But my problem is that I haven’t yet allowed Your word to kill my opinions.” </p>

We all have been deeply impressed with this sign. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107706" data-verses="Revelation 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> we saw two beasts—Antichrist and the false prophet, both of whom collaborate with the dragon, Satan, to oppose God and to hinder the completion of God’s economy. Following this, we have more crucial matters in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107707" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>. Here we not only see the firstfruits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107708" data-verses="Revelation 14:1-5">vv. 1-5</span>), but the things that follow the rapture of the firstfruits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107709" data-verses="Revelation 14:6-13">vv. 6-13</span>): the preaching of the eternal gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107710" data-verses="Revelation 14:6-7">vv. 6-7</span>), the fall of religious Babylon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107711" data-verses="Revelation 14:8">v. 8</span>), the warning against the worship of the beast and his image and against the mark (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107712" data-verses="Revelation 14:9-11">vv. 9-11</span>), and the martyrdom during the great tribulation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107713" data-verses="Revelation 14:12-13">vv. 12-13</span>). In addition, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107714" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> covers the harvest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107715" data-verses="Revelation 14:14-16">vv. 14-16</span>) and the great winepress (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107716" data-verses="Revelation 14:17-20">vv. 17-20</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107717" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Chapter fourteen</span> has four main categories: the rapture of the firstfruits; the things following the rapture of the firstfruits; the harvest, which is the reaping of the majority of the believers; and the great winepress, which is the reaping of the evil people on earth. Thus, this chapter reveals how everyone living on earth at the end time will be dealt with. </p>
<p data-content-id="qFT3je7o6rEOFRguDp8CG0dTip6Y_eLv-CuesvcrtybeUNGaiOI26ePMHk72T6-ua"> Everyone on earth falls into one of two categories: those who are the people of God and those who are not the people of God. The people of God are composed of Christians and Israelites, the God-fearing Jews. Israel is not covered in this chapter, because it was already covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107718" data-verses="Revelation 7:1">chapter seven</span> with the vision of the sealing of the one hundred forty-four thousand chosen Israelites. This chapter unfolds God’s dealing with the Christian portion of His people. Among this part of His people, there are also two main sections: the <span class="pg" data-page-id="528" id="528">[528]</span> firstfruits, those who ripen early, and the harvest, those who ripen later. Between the rapture of the firstfruits and the rapture of the harvest, four main things will occur: the preaching of the eternal gospel; the fall of Babylon the great, that is, religious Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church; the warning against the worship of the beast; and the great martyrdom during the great tribulation. After the harvest, the situation among the Christians will be cleared up. But those who are not God’s people will still be on earth. They are not considered as the wheat in God’s field, but as grapes in the evil field. These grapes will be gathered into the great winepress and trodden by the Lord Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107719" data-verses="Revelation 14:19-20">vv. 19-20</span>). At that time the whole earth will be cleared up. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107720" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> is a very significant chapter, revealing how the situation of everyone on earth will be dealt with. God is wise, righteous, and sovereign. By His wisdom, righteousness, and sovereignty He will deal with everyone on earth in the proper way and at the proper time. Praise Him! </p>
<p data-content-id="yIistfmiI2_aDzgmmvCwMJLHCsoHQoDpV_WNoVoXfyhbv9uKSdjFfOREsc87szYIq"> What is prophesied in the Bible is simply a principle. We do not have the details. If the Lord had given us all the details of the things to come, the Bible would have thousands of pages, and we would not be able to carry it around. We thank the Lord for His wisdom. We have pointed out that all the world powers from Babylon to the coming revived Roman Empire with the ten kingdoms are represented by the huge image Nebuchadnezzar saw in a dream (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107721" data-verses="Daniel 2:31-33">Dan. 2:31-33</span>). The head signifies Babylon; the breast and arms, Medo-Persia; the belly and the thighs, Greece; and the two legs, the Roman Empire. It is a historical fact that the Roman Empire was divided into two sections signified by the legs of the image. The period indicated by the ankle is ambiguous. Presently we are living in this ambiguous period. A gap was created by the termination of the Roman Empire in A.D. 476, but during this time that gap is being filled in by the Roman Catholic Church. At the close of this long interval, the Roman Empire will be revived and consummate in the ten kingdoms signified by the ten toes of the image. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107722" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span>, these ten kingdoms will be <span class="pg" data-page-id="529" id="529">[529]</span> smashed by a stone cut without hands (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107723" data-verses="Daniel 2:34-35">vv. 34-35</span>). This stone is Christ, who will come from the heavens to smite the entire image, including everything from Nebuchadnezzar to the last Caesar. In His wisdom God has used the image of the human body to give a clear picture of the various stages of the worldly powers. This is the way and the principle of prophecy in the Bible. In a sense, the prophecy in the Bible is very brief. </p>
<p data-content-id="8xVo-B7NrMY0kPDgZqBD43ILNrL-XvWwuq3Joqe2LOC9AD1rboXiIgCBQAwKW-c3U"> The principle is the same with respect to the rapture of God’s people. There is a difference between the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of the majority of the believers. We have covered this matter of the rapture in messages twenty-nine and thirty. Based upon the principle of these two kinds of rapture, we come now to the firstfruits. </p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107725" data-verses="Revelation 14:14-16">verses 14 through 16</span>, the harvest will be reaped later. This means that they will be raptured to the heavens before the harvest, just as the firstfruits of the good land was reaped and brought into the temple of God before the harvest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107726" data-verses="Leviticus 23:10-11">Lev. 23:10-11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107727" data-verses="Exodus 23:19">Exo. 23:19</span>).

Some said that the number one hundred and forty-four thousand was not a literal number, and others said that just as the seven cities in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107733" data-verses="Revelation 2:1">chapters two and three</span> are literal, so must the number one hundred forty-four thousand be taken literally. This number should no doubt be an actual number, but with a symbolic meaning. Although the number is literal, it has a spiritual significance. By applying a certain principle we can apprehend the spiritual significance of this number. </p>
<p data-content-id="7_7f53lSdKfhS9KELOla9LykZ_e_GEkQZ68G2Q-ukinNeICCXYLfJ8k0uws0cEQC4"> One hundred forty-four thousand is one thousand multiplied by twelve times twelve.

<p data-content-id="lNulM8LrKW8XhGNjyhb8z8_REAhcpWRrAM_UAfWfx_DwAjiko112RRWMunPS7zWYR"> The first thing to follow the rapture of the firstfruits will be the preaching of the eternal gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107780" data-verses="Revelation 14:6-7">vv. 6-7</span>). Although you may have read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107781" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14</span> many times, perhaps you have never been impressed with the term <em>eternal gospel</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107782" data-verses="Revelation 14:6">verse 6</span>. Probably no preacher, minister, or pastor has ever told you that in the future, after the rapture of the firstfruits, there will be a gospel revealed as the “eternal gospel.” Most Christians know only the gospel of grace; they do not know that, in God’s economy, an eternal gospel will be proclaimed during the great tribulation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107783" data-verses="Matthew 24:21">Matt. 24:21</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="OPc0C_l9lbNcoMQBRuTefKizOo5FRn5NF3gAaE0-NZcyLxO2KT0pWsR4uiaTts0_i"> The eternal gospel differs from the gospel of grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107784" data-verses="Acts 20:24">Acts 20:24</span>) preached in the church age. The basic content of the gospel of grace is repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107785" data-verses="Acts 20:21">Acts 20:21</span>) that men may be forgiven of their sins and be born again as children of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107786" data-verses="Luke 24:47">Luke 24:47</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107787" data-verses="John 1:12">John 1:12</span>); while that of the eternal gospel is that men should fear God and worship God that they may not be deceived to follow Antichrist, but be brought back to the genuine worship of God, “who has made the heaven and the earth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107788" data-verses="Revelation 14:7">v. 7</span>). Only man is privileged to preach the gospel of grace on earth today (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107789" data-verses="Acts 10:3-6">Acts 10:3-6</span>). But the eternal gospel will not be preached by men on earth, but by an angel in mid-heaven at the close of this age. <span class="pg" data-page-id="542" id="542">[542]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="4GbJibLcKEjqL__jjhGizlp72dNorss18dd9DdMU_NFm4J0W2ehtPh_Rk31LQn9uY"> All students and teachers of the Bible agree that God has various ways of dealing with people. These ways are called dispensations. Although the word <em>dispensation</em> includes the concept of time, it specifically denotes the various ways God uses to deal with people. For example, the dispensation of the law was that period during which God dealt with people by the law. God dealt with Israel through the dispensation of law. In every period of time God has had a particular way of dealing with certain people. After the dispensation of law came the dispensation of grace, the age in which we are now living. In this age God deals with the believers in Him according to grace, not according to law. Just as the dispensation of law was ended by the coming of John the Baptist, the dispensation of grace will be ended by the beginning of the great tribulation. John the Baptist introduced a new dispensation, the dispensation of grace. At the beginning of the great tribulation, when Satan is cast down to earth and the spirit of Caesar Nero emerges from the abyss, the dispensation of grace will be ended. During the three and a half years, the forty-two months, of the great tribulation, God will have another way to deal with people—the way of the eternal gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="nvHEdQi38H-SlLL6P9OfVCFAqmh21xnv2jZt6ZG6aLbP35LOw849ym4uqoStVA0ft"> If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107790" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14</span> carefully, you will see that the content of the eternal gospel is absolutely different from the gospel we preach today. The gospel we preach contains two main items—repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. At the beginning of the dispensation of grace, John the Baptist appeared to preach repentance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107791" data-verses="Matthew 3:1-2">Matt. 3:1-2</span>). Following him, the Lord Jesus preached repentance and faith. John the Baptist said, “Repent” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107792" data-verses="Matthew 3:2">Matt. 3:2</span>), and Jesus said, “Repent and believe” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107793" data-verses="Mark 1:15">Mark 1:15</span>). In Acts, the apostles followed the Lord Jesus to preach repentance and faith. Repentance means a change of mind; it is a change of concept and a change of the understanding of life. Men must have a turn because their life is far from God. Now they must turn toward God. This is what it means to repent. However, this is just a small portion of the gospel of grace. The greater portion of the gospel of grace is believing in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="543" id="543">[543]</span> Lord Jesus Christ that we may be forgiven of our sins and have eternal life to become the sons of God. This is the content of the gospel of grace that we preach today. </p>
<p data-content-id="6gUudY5_FgkP0IWCRfIYS9bktigOsQJMuZnMLKGfCY9m8DxWQTymsdYcJHe9YM_1B"> The content of the eternal gospel is much different. In the eternal gospel there is no repentance nor faith. Rather, there is the commandment to fear God and to give Him glory and to worship Him “who has made the heaven and the earth and the sea and the springs of waters” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107794" data-verses="Revelation 14:7">v. 7</span>). The command to worship God as the Creator is in contrast to the worship of Antichrist and his image mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107795" data-verses="Revelation 14:9">verse 9</span>. The command to fear God and to give Him glory is given to the earth’s dwellers countering the deceit of the false prophet that men should follow Antichrist and countering the threat of death for any who would not worship him during the great tribulation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107796" data-verses="Revelation 13:14-15">13:14-15</span>). The angel who preaches the eternal gospel will seem to be saying, “You must fear God. Because Antichrist is not God, there is no need to fear him. Antichrist cannot put you into the lake of fire; only God can. Although Antichrist may do certain signs, he did not create the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters. God is the Creator. You must fear Him and give glory to Him as the Creator of the universe. Do not worship Antichrist and his image. You all must worship God.” This is the eternal gospel. Because we have a better gospel, there is no need for us to hear this gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="RcLtLXvO2x49e5HSqeDCRKXO2VsfwkQDyI7Yq7O3GLi69XubFEtTV_iN6b9MI_Z-a"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107797" data-verses="Revelation 14:7">Verse 7</span> also says, “The hour of His judgment has come.” The judgment here is the judgment which Christ will execute over all the nations at His coming back to earth, as He predicted in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107798" data-verses="Matthew 25:31-46">Matthew 25:31-46</span>. This judgment, which will be executed upon the living before the millennium, differs from the judgment of the dead after the millennium, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107799" data-verses="Revelation 20:11-15">20:11-15</span>. All the people of the nations who still remain at the Lord’s coming back will be judged according to the eternal gospel preached by the angel during the great tribulation. If, by fearing God and worshipping Him, they have treated God’s people well, that is, they have taken care of the Christians and Jews, the Lord’s brothers suffering poverty and imprisonment under Antichrist’s persecution <span class="pg" data-page-id="544" id="544">[544]</span> during the great tribulation, they will be justified by the Lord so that they may enter into the earthly part of the millennium to partake of the kingdom prepared by God for them from the foundation of the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107800" data-verses="Matthew 25:34">Matt. 25:34</span>). If they have ill-treated the Christians and Jews by following Antichrist and by worshipping his image, they will be condemned and cast into the eternal fire of the lake of fire prepared for the devil and his angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107801" data-verses="Matthew 25:41">Matt. 25:41</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="sgITvoUbLp9kr7so-lifik0UDiCc_l2aWiA8xIiSnO6y-U0RpWzmI90zjb8ycRLz9"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107802" data-verses="Matthew 25:31">Matthew 25:31</span> the Lord Jesus said that He would come in His glory and “sit on His throne of glory.” This verse does not speak of the judgment seat (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107803" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:10">2 Cor. 5:10</span>), but the throne of His glory, because by that time the judgment of the believers at the judgment seat will be over. Firstly, the Lord will descend from heaven to the air. After all the saints have been raptured, He will judge them at His judgment seat. This will not be the judgment of the unbelievers; it will be the judgment of the believers to determine who will be rewarded and who will be disciplined. After this judgment has been carried out, the Lord will come in glory with His army of overcoming believers to defeat Antichrist and his army. After Antichrist and the false prophet have been cast alive into the lake of fire, and after the armies of Antichrist have been made a feast for the birds (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107804" data-verses="Revelation 19:11-21">19:11-21</span>), there will still be many unbelievers, the nations, on earth. Then the Lord Jesus will set up the throne of His glory; all the surviving unbelievers, the nations, will be gathered before Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107805" data-verses="Matthew 25:32">Matt. 25:32</span>); and He will exercise His judgment upon them. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107806" data-verses="Acts 10:42">Acts 10:42</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107807" data-verses="Acts 17:31">17:31</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107808" data-verses="2Timothy 4:1">2 Timothy 4:1</span> reveal that the Lord has been appointed by God to judge both the living and the dead. The Lord will judge the living after the defeat of Antichrist and the false prophet and after He has set up His throne of glory. When this judgment has been carried out, the millennial kingdom will begin. After the millennial kingdom, the Lord will judge the dead at the great white throne (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107809" data-verses="Revelation 20:11-15">20:11-15</span>). </p>

The harvest will be the reaping of God’s people, and the winepress will be the reaping of the evil-doers. There are three peoples on the earth today—the Jews, the believers, and the unbelievers. The Jews and the believers are God’s people, but the unbelievers mainly are evildoers. The sealing of the Jewish remnant was covered in the vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107850" data-verses="Revelation 7:1-8">7:1-8</span>. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107851" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> there is no mention of the Jews, but only of the believers and the unbelievers. The firstfruits, those who ripen earlier, will be taken to Mount Zion in the heavens before the great tribulation. However, the majority of God’s crop, that is, the majority of the believers, will still be on earth after the rapture of the firstfruits and will eventually become the harvest. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="EquHWEovemLQ65DjOF9kgzpp-uiOAkesiQtpIkUhAc0HmLnNxgDapPV_nZlY4Z7aR">I. THE HARVEST</h2><p data-content-id="D08BEZDWCoGzl9aRgkuTZIQByHTkztTSwTEtOAeTiI-pN0qDlIp5_x909EdoSb6yb"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107852" data-verses="Revelation 14:15-16">Verses 15 and 16</span> say, “And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, Send forth Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe. And He who sat on the cloud thrust His sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.” The harvest of the earth is God’s people on earth, the believers in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107853" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">1 Cor. 3:9</span>). At His first coming to the earth, the Lord sowed Himself into His believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107854" data-verses="Matthew 13:3-8">Matt. 13:3-8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107855" data-verses="Matthew 13:24">24</span>). All the believers since that time who have received Him as the seed of life have become the crop of God on earth. Those who ripen first will be reaped as the firstfruits to God before the great tribulation, as indicated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107856" data-verses="Revelation 14:1-5">verses 1 through 5</span>. The majority will ripen with the help of <span class="pg" data-page-id="552" id="552">[552]</span> the sufferings in the great tribulation and will be reaped near the end of the tribulation. Hence, the reaping mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107857" data-verses="Revelation 14:16">verse 16</span> will be the rapture of the majority of the believers who will be left on the earth to pass through most of the great tribulation, because this reaping will transpire after Antichrist forces people to worship him and his image (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107858" data-verses="Revelation 14:9">v. 9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="S7HLy_RJGMBEkAmzzlkouqJfk8wlztxRvkQKX5yY3Yp0fuXWbDKB9XsII8Y1-HQSk"> The reaping of the crop depends upon its ripeness. Those who ripen earlier will be the firstfruits, and the majority who ripen later will be the harvest. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107859" data-verses="Matthew 13:39">Matthew 13:39</span> the Lord Jesus indicated that the crop will be harvested at the completion of this age (Gk.). We have not yet reached the completion of the age; this age is still continuing. At the completion of the age, the field of God will be reaped. Before the time of this reaping, the firstfruits will be ripened and raptured. </p>
<p data-content-id="gmeJHU6Nz9bHbq5NUV6eCQpdICkbEbgabNE5d2gHsrIOUvw44xUHcApdW5D5Qezd4"> According to the type in the Old Testament, the firstfruits were reaped and brought into the temple of God for God’s enjoyment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107860" data-verses="Exodus 23:19">Exo. 23:19</span>). But when the harvest, the majority of the crop, was reaped, it was taken into the barn, between the field and the farmhouse. By this we see that the firstfruits will be taken to God’s house—to Mount Zion in the heavens—and that the harvest will be taken to the air. Not long after the firstfruits are taken to the Lord Jesus in the third heaven, He will leave the heavens and descend to the air, where He will remain for a period of time. According to the prophecy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107861" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">1 Thessalonians 4</span>, the harvest will be raptured to the air. Most Christians merely understand the rapture in a general way according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107862" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">1 Thessalonians 4</span>. They do not see anything regarding the rapture of the man-child and of the firstfruits. </p>
<p data-content-id="eMGG8SZW5aKYwACjfS3uY0Bv4Or8WpvpNMYqz5sYFrO7IjSJfZqHiVhS_6SOouZ-_"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107863" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14</span> covers two kinds of raptures, the rapture of the firstfruits and the rapture of the harvest. The picture in typology portrays this very vividly. In ancient times the early wheat, the firstfruit, was reaped first, and the harvest was reaped later. As everybody knows, a picture is better than a thousand words. In this picture there is no ambiguity and no ground for argument. We simply must take the pure <span class="pg" data-page-id="553" id="553">[553]</span> word according to the picture of the firstfruits and the harvest. We are awaiting the rapture of the firstfruits. Those who do not share in this will probably be included in the harvest. </p>

After the rapture of the firstfruits, the beast, Antichrist, will compel people to worship him and his image. He will also persecute the believers. This will be the great tribulation. The rapture of the firstfruits will be prior to the great tribulation, whereas the rapture of the harvest will be toward the end of the great tribulation. Hence, all the saints included in the rapture of the harvest must pass through the greater part of the great tribulation. </p>

He came as the Son of Man to sow the seed, and He will come again as the Son of Man to reap what He has sown. </p>
<p data-content-id="OPc0C_l9lbNcoMQBRuTefKizOrJFY0ZNF3gAaE0-NZcyLxO2KT0pWsR4uiaTts0_i"> At His coming back, the Lord Jesus will still be the Son of Man. As the Son of Man He is qualified to execute God’s judgment on everyone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107866" data-verses="John 5:27">John 5:27</span>). At this time He will no longer be wrapped, or concealed, in the cloud, but will be sitting on the cloud. This means that He will no longer be hidden; His coming will be public. Prior to this, His coming was hidden, but now it will be open and visible. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107867" data-verses="Revelation 10:1">10:1</span> Christ was still clothed with the cloud, whereas here He is on the cloud. This corresponds to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="107868" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:17">1 Thessalonians 4:17</span> and indicates that the Lord’s coming back is now made public. </p>

The sharp sickle in His hand indicates that He is the One who reaps God’s field. </p>

The suffering of the great tribulation will be like the parching sun, drying the earthly waters from the believers who will be left on the earth in the great tribulation that they may ripen. Before this time, the harvest will still be green. No farmer would reap a green crop. All the field must ripen. When the field has ripened, the time of the harvest will come. </p>

At the time of His coming, the Lord Jesus will send His angels to take the believers out of the field. </p>

No, that certainly will not be the situation. Antichrist will be the Caesar of the Roman Empire, and the Roman Empire does not encompass the whole earth. It will probably include the greater part of western Europe and possibly a part of North Africa and eastern Asia. Surely Russia will not be under the rule of the Roman Empire; neither will Australasia, China, India, or the United States. </p>

The song of Moses indicates God’s triumphant judgment over the enemy of His people, whereas the song of the Lamb indicates Christ’s redemption experienced by God’s people in the presence of their enemy. Thus, the song of Moses praises God for His judgment negatively, and the song of the Lamb praises Him for Christ’s redemption positively. The late overcomers are positioned to stand on the glassy sea because of God’s judgment over the enemy and because of Christ’s redemption of His people. In their praises to God, the late overcomers will declare to the whole universe that they are above God’s judgment on His enemies and that they have participated in the redemption of Christ. Their experience of these two things will become two kinds of songs. </p>

God’s ways are righteous in His principles and true in His promises. If you know God’s ways, you do not need to wait to see His works. Although His works have not yet come, you know that they will come because you know the governing principles by which God does things. We have pointed out that God’s ways are righteous according to God’s principles. As these martyrs undergo suffering and persecution, they will know that God is righteous and that according to His governing principle of righteousness, He will intervene one day to judge Antichrist and to avenge their blood. Although this judgment has not yet come, the martyrs know God’s principle and praise Him for His ways, for His governing principles in dealing with people. These principles are also true in God’s promises. God promises His people that He will judge the evildoers, vindicate His way, and avenge the blood of His people. Because the overcomers know God’s ways, they are assured that He will do what He has promised. </p>

<p data-content-id="sgITvoUbLp9kr7so-lifik0UCjyc73maWiA8xIiSnO6y-U0RpWzmI90zjb8ycRLz9"> Before we consider the outpouring of the seven bowls, I want to say a further word concerning God on the throne and God in the temple. Most Christians, including many of us in the Lord’s recovery, know God only as the God on the throne. They know little of God as the God in the temple. It is rather easy to know God as the One on the throne because this fits our natural concept. However, in order to know God as the God in the temple, we must have a heavenly vision. </p>
<p data-content-id="w61C8Sf0pRjO1CqIL2kXUnSo9upGwG7XzFDh5Au7smcx1nKys-XlikrZOIVeRdjoV"> In the Bible God is firstly revealed as God on the throne. Throughout the Old Testament, God’s people gradually realized that God is the mighty One on the throne. God’s throne is for His dominion. Eventually, the revelation in the Bible leads us from the throne of God’s government to the temple of God’s expression. In the Old Testament we see God in His temple. In the New Testament we also see God in His house, His temple, the church. Ultimately, in the consummation of the Bible, the book of Revelation, the throne and the temple are combined (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107994" data-verses="Revelation 16:17">16:17</span>). In Revelation we see God on the throne in the New Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107995" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">22:1</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="LT7GHt_97QehEFI0vw7uvsMOsmvI4pLJAK6-4yadHVCpNEmCwmz8MPsIjIZIRoY7N"> Most Christians today know God only as the God on the throne. In their prayers and praises they are conscious of God as the One sitting on His throne. They are assured that even if the world were flooded with water, God would still be on the throne. Although we have often heard prayers directed to God on the throne and although we have hymns concerning God’s being on the throne, it is difficult to find a <span class="pg" data-page-id="576" id="576">[576]</span> hymn saying that God is not only on the throne, but also in the temple. Few Christians have the vision of God as the One in the temple. </p>
<p data-content-id="mQZCaUskgKXnWQwz5-GjAk8SqRdCSEcUewFvjwcuYXvkPdWSc6wkDFGa6M3STyygs"> God is on the throne for His administration, but He is in the temple for His expression. God’s eternal purpose is not to be on the throne—it is to be in the temple. Because the throne of God has been eternally established, existing from eternity to eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="107996" data-verses="Psalms 45:6">Psa. 45:6</span>), there is no need for it to be built. However, God’s temple requires a great deal of building work. God’s desire is not simply to be on the throne. He has been on the throne since eternity past. God desires a temple, an expression. Although every Christian knows that God is the mighty One on the throne, not many Christians realize that God today needs a temple, a church, a building, for His expression. Thus, in this country we have been sounding the trumpet about this matter for more than fourteen years. However, even among us, not many in their praises speak of God’s being in His temple. Rather, they praise God as the One on the throne. Have you ever praised God in the way of recognizing His desire to have the temple? </p>
<p data-content-id="ZwRw-sIjrvKZJVrX9K-LjtjuRhm2ZzATTWw_AihsrUNSru4xxjkdO4VC6khkUMgY3"> To repeat, the whole Bible firstly reveals God as the One on the throne. Gradually it reveals God’s desire to have a temple. The ultimate and consummate temple will be the New Jerusalem. As we have pointed out, the New Jerusalem will not only be God’s temple; it will also be the Holy of Holies. For eternity in the New Jerusalem, God will be in the Lamb on the throne. He will be the God on the throne in His temple, having His dominion with His full expression for eternity. Everything God is doing today is for this. This is the reason we say that we are not merely for individual salvation, but for corporate church building. Again I say that God’s intention is to have this temple. God’s throne is for His temple; that is, His administration is for His expression. Ultimately, in the New Jerusalem the river of water of life will flow from God’s throne to supply the entire city. Therefore, the New Jerusalem will be the consummation of God flowing from the throne. <span class="pg" data-page-id="577" id="577">[577]</span> </p>

This mark will be like a malignant cancer. At that time God may seem to say, “Because you bear the mark of My enemy, the beast, I shall put a mark on you.” I do not believe that this sore will come upon the Americans, but on the citizens of the Roman Empire under Antichrist, who bear the name of Antichrist or the number of his name. </p>

This verse says that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus “for all the inhabited earth to be enrolled.” Certainly “all the inhabited earth” did not include ancient China; neither did it include America, which at the time was inhabited only by Indians. We must understand the Bible with its background and the circumstances in which it was written. According to the background, “all the inhabited earth” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108009" data-verses="Luke 2:1">Luke 2:1</span> refers to the world of the Roman Empire. Do not take this to mean every place on the whole earth. The earth-dwellers who will be punished by the seven bowls are mainly those who reside in the territory of Antichrist. </p>

As the prostitute riding on a scarlet beast, this woman has power and authority. This beast, the same as that described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108064" data-verses="Revelation 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>, has seven heads and ten horns. All Bible students agree that the beast here refers to both the Roman Empire and to Antichrist, the last Caesar of the revived Roman Empire. However, there has been debate concerning the identity of the woman, the prostitute. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Wg7ThGFRgCC6wAt8IVPuOma0O5EvEK0qES7VfaycMTRB5rcUso_47aspsnn4s6CTX">I. THE GREAT PROSTITUTE</h2><p data-content-id="2dKAFOptUaVJ1O8CsbCZpWVpbdXfXH7rD3ZULTjfRG56qNxhXho1DQvZyTnlBjLC6"> Who is this great prostitute sitting on many waters? Before we answer this question, we need to say a word about the woman. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108065" data-verses="Revelation 17:18">verse 18</span>, the woman is the great city, the city of Rome, which was built on seven mountains signified by the seven heads of the beast (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108066" data-verses="Revelation 17:9">v. 9</span>). Although the woman is Rome, the prostitute cannot also be Rome, because <span class="pg" data-page-id="584" id="584">[584]</span> the beast will eventually hate the prostitute, make her desolate, and burn her with fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108067" data-verses="Revelation 17:16">v. 16</span>). Antichrist, the last Caesar of the Roman Empire, will certainly not burn his own capital. Therefore, that which is burned by the beast must not be the city of Rome, but something else. Now we must ask this question: According to the Bible and according to world history, who is the prostitute riding on the Roman Empire? Who is the one so intimately related to the Roman state? The prostitute is so closely related to the city of Rome that the two are almost identical. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108068" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">verse 1</span> the angel called her the prostitute, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108069" data-verses="Revelation 17:18">verse 18</span> he called her a woman. The prostitute is the apostate Roman Catholic Church. History reveals that only one figure, one character, matches the description of the female in this chapter, and that figure is the Roman Catholic Church. A prostitute does not have a husband. This indicates that God has never admitted having any relationship with the apostate Roman Church. </p>
<p data-content-id="udGqnkRQe0Fa75Rq062nBbUbHN-Cnu5uLLQkayoHbSEK216rHpUxhj5eVqRJadTMc"> In message thirteen of this life-study I gave a strong word concerning the Roman Catholic Church based upon this chapter. According to the Scriptures, the great prostitute in this chapter is the Roman Catholic Church. If the female in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108070" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">Revelation 17</span> is not the Roman Catholic Church, then who is she? Surely, according to history, only the Roman Catholic Church fits the description of the woman given here. </p>
<p data-content-id="2dKAFOptUaVJ1O8CsbCZpWVpbdXfeVbrD3ZULTjfRG56qNxhXho1DQvZyTnlBjLC6"> Eighteen years ago I spent some days in Rome for the specific purpose of seeing the Vatican. In order to have a full view of that apostate thing, I took eight tours. The more I saw, the more I was convinced that the Roman Catholic Church is the great prostitute in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108071" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">Revelation 17</span>, about which I had studied years before. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108072" data-verses="Revelation 17:4">Revelation 17:4</span> says, “The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet.” The color red abounds in Catholicism. The cardinals, for example, are clothed in red robes. When many Catholics hear that the Roman Church is the great prostitute, they will be offended and not be able to believe it. Some may say, “How can you say that the Catholic Church is the great prostitute? Don’t <span class="pg" data-page-id="585" id="585">[585]</span> we worship God and believe in Jesus? Don’t we also have the Scriptures?” The answer is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108073" data-verses="Revelation 17:4">verse 4</span> of this chapter. </p>
<p data-content-id="udGqnkRQe0Fa75Rq062nBbUbHN-Cv8JuLLQkayoHbSEK216rHpUxhj5eVqRJadTMc"> Notice that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108074" data-verses="Revelation 17:4">verse 4</span> says that the woman has in her hand “a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication.” In typology gold signifies the divine nature. Although this woman is called the great prostitute, she holds a golden cup signifying the nature of God. This gold, however, is merely the outward appearance of the cup, not its contents. Outwardly, it appears to be divine, but inwardly it is filled with abominations and uncleanness. Although the apostate Roman Catholic Church does have certain holy things, it adds filthy things to them. Consider, for example, the worship of Mary. The Mary in the Roman Catholic Church is actually the goddess Venus. Catholicism has absorbed from paganism the demonic legend of Venus. In his book, <em>The Great Prophecies,</em> G. H. Pember points out that even Buddha, under the name of Saint Josaphat, has entered into Catholicism. In the Catholic calendar there is a saint named Josaphat, whose story is actually that of Buddha. Babylonianism entered into Buddhism, and Buddhism, a further development of Babylonianism, was assimilated into Catholicism. Let us now read in full the relevant paragraph from <em>The Great Prophecies</em> (p. 104) by Pember: </p>
<p class="quotesm" data-content-id="fGUGkn5to2I5UFoKv1VNdQtvichTtEpfFL58bNBasS6Otne5-f2c6FWgAyNaUaldn">In less than a century after the death of Belshazzar, a new...faith was spreading in India, the Buddhist religion, which is but a slightly changed Babylonianism....Indeed...Buddha himself is actually a saint in the Roman Catholic Calendar under the name of Saint Josaphat. For the story of Josaphat and Barlaam, which first appears in the works of John of Damascus, a theologian of the early part of the eighth century, and became extremely popular in the Middle Ages, has now been certainly identified with that of Buddha. </p>
<p data-content-id="ITBVDgsapCA5h0Ba51FA5D5vh4au_xKmvrF7YxN5-1GluETQyeBTiS_tmIqIxEe99"> Thus, the story of Buddha was taken into Catholicism. This is one example of the assimilation of paganism into the Roman Catholic Church. </p>
<p data-content-id="Huy9VfbmqOU-Xs8Ud1qttbqEboY2jqC36RmXphwWDhi5Es85PdREqM_9KTAokR4Qe"> Another example is Christmas. Christmas is a blasphemy to Christ, and no Christian with a pure conscience <span class="pg" data-page-id="586" id="586">[586]</span> should have anything to do with it. As the book, <em>The Two Babylons,</em> proves, Christmas originated from European paganism. Centuries before the Christian era, on December 25 the European pagans celebrated the birthday of the sun. When Constantine embraced Christianity, he encouraged the Roman citizens to become Christians, and he even rewarded many thousands for being baptized. Thousands who knew nothing of Christ were baptized and came into Christendom, bringing their pagan customs with them. Later, the name of Christ was attached to the birth of the sun god celebrated on December 25. In principle, the celebration of Easter is the same. Although some Christians in Orange County condemn us as heretical, they themselves still practice the pagan festival of Christmas. To be sure, during the three and a half years of the great tribulation all Christians will abandon such things as Christmas, Easter, the worship of Mary, and all paganism. </p>
<p data-content-id="Xi707fcPG3tgdRrB8u8nSWR76nOqUSKy3SAVJIWn_neLMO9oHqhEzON_RcU2wxzw1"> In message forty-eight I shared with you my belief that the United States is the nation of the eagle and that in the coming years the local churches will exert a positive influence among Christians. I further believe that the Lord’s recovery will spread to the leading cities throughout the world. Already there are some churches in Europe and at least seventeen churches in Brazil. Moreover, there are churches in Ghana, Nigeria, Australia, New Zealand, and many throughout all the countries in the Far East, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. The Lord’s recovery is spreading. In many leading cities the local church stands as a testimony to both believers and unbelievers. We must sound our trumpet and testify of Christ and the Body. Eventually, all the Christians in the world will be influenced. Presently, some argue with us, fight against us, and oppose us. But the day is coming when every mouth will be shut, for all we have been ministering will be fulfilled. The overcomers will be raptured, and Antichrist will be manifested. Furthermore, the Roman Catholic Church will be utterly burned and destroyed. As Antichrist and the ten <span class="pg" data-page-id="587" id="587">[587]</span> horns are destroying the Vatican, do you think that people in the United States will still attend the Catholic Church? Certainly not! By that time many genuine Christians in Catholicism will turn to the way of the Lord’s recovery. </p>
<p data-content-id="kJtprzMv-iEybgkzNyzDTDV_B4HZ36PsrUhhtuCMESGHnnFsJwP3wtj5eeGMBki0p"> I strongly believe that the Lord is using His recovery to produce the living firstfruit. This is the first function of the Lord’s recovery. After the rapture of the firstfruit, the local churches will be used by the Lord to help all the remaining Christians. This will be the second function of the recovery. During the great tribulation, Christians will have a proper place to which they can go. Christmas, Easter, and all the traditional things of Christianity will be discarded. There will be no more arguments, all the divisive names of the daughters of the great prostitute will be abandoned, and the Lord will absolutely vindicate His way of the church. </p>

According to history, the Roman Empire had twelve Caesars; Antichrist will be the thirteenth. Out of the twelve Caesars, only six are included in the prophecy of Revelation. The first five have fallen; that is, they have died unnaturally (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108102" data-verses="Judges 3:25">Judg. 3:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108103" data-verses="2Samuel 1:10">2 Sam. 1:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108104" data-verses="2Samuel 1:25">25</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108105" data-verses="2Samuel 1:27">27</span>). They were Julius Caesar, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, all of whom either were murdered or committed suicide before John wrote this book. The sixth one, Domitian, who was also murdered, was living when this book was written; therefore, it is said of him that he “is.” “The other,” the seventh, who will be Antichrist, had “not yet come” at that time. “When he comes, he must remain a little while” and then will be slain and resuscitated with the spirit of the fifth, Nero, to be the eighth. </p>

They will be one with Antichrist in opposing God and persecuting His people—the Jews and the believers. These ten kings, likened to the ten toes of the great image seen by Nebuchadnezzar in his dream (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108114" data-verses="Daniel 2:42">Dan. 2:42</span>), will submit themselves and their kingdom to Antichrist (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108115" data-verses="Revelation 17:17">v. 17</span>). </p>

Many wonder whether the ten nations of the European Common Market will be the ten kingdoms referred to here. This view may not be accurate, because these kings will receive their kingdom within one hour. Before that time, no one will know who they are.

Those who are with the Lamb are called, chosen, and faithful. Notice that “chosen” is mentioned after “called.” To be called is to be saved, whereas to be chosen is to be approved by the Lord on the basis of an overcoming life. Many are called today, but few will be chosen in the future (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108121" data-verses="Matthew 22:14">Matt. 22:14</span>). We all have been called. In order to be among the chosen in the future we need to live an overcoming life today. </p>
<p data-content-id="w61C8Sf0pRjO1CqIL2kXUnSo9uJG0V7XzFDh5Au7smcx1nKys-XlikrZOIVeRdjoV"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108122" data-verses="Revelation 17:16-17">Verses 16 and 17</span> say, “And the ten horns which you saw and the beast, these shall hate the prostitute and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh and shall burn her utterly with fire; for God has put it into their hearts to do His mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God shall be accomplished.” That the ten horns and the beast will hate the prostitute and make her desolate means that Antichrist and the ten kings will destroy the apostate Roman Church. This will transpire at the beginning of the great tribulation. They will make the Roman Church desolate and naked, destroying her, robbing her of her riches, and exposing her; they “shall eat her flesh,” killing her members; and they “shall burn her utterly with fire,” annihilating her altogether. This also indicates that Babylon the Great mentioned in this chapter is the religious one. It will be of God that Antichrist and his ten kings destroy the apostate Roman Church. This should not be considered as martyrdom, but as the avenging judgment of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="603" id="603">[603]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="LT7GHt_97QehEFI0vw7uvsMOsmPI96bJAK6-4yadHVCpNEmCwmz8MPsIjIZIRoY7N"> In 1929 Mussolini signed an agreement with Pope Pius XI making Vatican City an independent nation. Today the Vatican exercises power, authority, and influence over many nations, and ambassadors from other nations are sent to the Vatican. Probably this influence of the Vatican will arouse the hatred of the ten kings, and they will propose to the beast that they destroy the Roman Catholic Church. According to the picture in this chapter, the woman is riding upon the beast. Because the rider always controls the carrier, not the carrier the rider, this means that the prostitute controls the beast, not the beast the prostitute. For example, in driving your car, the car does not control you; you control it. Today, the Roman Catholic Church rides over politics. Eventually, this will stir up the ten kings to hate the prostitute, and together with Antichrist they will destroy her. </p>

The Bible reveals three aspects of Babylon: the literal, ancient Babylon, the religious Babylon, and the material Babylon. The site of ancient Babylon is in today’s Iraq. I visited that region eighteen years ago and found it to be dusty and hot, like an oven. I could not stand to stay there. Before I visited that place, I had studied the curses pronounced upon Babylon recorded in the Bible. The Old Testament, especially the book of Jeremiah, contains many curses and condemnations pronounced by God upon Babylon. In my visit I saw that in every respect the word of the Bible concerning Babylon had been proved true. </p>
<p data-content-id="BM6WPQDgbT__QB93oHAQLnlaa_U1oj3XBIVTiOGoM8gwQ4MS1D6UUKO84G9MHWJh_"> The ancient city of Babylon is also the ancient Babel. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108130" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">Genesis 11</span> speaks of the tower and city of Babel. Both <em>Babel,</em> the Hebrew word, and <em>Babylon,</em> the Greek word, mean confusion. Babel was founded by Cush, the father of Nimrod. According to history, Nimrod invented the pagan, idolatrous system of worship. Many centuries later, Babel was enlarged by Nebuchadnezzar and became the Babylon known in the Old Testament. Babylon became an evil and devilish place because under Nebuchadnezzar the Babylonians destroyed God’s temple and seized the holy vessels, the vessels for the service of God in the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108131" data-verses="Daniel 1:1-2">Dan. 1:1-2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108132" data-verses="2Kings 25:8-9">2 Kings 25:8-9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108133" data-verses="2Kings 25:14-15">14-15</span>). Furthermore, Nebuchadnezzar brought these vessels to Babylon and placed them in the temple of his idols (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108134" data-verses="Daniel 1:1-2">Dan. 1:1-2</span>). That was an insult to God. At the time of the recovery in the Old Testament, Ezra brought these vessels back to Jerusalem and placed them in the rebuilt temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108135" data-verses="Ezra 1:7-11">Ezra 1:7-11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108136" data-verses="Ezra 5:14">5:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108137" data-verses="Ezra 6:5">6:5</span>). Therefore, Babylon became evil not only because of her idolatry, but also because she destroyed God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="608" id="608">[608]</span> temple and carried away into captivity God’s people and the holy vessels. </p>
<p data-content-id="xsF1VTQ6uNmvQ0gsEZfYs9IbOQITDSFzV_mWIqnjliKoXml2ZS6zTzBkq4NzheEv5"> In the Bible we have two important lines—the line of Babel and the line of Jerusalem. The line of Babel is a counterfeit of the line of Jerusalem. Before God began the line of Jerusalem, Satan began his counterfeit. Thus, two cities, Babylon and Jerusalem, are opposed to each other. These two lines continue to the present day. The church is today’s Jerusalem, and the Roman Catholic Church is today’s Babel, Babylon. Furthermore, the daughters of the great prostitute, the denominations and groups which still practice some of the Babylonian traditions, also belong in the category of Babylon. Only the pure, genuine local churches are in the line of Jerusalem today. </p>
<p data-content-id="rFrCGjzy0s3seaoP5ZFz1WE5ZAsBA8Jn7QPczLYQpR6KGf-mSZlvxLAT6G-4WlYEl"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108138" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">Chapters seventeen through twenty-two</span> are the ultimate conclusion of the whole Bible. In these chapters we also see two cities—Babylon and Jerusalem. Babylon will be utterly destroyed, and Jerusalem will be completely built up. This is the consummation of the Bible, the ultimate issue of the line of Babel and the line of Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="dqTRyG6GA884EmjvR4UyOegfIIRGdZtc9pTPOwHALeZwBCUtG7wCY77G5UKUOOnaQ"> The writings of G. H. Pember and Alexander Hislop’s <em>The Two Babylons</em> say that, without exception, every pagan religion originated with Babylonianism. The religion invented by Nimrod has spread throughout the world, even to India, China, and Japan. Nimrod, for example, originated the picture of the Madonna and her child. The story behind this picture is an evil story of incest. Nevertheless, that picture has been taken into Catholicism and presented as a picture of Mary and Jesus. As a child, I saw this picture of the woman and her infant in the idol temples in China. Later I was surprised to see the same picture in a Catholic cathedral. Eventually, through study I learned that they were both of the same origin. The first Catholic missionaries to go to China found the image of the Madonna and child already in the Buddhist temples. It was also found in Japan and India. Although the same picture under different titles is found everywhere, its origin can be traced to Nimrod at Babel. This example illustrates that every religion is an <span class="pg" data-page-id="609" id="609">[609]</span> outgrowth of Babylonianism. All religion comes from one devilish source—the ancient city of Babylon. </p>
<p data-content-id="QpDUAnrDI_WRFtrr3f3Kzh9t5aPEMCS3lhyUHZa2seNBxZHOZbMQUNSElYwe-H2bi"> The second aspect of Babylon is religious Babylon. In the eyes of God the Roman Catholic Church, which perpetuates much of Judaism and has assimilated much from paganism, is Babylon. </p>
<p data-content-id="zZdlZsx_Xy-tGxScyNm6rM6fBkEfIjoMErtkQIYPSIs0hDew6MtdTE2PZ2QGnjo-X"> The third aspect of Babylon is the material Babylon, the city of Rome. </p>
<p data-content-id="aW2aGRh_13sA-UYZ1egivQxgrBGN10qxrWvBvRqb8eU43xPKWs7vx4JzgzkzVkyZK"> At times it is difficult to distinguish these three aspects of Babylon because the Bible blends them together. For example, the Babylon in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108139" data-verses="Revelation 18:1">Revelation 18</span> is material Babylon. But when I was young, I was told by some Christian teachers that it is the literal Babylon. This chapter, however, does not refer to the literal Babylon; it refers to the city of Rome, which is Babylon in the eyes of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="by2v23Nedf13WGfghX9I29VrpxV_sSRCOuCyECvjxyFHKSsKwXMqeaZkYrTMh3eTi"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108140" data-verses="Revelation 17:1-2">Revelation 17 and 18</span> two aspects of Babylon, the religious aspect and the material aspect, are mixed together. On the one hand, the female in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108141" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> is a “prostitute” signifying the apostate church; on the other hand, she is a “woman” signifying the city of Rome. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108142" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">Verse 1</span> speaks of the prostitute, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108143" data-verses="Revelation 17:18">verse 18</span> speaks of the woman. Therefore, the female in this chapter has the aspect of the prostitute, the apostate church, and the aspect of the woman, the physical city of Rome. </p>
<p data-content-id="qFT3je7o6rEOFRguDp8CG0dTjoqY7Mbv-CuesvcrtybeUNGaiOI26ePMHk72T6-ua"> It is not easy to understand the Bible. We need to pray over and ponder certain portions again and again. I do not know why the Lord in some verses mixes together the various aspects of Babylon. I only know that He has done so. Knowing the various aspects of Babylon is like knowing the prophecies regarding the two comings of Christ. In a number of places in the Old Testament Christ’s two comings are mentioned together. It is like two mountain ranges that appear to be one when they are viewed from a distance. But as you approach them, you realize that there is a great gap between them. In reading the prophecies regarding the coming of Christ, we must know which refer to His first coming and which refer to His second coming. It is the same with the verses regarding Babylon. We must discern which <span class="pg" data-page-id="610" id="610">[610]</span> refer to ancient Babylon, which to religious Babylon, and which to material Babylon. If we are clear about this, then we shall be able to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108144" data-verses="Revelation 17:1-2">Revelation 17 and 18</span>. Years ago, I simply could not understand these chapters because I did not know the various aspects of Babylon. If we are clear about these aspects, then we have a solid foundation for understanding these two chapters, and we shall be able to discern which verses concern the religious aspect and which verses concern the material aspect. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yIistfmiI2_aDzgmmvCwMJLHDt4HX7jpV_WNoVoXfyhbv9uKSdjFfOREsc87szYIq">I. THE APPEARING OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="8xVo-B7NrMY0kPDgZqBD43ILMqb-R8mwuq3Joqe2LOC9AD1rboXiIgCBQAwKW-c3U"> Christ will appear at the time of the destruction of material Babylon. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108145" data-verses="Revelation 18:1">Revelation 18:1</span> says, “After these things I saw another Angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was illumined with His glory.” This Angel is Christ, coming down out of heaven, with whose glory the earth is illumined. In His appearing Christ will come as an angel sent by God. In the Old Testament several times Christ was the angel sent by God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108146" data-verses="Genesis 22:11-12">Genesis 22:11-12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108147" data-verses="Exodus 3:2-6">Exodus 3:2-6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108148" data-verses="Judges 6:11-24">Judges 6:11-24</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108149" data-verses="Zechariah 1:11-12">Zechariah 1:11-12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108150" data-verses="Zechariah 2:3">2:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108151" data-verses="Zechariah 2:8-11">8-11</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108152" data-verses="Zechariah 3:1-7">3:1-7</span>, we read of the angel of the Lord. As we study the context of all these references to the angel of the Lord, we see that the angel of the Lord is actually the Lord Himself. In the book of Revelation Christ is revealed at least three or four times as an angel sent by God to fulfill God’s commission (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108153" data-verses="Revelation 7:2">7:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108154" data-verses="Revelation 8:3">8:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108155" data-verses="Revelation 10:1">10:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108156" data-verses="Revelation 18:1">18:1</span>). Here Christ appears in this way. </p>
<p data-content-id="06HaLz-rodl0AfizE_p5q65Gowu-hz05Vzf9t1pdh1RDT-1G6VyoGGe03xNQWK59K"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108157" data-verses="Revelation 10:1">10:1</span> Christ was still clothed with a cloud, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108158" data-verses="Revelation 14:14">14:14</span> He was sitting on the cloud, whereas His glory here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108159" data-verses="Revelation 18:1">18:1</span> shines over the earth, indicating that His coming back to earth is closer than the coming mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108160" data-verses="Revelation 10:1">10:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108161" data-verses="Revelation 14:14">14:14</span>. He will come down out of heaven firstly in the cloud secretly, then He will come on the cloud openly, and eventually He will shine over the earth to destroy Babylon the Great, the city of Rome, with great authority. At this time He will take full possession of the earth, and the earth will become His kingdom. Therefore, the fall of material Babylon will transpire at the appearing of Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="611" id="611">[611]</span> </p>

Perhaps you have never realized that, as the Lamb, Christ needs a wedding. This concept is altogether unreligious. Who would ever think that the Redeemer needs a wedding? One day John the Baptist declared, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108196" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>). This verse clearly reveals that Christ came as the Lamb to take away the sin of the world. Later, John the Baptist also indicated that Christ is the Bridegroom. John said, “He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom’s voice” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108197" data-verses="John 3:29">John 3:29</span>). Hence, in the Gospel of John, Christ is revealed both as the Lamb who came to take away sin and as the Bridegroom who came that He might have the Bride. Christ’s goal is not to remove sin; it is to have the Bride. In the book of Revelation, also written by the apostle John, we see that Christ our Redeemer is the Lamb and the coming Bridegroom. Therefore, as the Bridegroom, He must have a wedding. </p>
<p data-content-id="38DbLjkjfrpGOnLvrDZzvLBG2nkAB03T0zpiuZ_ALgyZ1yVY5W1UVpbk1LrYnnGZ3"> The wedding of the Lamb will be a universal wedding. It will be the marriage of the Redeemer and the redeemed. At the very end of the Bible we see a city, the New Jerusalem. This city is the wife (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108198" data-verses="Revelation 21:2">21:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108199" data-verses="Revelation 21:9-10">9-10</span>), and the redeeming God is the husband. Although this concept of the marriage of God and man is foreign to religion, we emphasize it in the Lord’s recovery in order to show that our position is that of the Bride, and that the position of the coming Christ is that of <span class="pg" data-page-id="620" id="620">[620]</span> the Bridegroom. We are on earth being prepared to become the Bride to meet Him, and He is on the throne in the third heaven prepared to come as the Bridegroom to meet us. Thus, He is coming as the Bridegroom, and we are going as the Bride. The Bride and the Groom will meet, neither in heaven nor on the earth, but in the air. When we meet Him in the air, we shall have a wedding. </p>

AFTER THE DESTRUCTION<br/>OF BABYLON THE GREAT</h2><p data-content-id="cgfMaJYFAO1mOpI22kRdhJ3KfbVLSGwHK7fr4_AyvD4ITdSSCh7v-cnqPDc7CCaPG"> The wedding of the Lamb will transpire after the destruction of Babylon the Great (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108200" data-verses="Revelation 19:1-4">19:1-4</span>). In this universe there is not only a pure, chaste Bride; there is also a counterfeit, the great prostitute. Even part of the Bride has been captured by the prostitute and involved with her. Take the example of Madame Guyon. Although she certainly was part of the Bride, she was involved with the prostitute. The prostitute, however, did not love Madame Guyon; rather, she had her cast into prison. Nonetheless, Madame Guyon clearly was involved with the prostitute. As we have pointed out, she even stood before the statue of Mary. Today’s situation is very complicated. The Bible condemns the prostitute, and we also condemn her. But within the prostitute there are a good number of genuine believers, many of whom seek the Lord more diligently than those in the denominations. Because the situation is complicated, our vision must be clear. We must know where we should be and that we should never be involved with the counterfeit, the prostitute. </p>
<p data-content-id="Yf-rmGLmzs8DVJKAZqsHcn6KjBam-eQpwCL8YYxWWYsYffHyYsR_Jf62ch9moi03S"> The Bible reveals that Satan is always trying to involve himself with the things of God. Satanic activities are always stirred up by God’s move. According to the Bible, there is hardly one aspect of God’s move with which Satan has not tried to interfere. Wherever God goes, Satan goes also. He is even active in the preaching of the gospel and even attempts to inject himself into the work of the building up of the church. On the day of Pentecost both God and Satan were active. The principle is the same in the Lord’s recovery today, for Satan is still devising a counterfeit of what God is doing. <span class="pg" data-page-id="621" id="621">[621]</span> Quite often, Satan’s work will precede God’s work. For example, before Jerusalem was built up by God, Satan erected the tower and city of Babel. Satan knows God’s intention and attempts to produce a counterfeit before God carries out His plan. How subtle! We must clearly perceive Satan’s counterfeit of the Bride and never be entangled with it. We are part of the Bride. How can we become involved with that prostitute? </p>
<p data-content-id="EquHWEovemLQ65DjOF9kgzpp_tiOMkesiQtpIkUhAc0HmLnNxgDapPV_nZlY4Z7aR"> Through the years many dear Christians have come to me, trying their best to argue with me and to subdue me. Some have said, “Brother Lee, don’t you realize that I am a real brother in the Lord? Don’t you know that there are many true believers in all the denominations? Why then do you renounce all of us?” Again and again strong Christians have confronted me with such questions. I have always answered by saying, “You are a dear brother, and I do not renounce you. However, do you know where you are? You are in a place condemned by God. Although you are right as a brother, you are still in the wrong place.” We must see the difference between the person and the place. The person may be absolutely right, but the place where he stands may be altogether wrong. </p>
<p data-content-id="1bH1BoKDaRAJxyi_xbCD4VJbWhTC27bryd7u8eD4YJle8aJWRrCBJAh3feyA9YqSH"> In 1957 a dear servant of the Lord was invited to Taiwan. During his visit, the leading brothers had much fellowship with him. One of the brothers asked him, “Here in Taipei there are several Christian groups claiming to be nondenominational and meeting in the name of the Lord Jesus. Brother, please tell us which of these groups is right.” He replied by saying that none of them was absolutely right and that all of them were relatively right. Shocked by this answer, the brothers immediately asked him by what standard these groups were relatively right. His reply was that they were relatively right according to the measure of Christ. He said that the greater our measure of Christ, the more correct we are in the matter of the church, and the smaller our measure of Christ, the less correct we are in this matter. During the first two meetings with this brother, I did the interpreting. But at this point I entered into the <span class="pg" data-page-id="622" id="622">[622]</span> debate and said, “Now we are talking about the measure of Christ. Some say that the greater our measure of Christ, the more correct we are in the church matter. We would all agree that in the past three hundred years Madame Guyon was probably the one who had the greatest measure of Christ. Nevertheless, can we say that she was right with respect to the church? She was in the satanic Roman Catholic Church. Let us also consider the typology in the Old Testament. The children of Israel were captured and held in captivity seventy years. At the end of those seventy years God intervened to command them to return to Jerusalem. Suppose a preacher rose up and said, ‘There is no need to return to Jerusalem. See how spiritual Daniel is, and he is still in Babylon. As long as we are spiritual, it does not matter where we are.’ Do you agree with this? To be spiritual is one thing, and to be in the right place is another. You may be as spiritual as Daniel, but if you remain in Babylon, you are still in Babylon. Your condition may be spiritual, but you are still in captivity. Don’t use Daniel as an excuse. Although he remained in Babylon, he opened his windows toward Jerusalem and prayed three times a day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108201" data-verses="Daniel 6:10">Dan. 6:10</span>). Daniel died in the very year the command came to the captives to go back to Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108202" data-verses="Daniel 1:21">Dan. 1:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108203" data-verses="Ezra 1:1-3">Ezra 1:1-3</span>). If he had not died in that year, he probably would have returned. As long as you are alive, you must go back to Jerusalem. Do not disregard the matter of position. The Catholic Church and all denominations and divisive groups are condemned by the New Testament. Who can justify them? No matter how spiritual you are, as long as you are in the Catholic Church, in the denominations, or in the divisive groups, you are in a position condemned by the Scriptures.” </p>

After His wedding feast, Christ will come as a fighting General with His Bride, the overcoming believers who are His army, to fight Antichrist, the kings under him, and their armies at Armageddon. Although the third party, the great prostitute, will have been annihilated, the Lord will still have three enemies: Satan, the dragon; Antichrist, the beast out of the sea; and the false prophet, the beast out of the land. These three will continue to oppose Him. Under the instigation of Antichrist, man will even wage war directly against the Lord of lords and the King of kings. Antichrist, the false prophet, and the ten kings and their armies will make war against the Lamb. How terrible! If this were not recorded in the Bible, I would not be able to believe that man could actually declare war on God. </p>

After all these things have been completed, one more thing will still remain—the war at Armageddon. Christ’s enemies will become all the more evil, even declaring war against Him. Therefore, Christ, the Bridegroom, will come with His Bride to fight against them. </p>

BEFORE THE MILLENNIUM</h2><p data-content-id="_noypB0hbJEfWHQeKjQt1I5FOvunLX4z0lpvsRzPJX5yPZ5jO8HOWpyV1bAQCiwoF"> The war at Armageddon will remove all the obstacles to the coming millennial kingdom. Before we can have a feast, we must clean up the feasting room. The entire universe will be the feasting room, and Christ and His Bride will work together to sweep away the dirt, which will be put into the “trash can,” the lake of fire. God’s sweeping in the universe began in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108259" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis chapter one</span>. Firstly, God swept the dirt into the sea (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108260" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">Gen. 1:2</span>); for at that time the sea was the “trash can” in this universe. Eventually, all the dirt will be put in the ultimate “trash can,” the lake of fire. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108261" data-verses="Matthew 25:41">Matthew 25:41</span> the Lord Jesus says, “Go from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels.” Because the “goats” followed the Devil, they will be cast into the lake of fire prepared for him and his angels. God has prepared the lake of fire as a “trash can” to dispose of all the trash in the universe. Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies will be swept into the “dust pan” and then dumped into the lake of fire. After the millennium, Satan himself will join them there. After the judgment at the great white throne, all the dead unbelievers will also be cast into the <span class="pg" data-page-id="635" id="635">[635]</span> lake of fire. From that time onward, there will be no more dust. In the New Jerusalem, there will be no dust; there will be only gold, pearl, and precious stones. The Lord’s fighting in the war at Armageddon will actually be a sweeping of dirt into the universal “trash can.” The Lord may say to Antichrist, “What are you doing here? Have you declared war on Me? This gives Me the perfect opportunity to sweep you away. My Bride will cooperate with me in doing this.” </p>
<p data-content-id="BM6WPQDgbT__QB93oHAQLnlaa-01sxHXBIVTiOGoM8gwQ4MS1D6UUKO84G9MHWJh_"> Praise the Lord that we are not trash—we are a treasure! Instead of being cast into the lake of fire, we shall be gathered into the New Jerusalem. In order for the Lord to enjoy a pleasant honeymoon and the thousand-year kingdom, all the trash must be swept away. I am looking forward to participating in this cleaning work. How pleasant it will be! </p>

The horse of the first seal is also white and signifies the preaching of the gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108263" data-verses="Revelation 6:2">6:2</span>). Thus, both Christ and the gospel ride on a white horse. In the book of Revelation, white indicates being pure, bright, justified, and approved. This is vastly different from what is indicated by the colors of the other three horses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108264" data-verses="Revelation 6:1">chapter six</span>—red, black, and pale green. Even today we are riding on this white horse. Our preaching of the gospel is pure, bright, justified, and absolutely approved by the Lord.

Judgment can only be executed by police power. When Christ comes to judge Antichrist, Antichrist will be utterly rebellious. Thus, there will be the need for Christ to fight to subdue this rebellion and to judge these rebels in righteousness. His judging by fighting is not only according to righteousness; it is also to maintain righteousness. </p>

In the Old Testament there are many verses concerning the millennial kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108314" data-verses="Psalms 2:6">Psa. 2:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108315" data-verses="Psalms 2:8-9">8-9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108316" data-verses="Isaiah 2:2-5">Isa. 2:2-5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108317" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1-10">11:1-10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108318" data-verses="Isaiah 65:20-25">65:20-25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108319" data-verses="Isaiah 30:26">30:26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108320" data-verses="Zechariah 8:20-23">Zech. 8:20-23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108321" data-verses="Psalms 72:1-17">Psa. 72:1-17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108322" data-verses="Isaiah 4:2-6">Isa. 4:2-6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108323" data-verses="Isaiah 9:7">9:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108324" data-verses="Isaiah 12:1-5">12:1-5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108325" data-verses="Isaiah 16:5">16:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108326" data-verses="Isaiah 32:1-2">32:1-2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108327" data-verses="Isaiah 40:9-11">40:9-11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108328" data-verses="Isaiah 61:4-9">61:4-9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108329" data-verses="Zechariah 14:16-21">Zech. 14:16-21</span>).

<p data-content-id="Te69zzil3D0-mAl8PfN896MADQOo5YKxc7b0VET_-Yefo8dz0ktoThHUcteAt6Rr5"> Between the rapture of the overcomers and the beginning of the millennial kingdom, many things will take place. Immediately after the rapture of the man-child, a loud voice in heaven says, “Now is come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108330" data-verses="Revelation 12:10">12:10</span>). Actually, however, the kingdom will not come at that time, for the three and a half years of the great tribulation are yet to come. Nevertheless, in the eyes of those who have been raptured to the heavens, the kingdom has already come. During the last three and a half years of this age, the following things will take place: the rapture of the majority of the saints; the destruction of religious Babylon, that is, the annihilation of Catholicism; the destruction of Judaism; and the fall of material Babylon. Following all this, there will be the war at Armageddon. The whole earth must be cleared up as a preparation for God’s kingdom to come. At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108331" data-verses="Revelation 20:1">chapter twenty</span>, nearly everything has been cleared up. Only one thing remains, and that is Satan, the source of all the problems. Therefore, the first item mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108332" data-verses="Revelation 20:1">chapter twenty</span>, a chapter concerning the millennium, is the binding of Satan. <span class="pg" data-page-id="646" id="646">[646]</span> </p>

THE IMPRISONMENT OF SATAN</h2><p data-content-id="6gUudY5_FgkP0IWCRfIYS9bksiwOqC5MuZnMLKGfCY9m8DxWQTymsdYcJHe9YM_1B"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108333" data-verses="Revelation 20:1-3">20:1-3</span> we see the imprisonment of Satan. Following the defeat of Antichrist is the binding and imprisonment of Satan to clear up the rebellious earth that the kingdom of Christ may come (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108334" data-verses="Revelation 20:4-6">vv. 4-6</span>). Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss, which is in the heart of the earth. Satan will be imprisoned there for a thousand years. After that, “he must be loosed for a little time” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108335" data-verses="Revelation 20:3">v. 3</span>). The Lord Jesus will cast Antichrist and the false prophet directly into the lake of fire because He has no further use for them. However, even after the war at Armageddon, Satan will still be somewhat useful to the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="RcLtLXvO2x49e5HSqeDCRKXO3V8f52QDyI7Yq7O3GLi69XubFEtTV_iN6b9MI_Z-a"> After the war at Armageddon, the Lord will establish His throne of glory in Jerusalem and gather before Him all the nations still on earth. He will then execute His judgment upon them. As we have pointed out, this will be Christ’s judgment of the living carried out according to the eternal gospel preached by an angel in mid-heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108336" data-verses="Revelation 14:6">14:6</span>). The “goats” will go to the fire prepared for the Devil and his angels, and the “sheep” will enter into the millennial kingdom as citizens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108337" data-verses="Matthew 25:34">Matt. 25:34</span>). Although these “sheep” will be restored, they will not be regenerated. They will still have a rebellious nature within them, and thus they will need a further test a thousand years later. Because the Lord will use Satan to test them, He will not cast Satan into the lake of fire at the beginning of the millennium. Rather, Satan will be kept in the abyss for a thousand years. When the thousand years are over, the Lord will release Satan from the abyss and use him to test the citizens who have been on earth during the millennium. In the next message we shall see that Gog and Magog, the Russians, will not pass the test. Under Satan’s instigation, they will once more rebel against God. In this we can see that Satan is still useful in God’s hands to purge mankind. </p>

This restoration will affect not only man, but also the whole creation—the heavens, the earth, the animals, and even the trees. Everything that was cursed through the fall of man will be restored. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108339" data-verses="Isaiah 30:26">Isaiah 30:26</span> says, “Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days.” Today the sun and the moon are not normal because they have been cursed through the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108340" data-verses="Genesis 3:17-18">Genesis 3:17 and 18</span> indicate, the earth has been cursed because of man’s fall. Thus, the earth today is not normal. </p>
<p data-content-id="LT7GHt_97QehEFI0vw7uvsMOsnPI-77JAK6-4yadHVCpNEmCwmz8MPsIjIZIRoY7N"> When the children of Israel were about to enter into the good land, a land flowing with milk and honey, Moses sent twelve spies to search out the land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108341" data-verses="Numbers 13:1-2">Num. 13:1-2</span>). These spies brought back a cluster of grapes so large that it took two men to carry it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108342" data-verses="Numbers 13:23">Num. 13:23</span>). In 1958 I visited that region and I purposely tried to learn what kind of grapes those were. The guide brought me a cluster of tiny grapes. When I asked why they were so small, I was told that there was no fertile soil and very little rain. Throughout the centuries, the wind has blown away all the topsoil. For this reason, hardly anything can grow there. According to the prophecies in Deuteronomy, this land has been cursed because of the sinfulness of the children of Israel. Therefore, the land has become abnormal. Likewise, the entire universe is abnormal. However, when the millennium comes, everything will be restored. </p>
<p data-content-id="mQZCaUskgKXnWQwz5-GjAk8SqQ9CbWcUewFvjwcuYXvkPdWSc6wkDFGa6M3STyygs"> There are many prophecies in Isaiah, in Zechariah, and in the Psalms regarding the millennium. At the time of restoration, not only mankind but also all of creation will be restored to its original condition. The beasts and the cattle will be restored to such an extent that the “wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108343" data-verses="Isaiah 11:6">Isa. 11:6</span>). This will not be miraculous; rather, it will be normal and common. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108344" data-verses="Isaiah 11:8">Isaiah 11:8</span> says, “And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the viper’s den” (Heb.). Even the troublesome mosquitoes will be included in the restoration. <span class="pg" data-page-id="648" id="648">[648]</span> When a mosquito bites me, I am reminded that the mosquitoes need restoration. After they have been restored, they will make musical sounds, but they will not bite. Do not hate creatures such as mosquitoes, flies, and gophers. Instead, you must blame Adam, for his fall brought about the curse on the creation. But when Christ comes again, everything will be restored. The trees will flourish, and the flowers will blossom abundantly. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108345" data-verses="Isaiah 35:1-2">Isaiah 35:1 and 2</span> say, “The desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing.” Furthermore, “in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert. And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108346" data-verses="Isaiah 35:6-7">Isa. 35:6-7</span>). Also, “a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The Way of Holiness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108347" data-verses="Isaiah 35:8">Isa. 35:8</span>). The book of Isaiah is a full description of the millennium. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZwRw-sIjrvKZJVrX9K-LjtjuRgG2RhQTTWw_AihsrUNSru4xxjkdO4VC6khkUMgY3"> According to the prophecies of the Bible, the millennial kingdom is in two sections: the upper, heavenly, section and the lower, earthly, section. The upper section of the millennium is called the kingdom of the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108348" data-verses="Matthew 13:43">Matt. 13:43</span>), and the lower section is called the kingdom of the Son of Man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108349" data-verses="Matthew 13:41">Matt. 13:41</span>). The kingdom of the Messiah, or the Messianic kingdom, is another name for the lower section of the millennium. </p>
<p data-content-id="ADcOpTWyGt901MiqV_ZKRV6F-OTPB_zaZ6KLGZIyWdC9Glu88RqQYZsBIACfYqBFW"> In the millennial kingdom there will be three peoples. The first are the overcoming saints, including the overcoming saints of both the Old Testament and the New Testament. These overcoming saints will be co-kings of Christ. Christ is the highest King, and we shall be His sub-kings. Therefore, the upper section is the royal portion of the millennium. </p>

Both will take place after the thousand years and before the coming of the new heaven and the new earth. Although the condition of everything in the millennial kingdom will be wonderful, within mankind there will still be a rebellious nature. Because God foreknew that even restored mankind would still have this problem, He will keep Satan in the abyss during the millennium so that He may use him to test mankind after the thousand years are over. By means of this test man’s rebellious nature will be exposed and purged. Thus, the first thing to be cleared away after the millennium will be the rebellious human nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="FrpbcRt3yRk0Uxjm1URW7Eg06g2MmO4pTrxPj1VjX3CdPg4WUZDe1ebWLRh8zhLuo"> Following this, there will be the clearing up of the situation of the dead unbelievers, who are awaiting the judgment at the great white throne. The judgment at the white throne will deal with the dead unbelievers, with death and Hades that hold the dead, and with the demons. Therefore, in this portion of the Word we see the final clearance in the universe as a preparation for the coming of the new heaven and the new earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="Cs3ONxeMth5mwllbyYf4lOgkIyF9pIDV8RSd8O8Hqv0o7uTpEdoOJ6dbZT0nyJr-e"> Before the millennium, many things will be dealt with: the great prostitute, Antichrist, the false prophet, and the evil, worldly forces. During the millennium the Lord will deal with the immaturity of His people. If we are immature and imperfect in God’s eternal life, we are a shame to God. The immaturity of God’s people is truly a shame to Him, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="660" id="660">[660]</span> during the millennium God will rid His people of this shame. </p>
<p data-content-id="P8jMkwpkLdBOj0p4O-2xBwjyOXUf21sfuCHBwhorQzQcIaMpTU1ljj4-xfrJokpi-"> Many Christians hold the mistaken concept that the dispensation of the millennium will be absolutely perfect. Some Christian teachers have said that when the millennium comes, everything in God’s economy will have been completed and perfected. We must strongly declare that this concept is inaccurate. The dispensation of the millennial kingdom will still take place in the old heaven and the old earth. God uses each dispensation to deal with people in a specific way. He uses the various dispensations to make His people perfect, complete, and mature, for the purpose of building up the New Jerusalem as His eternal habitation. All the dispensations are for this purpose. The millennium, the thousand years, will be the last dispensation. In this dispensation certain imperfections will still need to be dealt with. For this reason, the new heaven and the new earth will come after the millennium, not before it. Thus, the millennium will be also a dispensation used by God to perfect His immature people. </p>
<p data-content-id="-m2NLiiFqCHFHE8nxPFGHsCUcu1Pc_l0yGcvkTVWCVV_Epm3QfZFd6BUh2KJg6mtY"> If you mature in the present dispensation, you will not need the next dispensation for your maturity. However, if you do not mature in this dispensation, you will have to mature in the next. In the present dispensation God gives us His life, He affords us His grace, and He also prepares the environment and circumstances we need to grow into maturity. He even uses items of the first death, such as weakness, sickness, trouble, and hardship, to help us grow. But if, in spite of the life, the grace, and the environment, we still do not mature in this dispensation, then, in His wisdom, God will use the last dispensation, the dispensation of the kingdom, to make us mature. To the mature and perfected ones, the millennium will be a reward and an enjoyment. But to the immature ones, it will be a loss and a dealing. </p>
<p data-content-id="p1fZ6JpTsfZKO6kKI7TE51_R9Wb9tFaPuaeKh7AA1i31cpyLjD9mnBPgq5VXps5uw"> In the last dispensation God will even use the items related to the second death to discipline and to punish the immature believers. He will do this with the positive intention of forcing them to grow into maturity so that they may <span class="pg" data-page-id="661" id="661">[661]</span> be prepared to enter into the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth. Thank the Lord that in the present dispensation God has already caused many of us to grow into maturity. In this present dispensation He will also deal with Catholicism, Judaism, Antichrist, the false prophet, and the evil, worldly forces. Then the millennium, the kingdom age, will come as a reward to the mature ones. During the millennium, the immature ones among God’s people will be dealt with so that they may mature. </p>
<p data-content-id="OPc0C_l9lbNcoMQBRuTefKizPo5FY1ZNF3gAaE0-NZcyLxO2KT0pWsR4uiaTts0_i"> After the millennium, the rebellious nature of mankind will still be found in the citizens of the millennial kingdom and will need to be exposed and purged. Furthermore, the dead unbelievers, death and Hades, and the demons will all need to be dealt with. All these negative things still need to be cast into the “trash can.” Therefore, during the millennium God will discipline the immature believers to rid them of their shame and to bring them into maturity. After the thousand years, Satan will be released and used by the Lord to test rebellious mankind and to purge out man’s rebellious nature. After this, the dead unbelievers and the demons will be judged at the great white throne, and all these negative things, including death and Hades, will be swept into the universal “trash can,” the lake of fire. At that time, everything negative throughout the whole universe will be in the lake of fire, and the new heaven and the new earth will come with the New Jerusalem. </p>

Here we see that Satan will deceive the nations to rebel against God. It is difficult to believe that after the pleasant, thousand-year period, so many among the nations will rebel against God and go to war against Him. Nevertheless, it will be so. This war will be the last war on earth, the last rebellion of mankind. Although mankind will be restored for one thousand years, his rebellious nature will still remain. It will be exposed by Satan’s last instigation and it will be purged away by the Lord’s final judgment on mankind. </p>

<p data-content-id="Xi707fcPG3tgdRrB8u8nSWR76leqSB6y3SAVJIWn_neLMO9oHqhEzON_RcU2wxzw1"> In eternity past God purposed to have a corporate expression that He might be fully expressed and glorified (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108451" data-verses="Ephesians 3:9-11">Eph. 3:9-11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108452" data-verses="Ephesians 1:9-11">1:9-11</span>). For this, He created the heavens, the earth, and mankind. Since the creation of man, there have been four dispensations: the dispensation of the patriarchs, from Adam to Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108453" data-verses="Romans 5:14">Rom. 5:14</span>); the dispensation of law, from Moses to Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108454" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span>); the dispensation of grace, from Christ’s first coming until “the restitution of all things” at Christ’s second coming (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108455" data-verses="Acts 3:20-21">Acts 3:20-21</span>); and the dispensation of the kingdom, from Christ’s second coming to the end of the millennium (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108456" data-verses="Revelation 11:15">Rev. 11:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108457" data-verses="Revelation 20:4">20:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108458" data-verses="Revelation 20:6">6</span>). God has used <span class="pg" data-page-id="670" id="670">[670]</span> these four dispensations to accomplish His purpose by perfecting and completing His chosen people that they may be His eternal corporate expression. All four dispensations belong to the old heaven and old earth. Although the dispensation of the kingdom will be the dispensation of restoration, it will still transpire in the old heaven and old earth, because God’s perfecting and completing work in His chosen people will not be accomplished until the end of that dispensation. When God finishes this work, by the dispensation of the kingdom, the old heaven and old earth will pass away through fire and be renewed into the new heaven and new earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108459" data-verses="2Peter 3:10-13">2 Pet. 3:10-13</span>), where the New Jerusalem will come for God’s eternal expression. </p>

The Dispensation of the Patriarchs</h2><p data-content-id="J-GpZUZ4kVBIvd5R8J1AINvati0qYRQAjWB7RQPvz7P22_9iz4SIUft-9nE0gzGry"> Let us consider these four dispensations in more detail. Most Bible teachers say that from Adam until the end of the thousand years there will be seven dispensations. I agree with this. However, these seven dispensations are somewhat of a man-made design. According to the Bible, there are not seven dispensations from Adam to the end of the millennium; there are four. The first dispensation is from Adam until Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108460" data-verses="Romans 5:14">Rom. 5:14</span>). This is the biblical way of marking the first dispensation. Some divide the first dispensation into various other dispensations: the dispensation of innocence, the dispensation of conscience, the dispensation of human government, and the dispensation of promise. But all these should be treated as sections of one dispensation, not as four separate dispensations. In each dispensation certain people have been completed by God. In the first dispensation the patriarchs were completed. They are signified by the stars of the crown upon the head of the universal bright woman (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108461" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">12:1</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="-m2NLiiFqCHFHE8nxPFGHsCUctFPVtF0yGcvkTVWCVV_Epm3QfZFd6BUh2KJg6mtY">B. The Dispensation of Law</h2><p data-content-id="p1fZ6JpTsfZKO6kKI7TE51_R9Vr9lXqPuaeKh7AA1i31cpyLjD9mnBPgq5VXps5uw"> The second dispensation, from Moses to Christ, is the dispensation of law. “For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108462" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span>). In <span class="pg" data-page-id="671" id="671">[671]</span> the dispensation of law God produced the Old Testament saints and perfected a number of them, such as Moses, Joshua, Aaron, Samuel, David, and the prophets. These saints are signified by the moon under the feet of the bright woman in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108463" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="vbXPF1aOezXsRbYDI4kOl4ymMK_tO7rWiEJdW-6x4LFeEqntgYHUHzSWjNe82P6MP">C. The Dispensation of Grace</h2><p data-content-id="Wg7ThGFRgCC6wAt8IVPuOma0O7UvCYkqES7VfaycMTRB5rcUso_47aspsnn4s6CTX"> The third dispensation, from Christ’s first coming until the restoration of all things at Christ’s second coming (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108464" data-verses="Acts 3:20-21">Acts 3:20-21</span>), is the dispensation of grace. In this dispensation God produces the New Testament believers and perfects many of them. They are signified by the sun which clothes the woman. Therefore, in the first three dispensations, God perfects the patriarchs, some Old Testament saints, and some New Testament believers. </p>

This dispensation will begin at Christ’s second coming and last until the end of the millennium (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108465" data-verses="Revelation 11:15">11:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108466" data-verses="Revelation 20:4">20:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108467" data-verses="Revelation 20:6">6</span>). During the dispensation of the kingdom, God will perfect the remnant of Israel and the immature believers. God is wise. In the second dispensation, the dispensation of law, He did not complete the perfection of the children of Israel because they did not give Him the opportunity to do this. They refused to allow God to perfect them. Thus, God has postponed the perfecting of the children of Israel until the fourth dispensation, at which time it will be fully accomplished. During the dispensation of the kingdom God will also complete the perfection of the immature Christians. Many Christians will not allow God to perfect them during the dispensation of grace. Therefore, the Lord will be forced to postpone their perfection until the next dispensation. Thus, one function of the dispensation of the kingdom is to complete the perfection of the children of Israel and of the immature Christians. </p>

After these dispensations, the perfection <span class="pg" data-page-id="672" id="672">[672]</span> of God’s people will be wholly accomplished, and God will have a perfect and complete universal woman, the New Jerusalem.

At that time, the old creation will be over. God will use many things to perfect His people: Satan, Antichrist, the false prophet, weakness, hardship, and various other difficulties. After we have been perfected, God will no longer need the negative things of the old creation; therefore, He can say, “Satan, I don’t need you any more. Go to the lake of fire. Sickness, sorrow, and tears, because My people have been perfected, I don’t need you either. I don’t need anything old. I don’t need the old heaven and I don’t need the old earth. All the old and negative things were instruments used by Me to perfect My people. Now that My people have been perfected, all these things may be put into the universal ‘trash can,’ the lake of fire.” </p>

When I was about to throw some of these utensils away, the brothers asked me not to do it, because they still had a use for them. Unhappily, I agreed to keep them. One day, the building was completed, and all those old utensils were thrown into the trash can. In like manner, when God’s people have been thoroughly perfected, He will have no further use for the old heaven and the old earth. Therefore, at that time, the old heaven and old earth will pass away, and the new heaven and new earth will come in. God will say to the old creation, “My people have been perfected. Because they are all matured, you need not remain any longer.” Thus, the old heaven and the old earth will be put away. <span class="pg" data-page-id="673" id="673">[673]</span> </p>

Before John saw the vision of the seven churches, he also was in spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108511" data-verses="Revelation 1:10">1:10</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108512" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Chapter one</span> not only tells us that John was in spirit; it also reveals that he was on the island called Patmos. If this were not important, it would not have been recorded in the Bible. By being on the island of Patmos and by being in spirit, John could see the churches, the seven golden lampstands. Although many read and study the book of Revelation and have even read our messages on the seven lampstands, they do not see anything. The reason is they are neither in the right position nor in the spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="682" id="682">[682]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="D08BEZDWCoGzl9aRgkuTZIQBzHDk0_zSwTEtOAeTiI-pN0qDlIp5_x909EdoSb6yb"> In order to see anything we need the right standing with the correct angle, and we need the ability to see. Immediately before John saw the seven golden lampstands, he heard a loud voice and he turned to see the voice that spoke with him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108513" data-verses="Revelation 1:10">1:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108514" data-verses="Revelation 1:12">12</span>). I hope that as many in the denominations are reading these life-study messages they will hear a voice and turn to see. However, although many have heard the voice, they are not willing to turn. Even if they do turn to see the voice, they may lack the ability to see. Many denominational preachers have cataracts upon their spiritual eyes. They need to have a specialist remove these cataracts that they may see the vision of the church. When we have the proper position with the right angle and the ability to see, we are able to see the vision of the seven golden lampstands. This was John’s situation on the island of Patmos. Because he was in the proper position and because he was in spirit, he saw the seven golden lampstands as soon as he turned to see the voice. </p>
<p data-content-id="S7HLy_RJGMBEkAmzzlkouqJfl8gl1_BRvkQKX5yY3Yp0fuXWbDKB9XsII8Y1-HQSk"> The principle is the same in seeing the New Jerusalem. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108515" data-verses="Revelation 21:10">21:10</span> John tells us that an angel carried him away in spirit. Never despise your spirit; it is capable of seeing New Jerusalem. The phrase “in spirit” is used four times in the book of Revelation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108516" data-verses="Revelation 1:10">1:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108517" data-verses="Revelation 4:2">4:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108518" data-verses="Revelation 17:3">17:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108519" data-verses="Revelation 21:10">21:10</span>). Each time this phrase is used it introduces one of the four main visions which compose this book. These visions are the vision of the church, the vision of the judgment upon the world, the vision of Babylon the Great, and the vision of New Jerusalem. These four visions are in two pairs. The church and the world are the first pair, and Babylon the Great and New Jerusalem are the second. The world is in contrast to the church, and Babylon the Great is in contrast to the New Jerusalem. The entire book of Revelation is constituted with the church, the world, Babylon, and New Jerusalem. Each time John saw one of these visions he was in spirit. In spirit John saw the churches; in spirit he saw the destiny of the world; in spirit he saw the Great Babylon; and in spirit he saw New Jerusalem. I can testify that even now I have before me a clear view of these four things. In the first <span class="pg" data-page-id="683" id="683">[683]</span> chapter I see the seven churches and in the last chapter, the New Jerusalem. Between these chapters I see the world and Babylon the Great. </p>
<p data-content-id="gmeJHU6Nz9bHbq5NUV6eCQpdJC0bNJgabNE5d2gHsrIOUvw44xUHcApdW5D5Qezd4"> If you want to see these visions, you must be in spirit. Do not exercise your mind to think about the situation. Rather, turn to the spirit and stay there. If you exercise your mind instead of remaining in your spirit, these four visions will disappear from view. If we stay in our mind, we may not think that the world situation is that bad. But if we turn to our spirit and remain there, calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, we shall clearly see the seven lampstands and the fact that the whole world is under God’s judgment. The longer we stay in spirit contacting the Lord, the clearer we shall become concerning the world situation. Furthermore, we shall see the prostitute and realize that she is destined for destruction. Although we may not understand all these things or be able to explain them to others, we shall certainly see them for ourselves. We shall also see New Jerusalem, including all the details, such as the twelve gates and the golden street. </p>
<p data-content-id="eMGG8SZW5aKYwACjfS3uY0Bv5O78e7_pNMYqz5sYFrO7IjSJfZqHiVhS_6SOouZ-_"> Our need today is vision, not understanding. What value is there in understanding the city of Anaheim if you have never seen it? According to the book of Revelation, the apostle John saw many things, including New Jerusalem. Thus, his book of Revelation is not a lecture, a sermon, or even a message; it is a description and a declaration of what he saw. John was taken on a universal tour. After his tour, he seemed to say, “Oh, I have seen Satan cast into the lake of fire and I have seen the New Jerusalem!” We all need to get into our spirit and take this kind of sightseeing tour. After you have seen New Jerusalem, you will not be able to deny the fact that you have seen it. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="5gvNTj0qyHK7fxM7muDqwkXAH_21IdIvbfrgDct-kby-g5UvD45-QA3Mzygn6Yx6f">B. To Be on a Great and High Mountain</h2><p data-content-id="Np0A3NXGY9sb0kEPalq_4D5F2DLcx6DsiVnvh4Vd3iry7xMwdQWdiN4zotccxw5rB"> When John saw New Jerusalem, he was both in spirit and also carried away onto a great and high mountain. The great and high mountain is in contrast to the wilderness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108520" data-verses="Revelation 17:3">17:3</span>. To see Babylon, the great prostitute, John was carried <span class="pg" data-page-id="684" id="684">[684]</span> to the wilderness. To see the Bride, the New Jerusalem, he was carried to a great and high mountain. We need to be uplifted to a high mountain that we may see God’s dwelling place for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. In order for John to see the churches, it was sufficient to be on the island of Patmos. But the New Jerusalem is vastly higher than the churches, and in order to see it, John had to be carried to a high mountain. The New Jerusalem is a mountain city, and we must be on a mountain in order to see it. We need to be in the spirit and to get to a high mountain. This is the way to see the vision of the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="tICK0kqpdw83viGh_xTywHd_crBXvXog1o4YjOZhdjbM1vmCFYdIuEXfD_WST4Dgf"> We also need to know what the New Jerusalem is. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of God’s building work throughout the centuries. Beginning with Adam and continuing for nearly sixty centuries, God has been doing a great deal of building. The issue of this work will be the New Jerusalem, God’s eternal habitation. </p>
<p data-content-id="hhHSRpGa6c8nmBYQbhmi3QAUGS4vvonv3LkGuqyF8VwAmEhhWitCawAl83I6gzdpk"> We have seen that the time from Adam until the end of the millennium is divided into four dispensations: the dispensation of the Patriarchs, from Adam to Moses; the dispensation of law, from Moses to Christ; the dispensation of grace, from Christ’s first coming until the restoration of all things at Christ’s second coming; and the dispensation of the kingdom, from Christ’s second coming to the end of the millennium. During these dispensations God has been carrying out His building work, and He will continue it. Most Christians, however, do not care for God’s building; they care only for their human religion. Praise the Lord that we have been rescued from that pitiful situation! Now we are not in a human religion; we are in the building of God. Presently this building is the churches, and eternally it will be the New Jerusalem. We are in the churches and we are on our way to the New Jerusalem. Thank the Lord that we have such a clear view of the New Jerusalem, our ultimate destiny. </p>

<p data-content-id="lNulM8LrKW8XhGNjyhb8z8_RGBRcrWRrAM_UAfWfx_DwAjiko112RRWMunPS7zWYR"> The meaning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108579" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span> has been hidden from Christians for centuries. Many have understood these chapters in a very natural way and have considered them a description of a material city. When we were young, we heard gospel songs about the golden city and the golden street. </p>
<p data-content-id="OPc0C_l9lbNcoMQBRuTefKizMpJFfn5NF3gAaE0-NZcyLxO2KT0pWsR4uiaTts0_i"> The first verse of the book of Revelation says that the revelation of Jesus Christ is made known by signs. If we would understand this book, we must know the meaning of all the signs. For example, the seven golden lampstands in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108580" data-verses="Revelation 1:12">chapter one</span> and the universal bright woman in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108581" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">chapter twelve</span> are signs. Furthermore, in this book Christ is called the Lion and the Lamb, terms which also are signs. In like manner, the entire city of New Jerusalem is a sign. </p>
<p data-content-id="4GbJibLcKEjqL__jjhGizlp70c9olss18dd9DdMU_NFm4J0W2ehtPh_Rk31LQn9uY"> Throughout the centuries, what Christians have spoken about the church has come out of their mistaken concept of what the church is. When some talk about going to church, they refer to a bungalow with a high tower and a bell. In their concept, a certain kind of building is the church. Even some diagrams of the dispensations use the figure of a building with a steeple to represent the church. Although such a thing may be a chapel, it certainly is not the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="oD3lMOXIl6z0Onm43O-zok5YjsXXT7f6DEIcHzOKTKEbP0Se8eYZQKaye2uoCCFov"> The Brethren, who were raised up in the last century, have an improved understanding of the church. To them, the church is not a building; it is the gathering of the called ones. When believers meet together, their gathering is the church. Although this understanding is correct, it is rather shallow. The church is much deeper than this. Suppose a <span class="pg" data-page-id="692" id="692">[692]</span> thousand regenerated Christians meet together; yet they quarrel, fight, criticize one another, and live in the flesh. Is that the church? No, it is neither the church nor a gathering of the saints; in the eyes of God it is a gathering of the flesh. In one meeting of a certain church board, one member of the board even threw a Bible at another. Such a gathering certainly is not a meeting of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="38DbLjkjfrpGOnLvrDZzvLBG1mkAN03T0zpiuZ_ALgyZ1yVY5W1UVpbk1LrYnnGZ3"> In the last book of the Bible the church is signified by a bright, pure, shining golden lampstand. The Lord uses a lampstand to symbolize the church because the church is deep and mysterious and cannot adequately be described in human language. Thus, the Lord was forced to use a sign, a symbol, to represent it. When you see that the church is a golden lampstand, you will know what the church is. However, if you are asked to define the church, you still may not be able to do it. The church is mysterious, divine, and pure, and human words cannot define it adequately. For this reason, nowhere in the New Testament do we find a full definition of the church. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108582" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22-23">Ephesians 1:22 and 23</span> say that the church is Christ’s Body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. But what does the word “fullness” mean, and what does it mean to “fill all in all”? It is difficult to understand the term church, much less the terms “Body,” “fullness,” and “all in all.” Therefore, in the book of Revelation, the ultimate conclusion of the Bible, many signs are used to convey spiritual realities. </p>
<p data-content-id="Huy9VfbmqOU-Xs8Ud1qttbqEYoI2jrC36RmXphwWDhi5Es85PdREqM_9KTAokR4Qe"> When we say that the church is a golden lampstand, we do not mean that the church is actually a stand with seven lamps. It is a mistake to understand the matter this way. It is the same with the description of Christ as the Lamb. Certainly our Lord is not literally a lamb with four legs and a tail. How wrong to understand biblical symbols in this way! The Lamb is a sign indicating something concerning the Lord. Therefore, when the book of Revelation pictures the church as the golden lampstand, it means that the church is divine and pure; the church also has a light that shines in the darkness. This is the significance and the true meaning of the church being a golden lampstand. <span class="pg" data-page-id="693" id="693">[693]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Xi707fcPG3tgdRrB8u8nSWR75neqUTKy3SAVJIWn_neLMO9oHqhEzON_RcU2wxzw1"> The city of New Jerusalem is also a sign, an all-inclusive sign. In order to understand this sign, our mind must be completely renewed and enlightened. We must not understand the New Jerusalem according to our natural concept. Some argue that New Jerusalem is actually a square, material city. If we have this kind of natural concept, we shall not be able to understand the New Jerusalem as a sign. The New Jerusalem is a sign signifying God’s eternal building as His dwelling place. To be sure, God’s eternal building is not a physical place; rather it is something living. Instead of being a material city, it is an entity constituted with His divine life. This is so mysterious, deep, and profound that human language cannot adequately describe it. Therefore, in His wisdom, God uses a picture, a sign, to reveal it to us. With this principle in mind, let us now consider the various details and aspects of the city of New Jerusalem. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="kJtprzMv-iEybgkzNyzDTDV_C4XZ37PsrUhhtuCMESGHnnFsJwP3wtj5eeGMBki0p">VII. A LIVING COMPOSITION OF ALL GOD’S REDEEMED</h2><p data-content-id="J-GpZUZ4kVBIvd5R8J1AINvaug0qQDAAjWB7RQPvz7P22_9iz4SIUft-9nE0gzGry"> The New Jerusalem is a living composition of all God’s redeemed. The fact that it is such a composition means that it is a living building. The thought that God’s people are a living building is not first found in the book of Revelation. In the Old Testament we see that God’s people were considered material to be built together as His dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="zZdlZsx_Xy-tGxScyNm6rM6fCk0fIioMErtkQIYPSIs0hDew6MtdTE2PZ2QGnjo-X"> The Bible covers two main things—God’s creation and God’s building. In the beginning of the Bible we have creation, and at the end we have the building. Between these two ends we have God’s building work. In creation God produced the building materials. As He carries on His building work, He fits all these materials together into one unit, which is His building. </p>
<p data-content-id="aW2aGRh_13sA-UYZ1egivQxgoB2N11qxrWvBvRqb8eU43xPKWs7vx4JzgzkzVkyZK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108583" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we have a garden created, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108584" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span>, a city constructed. A garden is something natural created by God, and a city is something built up by Him. The New Jerusalem is not a natural garden; it is a built-up city. In the garden in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108585" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> there is the tree of life, and near the tree of life there is a river flowing in four directions (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108586" data-verses="Genesis 2:8-10">Gen. 2:8-10</span>). By the flow of this river we have gold, <span class="pg" data-page-id="694" id="694">[694]</span> bdellium, and onyx, a precious stone. Bdellium here is a resin secreted by a tree that hardens to form a pearl-like substance. The first mention of stone in the Bible is not of ordinary, common stone, but of onyx, a type of precious stone. </p>
<p data-content-id="by2v23Nedf13WGfghX9I29Vrqxl_sTRCOuCyECvjxyFHKSsKwXMqeaZkYrTMh3eTi"> What were the three precious materials in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108587" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, gold, bdellium and onyx stone, used for? In order to answer this question we must read through the whole Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="qFT3je7o6rEOFRguDp8CG0dTgoaY7Nbv-CuesvcrtybeUNGaiOI26ePMHk72T6-ua"> In the breastplate of the high priest were set twelve precious stones (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108588" data-verses="Exodus 28:15-21">Exo. 28:15-21</span>), the first of which was sardius and the last, jasper. Included among these twelve stones was an onyx. This indicates that the breastplate of the high priest is related to both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108589" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108590" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span>, for in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108591" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we have onyx and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108592" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span> we have jasper. In the description of the breastplate of the high priest and of the two onyx stones engraved with the names of the children of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108593" data-verses="Exodus 28:9-12">Exo. 28:9-12</span>), we see a miniature of God’s building. The precious stones of both the breastplate and the shoulder plates bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. This signifies that the redeemed Israelites are for God’s building. The twelve precious stones on the breastplate were set in gold. The gold base held all the precious stones. Certainly this is a picture of God’s building. This breastplate was a building that expressed God. </p>

<p data-content-id="5gvNTj0qyHK7fxM7muDqwkXAE921BOovbfrgDct-kby-g5UvD45-QA3Mzygn6Yx6f"> Let us firstly consider the measurements of New Jerusalem. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108621" data-verses="Revelation 21:15">Revelation 21:15</span> says, “And he who spoke with me had a golden reed as a measure, that he might measure the city and its gates and its wall.” The reed is for measuring, and measuring signifies taking possession (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108622" data-verses="Ezekiel 40:5">Ezek. 40:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108623" data-verses="Zechariah 2:1-2">Zech. 2:1-2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108624" data-verses="Revelation 11:1">Rev. 11:1</span>). Notice that the measuring instrument is a reed, not a rod. A rod signifies or implies judgment, discipline, and punishment. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108625" data-verses="Revelation 11:1">11:1</span>, “a reed like a rod” was used to “measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship in it.” Because a rod implies punishment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108626" data-verses="Proverbs 10:13">Prov. 10:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108627" data-verses="Isaiah 10:5">Isa. 10:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108628" data-verses="Isaiah 11:4">11:4</span>), a reed like a rod indicates measuring with punishment. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108629" data-verses="Revelation 21:15">21:15</span>, however, we have the reed, but no mention of the rod. Here there is no implication of judgment, discipline, or chastisement, for in every respect New Jerusalem is complete and perfect. This city has already passed every test. The universal bright woman, whose consummation is New Jerusalem, has passed through many kinds of dealings and has been measured by many rods in each of the four dispensations. Even today the church is being measured by a rod, not by a reed. When the four dispensations are over and the new heaven and new earth have come, there will be no further need for measuring with a rod. <span class="pg" data-page-id="702" id="702">[702]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Np0A3NXGY9sb0kEPalq_4D5F1BLc5pzsiVnvh4Vd3iry7xMwdQWdiN4zotccxw5rB"> The fact that New Jerusalem is measured with a reed means that it is measured for possession. Suppose you intend to purchase some property. Firstly you measure it, and then you take possession of it. Women do the same thing when they purchase material in a fabric store. The amount of material they measure out is the amount of material they purchase and possess. Likewise, the New Jerusalem, which will be measured by a golden reed, will be fully possessed by the Lord in a very positive way. </p>
<p data-content-id="UbDmKnrbR6wkXMKUDOIMD2P-mCGyL-FZE9lFaopaqfOk7Tikcu1gMU62N3Lsd0fR0"> Notice that the reed is a golden reed. Since gold signifies the divine nature of God, “golden” here signifies that the measuring of the city, its gates, and its wall is according to God’s divine nature. Anything that does not match the nature of God does not belong to the New Jerusalem. God cannot possess anything that does not match His nature. The whole city, with its gates and wall, can pass the measuring and testing of the nature of God; hence, it is qualified to be possessed by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="MfMdlEkgq-a1uKaUUALpAADpAcCSknjRfcVofpiZYMm5RgH8fZWaM9MIilSy8MI87"> Even today God measures the churches by the golden standard of His divine measurement. When God measures a church, He is not concerned with our intelligence, activities, or ability to speak. But He is very concerned about how much of His nature has been wrought into us. Is the divine gold the solid substance of the church? Is the church constituted with God’s divine essence? The church must be substantially divine; that is, the divine substance must be wrought into the very being of the church life. Thus, the standard of measurement is not our human nature, but God’s nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="VhFuMszWUIGfHaNO9f-JJEZi6tuXWIv8VFEUjiuPmuf7Nx9BJILWDFG-eqZg1kGdt"> When we are about to express our love for one another, we must determine what kind of love is being expressed, whether it is human or divine. The same is true with respect to humility and goodness. Although we must be humble and good, we must check whether our humility and goodness are human or divine. This principle applies to every aspect of our humanity. We need to be divinely human; that is, we must have the divine nature wrought into us. Please keep in mind that God’s measurement of the church is according to <span class="pg" data-page-id="703" id="703">[703]</span> the divine nature. The golden nature of God is the unique standard. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="i6aa50jw_pYma5-9kQwhXnKKmogo1xiWJhSG5jnjgpmh3Z1pRGRhjjd60ipXtg60s">B. Of the City Proper</h2><p data-content-id="1bH1BoKDaRAJxyi_xbCD4VJbVgDC26bryd7u8eD4YJle8aJWRrCBJAh3feyA9YqSH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108630" data-verses="Revelation 21:16">verse 16</span> we have the measurements of the city proper. “And the city lies foursquare, and its length is the same as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed, at twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.” When I was young, I was troubled by the fact that the height of the wall was a hundred and forty-four cubits and that the height of the city was twelve thousand stadia. The measurements of the city imply that the city proper is like a mountain with the height of twelve thousand stadia, whereas the wall itself from the foundation to the top is a hundred forty-four cubits. Twelve thousand stadia are more than seven million feet, or more than one thousand three hundred sixty miles. </p>
<p data-content-id="9rVdP9OOQSCrvWwNpNEghXtIXePMUansp2Q1i322XjDbKlbCI5SwCkdRWdaVi_g0k"> Another thing that troubled me about the city was that it has just one street. I wondered how this one street could serve all twelve gates. According to my opinion, there should have been at least twelve streets, one for each gate. One day, during my stay with Brother Nee in Shanghai, he pointed out that New Jerusalem is a mountain, and that the one street spirals down the mountain from the throne and passes by all twelve gates. No matter which gate we enter, we find ourselves on the same street. Because the street is a spiral, it is impossible for anyone to get lost in this city. Even if you walk blindly along this street, you will never lose your way. </p>
<p data-content-id="jA4s3Ofm8UagYZF7i1Vjw0XMtKGabzsDNDcRyxqadYigZpP5BmO3xTrtY6N7RJdCR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108631" data-verses="Revelation 21:16">Verse 16</span> says that “the city lies foursquare.” The length is the same as its breadth. The fact that New Jerusalem is square signifies that it is perfect and complete in every way, absolutely straight and not in the least oblique. </p>
<p data-content-id="Te69zzil3D0-mAl8PfN896MAAR-o9Laxc7b0VET_-Yefo8dz0ktoThHUcteAt6Rr5"> The length, breadth, and height of New Jerusalem are equal; it is twelve thousand stadia in each dimension. Twelve thousand is one thousand times twelve. Since twelve signifies absolute perfection and eternal completion in God’s eternal administration, twelve thousand signifies a thousand times this. <span class="pg" data-page-id="704" id="704">[704]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="nvHEdQi38H-SlLL6P9OfVCFAonB21znv2jZt6ZG6aLbP35LOw849ym4uqoStVA0ft"> According to its measurements, New Jerusalem is a cube. The dimensions of the Holy of Holies, both in the tabernacle and in the temple, are equal in length, breadth, and height (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108632" data-verses="Exodus 26:2-8">Exo. 26:2-8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108633" data-verses="1Kings 6:20">1 Kings 6:20</span>). The Holy of Holies in the tabernacle was a cube measuring ten cubits in each dimension, and the Holy of Holies in the temple was a cube twenty cubits in each dimension. That the length, breadth, and height of New Jerusalem are equal signifies that the entire New Jerusalem is the Holy of Holies. Therefore, New Jerusalem is the Holy of Holies enlarged to the uttermost. </p>
<p data-content-id="6gUudY5_FgkP0IWCRfIYS9bkvjAOsSJMuZnMLKGfCY9m8DxWQTymsdYcJHe9YM_1B"> In the Life-study of Hebrews we pointed out that our experience of the Holy of Holies must be constantly increasing (see message fifty-two, pp. 578-579). This means that in our experience the Holy of Holies must be continuously enlarged. Firstly, we have the smaller Holy of Holies in Exodus; then we have the larger Holy of Holies in 1 Kings; and ultimately we have the largest Holy of Holies in the book of Revelation. Eventually, our Holy of Holies will be more than one thousand three hundred sixty miles in length, width, and height. </p>
<p data-content-id="RcLtLXvO2x49e5HSqeDCRKXO0UMfzkwDyI7Yq7O3GLi69XubFEtTV_iN6b9MI_Z-a"> Now we need to see what the principle of the Holy of Holies is. The principle of the Holy of Holies is that man can live and walk directly in the presence of God. According to the Old Testament, only the high priest was allowed to enter into the Holy of Holies. But the book of Hebrews reveals that through the redeeming blood of Christ, the Holy of Holies is open to all those who believe in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108634" data-verses="Hebrews 10:19-22">Heb. 10:19-22</span>). All the redeemed ones may enter into the presence of God, live there, and remain there, enjoying fellowship in oneness with God. The coming New Jerusalem will be such a place. Everyone in it will see God, touch God, worship God, serve God, and even live and dwell in the presence of God. The church life today must be a Holy of Holies. The church must be a cube, and its nature must be utterly holy. </p>

Twelve times twelve signifies absolute perfection and eternal completion of absolute perfections and eternal completions. How perfect and complete is the wall of the holy city in God’s eternal administration! This verse says that the wall is the measure of a man, “that is, of an angel.” It is in resurrection that man will be like the angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108636" data-verses="Matthew 22:30">Matt. 22:30</span>). Hence, “a measure of a man, that is, of an angel” signifies that the wall of the city is not natural, but in resurrection. </p>

Unified in Appearance on All Four Sides</h2><p data-content-id="9rVdP9OOQSCrvWwNpNEghXtIXe_MSJXsp2Q1i322XjDbKlbCI5SwCkdRWdaVi_g0k"> As we have already pointed out, jasper is the appearance of God. The fact that the building material of the entire wall is jasper indicates that New Jerusalem, as the corporate expression of God in eternity, bears the appearance of God. This city is unified in appearance on all four sides. This indicates that all differences have vanished and that the city is the unique expression of the Triune God. This is vastly different from the concept of many Christians, who think that we all should be different and express Christ in different ways. According to this concept, you express Christ in your way, and I express Christ in my way. In the past I was taught that both the individual believers and the churches should be different from one another and that no church should be the same as others. I was not only taught this way, but I also preached it myself. I said that we should not imitate or copy others. Using our faces as an illustration, I said that every face is unique. But by studying the book of Revelation again, I saw that the seven lampstands are exactly the same. If all seven were placed on the table in front of you, you would not be able to tell them apart. Each lampstand would lose its identity. When I saw that, my point of view was radically revolutionized, and I said to myself, “What a mistaken concept I received from those who foolishly said that the seven churches are different! Yes, they are different in the negative aspects. Certainly the church in <span class="pg" data-page-id="710" id="710">[710]</span> Philadelphia did not have the idols found in Thyatira. But on the positive side, they are all the same. They have one God and one Christ.” I had truly been enlightened. </p>
<p data-content-id="jA4s3Ofm8UagYZF7i1Vjw0XMtK2aSgsDNDcRyxqadYigZpP5BmO3xTrtY6N7RJdCR"> From that day onward, the Lord has pointed out this matter to me again and again, eventually showing me the four sides of the wall of New Jerusalem. Each side is the same in appearance. Although perhaps millions of jasper stones have been fit together to form the wall, every side of the wall has the same expression. Each side is the same in material, in substance, in color, and in appearance. Hence, we all must be alike. I must be like you, and you must be like me. Ultimately, we shall be so much like one another that we shall lose our identity. Seeing this enables us to understand Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108642" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:10">1 Corinthians 1:10</span>: “But I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.” We must say the same thing and be attuned to the same opinion. This does not mean that we are controlled by anyone. None of the jasper stones built into the wall of New Jerusalem is controlled. They are the same in substance, in color, in appearance, in brightness, and in glory because they have been transformed by the same life. Thus, we all must imitate one another and copy one another. The sisters must imitate the brothers, and the brothers must copy the sisters. This does not mean to copy the natural characteristics of others. It means to copy the jasper, to copy the substance, the color, and the appearance. </p>
<p data-content-id="Te69zzil3D0-mAl8PfN896MAAROo1YKxc7b0VET_-Yefo8dz0ktoThHUcteAt6Rr5"> Jasper is not a substance that was merely created by God. First it was created, and then it was transformed. All precious transparent stones, especially diamonds, are transformed substances. Diamond is carbon that has been transformed through heat and pressure into a pure crystal. None of us was created jasper. Rather, we were created clay (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108643" data-verses="Genesis 2:7">Gen. 2:7</span>). Praise the Lord that we have been regenerated and that we are being transformed! Many of us are daily undergoing the process of transformation. Eventually, we shall be precious stones. We shall be jasper, possessing the <span class="pg" data-page-id="711" id="711">[711]</span> life of God and bearing the appearance of God. We shall have the very element of God and the same appearance as He. God looks like jasper, and we also shall look like jasper. When we look at one another, we shall see in one another the appearance of God. Even the least one among us will look like God. </p>
<p data-content-id="yIistfmiI2_aDzgmmvCwMJLHAtoHX6jpV_WNoVoXfyhbv9uKSdjFfOREsc87szYIq"> Do you think that, after we all have the substance, color, and appearance of jasper, we shall still debate or hold differing opinions? Certainly not! The New Jerusalem may be called a jasper city; it is not a city of wood. One day this city will appear bearing a bright green color to express God. In New Jerusalem we shall not express a German character, a British character, a Chinese character, an American character, or any other human character. Instead, we shall express the unique character, the divine character, which is God Himself in His appearance. The church today must also be like this. In such a church we all express God. </p>
<p data-content-id="8xVo-B7NrMY0kPDgZqBD43ILPqL-R9mwuq3Joqe2LOC9AD1rboXiIgCBQAwKW-c3U"> We have seen that the city of New Jerusalem is solidly and substantially golden. This indicates that the whole church should be solidly and substantially of the divine nature. This is the content of the church. The church must not have anything other than God Himself in His nature as its substance and content. Now we also see that the wall of the city bears God’s appearance. To all people and to the whole universe the church must express God Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="06HaLz-rodl0AfizE_p5q65Grw--hy05Vzf9t1pdh1RDT-1G6VyoGGe03xNQWK59K"> The building of the church depends upon the substantial content of the church life. If the content is not God Himself, it will be impossible to have the genuine and proper building. But if our content is the divine nature, this content will transform us and even conform us to His image. Through this transformation, all our different concepts, views, and opinions will be swallowed up. This is what it means to be transformed by the renewing of our mind, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108644" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Romans 12:2</span>. The mind is renewed by the content of the church, the divine nature. When the divine nature occupies the inner part of the church and becomes its content, it will renew our mind and swallow up our different understandings, concepts, views, and opinions. The more the divine <span class="pg" data-page-id="712" id="712">[712]</span> nature fills us from within, the more our concepts and opinions are spontaneously laid aside. As a result we no longer have a natural understanding of things. Rather, our concept is according to the divine nature. Hence, spontaneously we become of the same mind and opinion, we speak the same thing, and we have the unique expression, the appearance of God, and we are built up in this expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="7_7f53lSdKfhS9KELOla9Lykb-e_GEkQZ68G2Q-ukinNeICCXYLfJ8k0uws0cEQC4"> Suppose you cling to your natural concept, and I hold to my natural view. Both your concept and my view may be very good, not at all sinful. But because our concepts are different, they cannot be of the same jasper. However, when we are both filled with the divine nature and swallowed up by it, our concepts will be changed, and we shall all be of the same jasper. Then we shall have one mind, one concept, and one opinion. This is the way to be built into the church. We must drop all our different expressions that we may be built into the same wall and may all have the unique expression of God. </p>

<p data-content-id="LT7GHt_97QehEFI0vw7uvsMOvmfI6pLJAK6-4yadHVCpNEmCwmz8MPsIjIZIRoY7N"> In this message we shall cover two very crucial aspects of New Jerusalem—its gates and its street. Undoubtedly, the city proper, the wall, and the foundations are very important. However, if the New Jerusalem had no gates, there would be no way to enter into it. In that case, this city would not be at all practical; it would be good only for exhibition. But because the New Jerusalem has twelve gates, it is very practical. </p>
<p data-content-id="mQZCaUskgKXnWQwz5-GjAk8SpRtCcEcUewFvjwcuYXvkPdWSc6wkDFGa6M3STyygs"> Some ministries are good. However, because these ministries have no gates and no streets, there is no way to actually enter into what they have to offer. The special character of Brother Nee’s ministry is that whenever he ministered a particular matter, he always gave you a clear view of the way to enter into it. Many talk about <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108656" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans chapters five</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108657" data-verses="Romans 6:1">six</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108658" data-verses="Romans 7:1">seven</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108659" data-verses="Romans 8:1">eight</span>. But no matter how much they talk about these chapters, they do not give you the way to get into them. Brother Nee’s book, <em>The Normal Christian Life,</em> on the contrary, shows us the gates and a definite way to practice what this book describes. The more you read this book, the more you can see the gates it provides for you. Although I appreciated certain other ministries in the past, I eventually discovered that there was no way to enter into what was being presented. The ones who had those ministries could show me a beautiful building in the air that I could admire, but they provided no practical way for me to enter into it. The ministry in the Lord’s recovery today continues the <span class="pg" data-page-id="720" id="720">[720]</span> principle of Brother Nee’s ministry. Everything we minister is presented in a practical way. Hence, you have a way to enter into what the ministry provides you. Likewise, New Jerusalem is practical. Its practicality is seen in its gates and in its street. No matter from what direction you approach this city, you have a way to enter into it. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZwRw-sIjrvKZJVrX9K-LjtjuShW2XzATTWw_AihsrUNSru4xxjkdO4VC6khkUMgY3"> This matter of practicality has caused me to lose a number of good, intimate friends in the Lord. Once I was invited to England to stay with a brother who had an outstanding ministry. While I was there, this brother and I had a number of long conversations lasting two to three hours each. All our conversations concerned the practicality of the Body of Christ. We both had seen the Body, God’s present testimony, and the principle of resurrection life. I could echo what this brother had seen, and he could echo what I had seen, especially regarding the Lord’s Body. However, there was a difference between us. Through the help of Brother Nee, I had seen the practicality of the Body and was burdened to take care of this. But those related to this ministry in England did not care for the practical aspect. Eventually, through our lengthy conversations, I learned that this brother had only the view of the Body, but no practical way to experience it. He neither saw this practicality nor was willing to see it. I made it clear to him that we wanted not only the vision of the Body, but also the practicality of the Body. In my concern for the practicality of the church, I have published the book entitled, <em>The Practical Expression of the Church.</em> Although I have lost some dear friends over the matter of the practicality of the church, the way is still the way. During the more than eighteen years since my visit with this brother in England, the Lord has vindicated the practicality of the church. </p>

Thus, the city lies square (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108661" data-verses="Revelation 21:16">v. 16</span>), with three gates on each of its four sides. The east side at the front, toward the glory of the sunrising, ranks first; the north side at the top ranks second; the south side at the bottom ranks third; and the west side at the rear ranks fourth. The gates on the four sides are toward the four directions of the earth, signifying the availability of the entrance of the holy city to all the peoples on earth. (Compare with the four heads of the river in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108662" data-verses="Genesis 2:10-14">Genesis 2:10-14</span>.) </p>

The Triune God Being Available to All People</h2><p data-content-id="sgITvoUbLp9kr7so-lifik0UBjCc_l2aWiA8xIiSnO6y-U0RpWzmI90zjb8ycRLz9"> The three gates on each side signify that the Triune God—Father, Son, and Spirit—work together to bring people into the holy city. This is indicated in the three parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108663" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span> and implied in the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108664" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>. The three parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108665" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span> concern the shepherd and the lost sheep, the woman and the lost coin, and the father and the returned prodigal son. The shepherd refers to the Son; the father, of course, to the Father; and the woman signifies the Spirit. In order for a sinner to be brought back to the Father’s house, there is the need of the Son, the shepherd, to bring back the lost sheep; there is the need of the Spirit to enlighten the hearts of people that they may repent; and there is the need of the Father to receive the returned and repentant prodigal son. Hence, the Triune God is the entrance into the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="w61C8Sf0pRjO1CqIL2kXUnSo-uZG3VbXzFDh5Au7smcx1nKys-XlikrZOIVeRdjoV"> The fact that the Triune God is working to bring people into the holy city is also implied in the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108666" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>. To be baptized into the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is the entrance into the holy city. Thus, the Father, Son, and Spirit are the three gates on each side of the city. The three gates are not on three sides respectively; rather, there are three gates on each of the four sides repeatedly. The gates on any one of the sides are exactly the same as the <span class="pg" data-page-id="722" id="722">[722]</span> gates on the other three sides. This indicates that the Triune God is available to people in all four corners of the earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="LT7GHt_97QehEFI0vw7uvsMOvmfI-67JAK6-4yadHVCpNEmCwmz8MPsIjIZIRoY7N"> The three gates indicate that the Triune God has come to reach us and to bring us into His eternal economy. The three in the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, have come out in God’s economy to reach us and to bring us back to His economy. A number of verses in the New Testament speak of the Triune God. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108667" data-verses="Ephesians 3:14-17">Ephesians 3:14 through 17</span> Paul said, “I bow my knees unto the Father... that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man; that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.” In these verses we see the Father, the Spirit, and Christ, the Son. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108668" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">Second Corinthians 13:14</span> also unfolds the Triune God: “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.” In this verse the three of the Godhead are for His dispensing, for His going out and coming in, that is, for His spreading out and our entering in. </p>
<p data-content-id="mQZCaUskgKXnWQwz5-GjAk8SpRtCbXcUewFvjwcuYXvkPdWSc6wkDFGa6M3STyygs"> The first mention of man in the whole Bible speaks of him in relation to the Triune God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108669" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> says, “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” The “us” in this verse refers to the Triune God. Thus, in the verse where man is first mentioned, God is alluded to as being triune. If God were not triune, He would not be able to dispense Himself into us, to work Himself into us, and to mingle Himself with us. But because God is triune, He can enter into human beings. The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow. In this way, the Triune God comes into us. </p>

The Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. In the Old Testament the tabernacle of God was the precursor, or the forerunner, of the temple of God. New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108686" data-verses="Revelation 21:3">v. 3</span>) will be the temple of God. This indicates that in the new heaven and new earth the temple of God will be enlarged into a city. The three equal dimensions of the city (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108687" data-verses="Revelation 21:16">v. 16</span>) indicate that the whole city will be the Holy of Holies, the inner temple. Hence, there will be no temple in it. </p>
<p data-content-id="ITBVDgsapCA5h0Ba51FA5D5vi5Ku3jamvrF7YxN5-1GluETQyeBTiS_tmIqIxEe99"> The Greek word for <em>temple</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108688" data-verses="Revelation 21:22">verse 22</span>, <em>naos,</em> does not denote the whole temple in a common way including the Holy of Holies and the Holy Place. Rather, it denotes the inner temple, the Holy of Holies. This inner temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb, signifying that God and the Lamb will be the place in which we serve God. The holy city as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and God and the Lamb as the temple are for us to dwell in. In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for both God and man for eternity. <span class="pg" data-page-id="732" id="732">[732]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="dqTRyG6GA884EmjvR4UyOegfLJhGULNc9pTPOwHALeZwBCUtG7wCY77G5UKUOOnaQ"> The entire city of New Jerusalem is the Holy of Holies, and God and the Lamb are the temple in this city. If we put these two points together, we shall realize that this city is God and the Lamb. Because the whole city is the Holy of Holies and because the inner temple is God and the Lamb, the city is God and the Lamb. </p>
<p data-content-id="QpDUAnrDI_WRFtrr3f3Kzh9t6b_EEQi3lhyUHZa2seNBxZHOZbMQUNSElYwe-H2bi"> Furthermore, the whole city is called the tabernacle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108689" data-verses="Revelation 21:3">v. 3</span>). Just as a boy is the precursor of a man, so the tabernacle is the precursor of the temple. Before the temple appears, there is the tabernacle. But when the tabernacle comes into its fullness, it becomes the temple. Therefore, we need to keep three points before us: that the whole city is the Holy of Holies; that the temple is God Himself and the Lamb; and that the whole city is the tabernacle. When we put all these points together, we see that God Himself is the whole city of New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="KieXqJ7jgoER4UdfBfZNeFTKyiH-sPhh6wo2bjONxSaxFCktk5VChNS7qxKtiNlUj"> However, as we have pointed out elsewhere, the whole city of New Jerusalem is also a living composition of all God’s redeemed ones. On the one hand, God is the entire city; on the other hand, the city is a living composition of the redeemed. If you find this difficult to grasp with your natural mind, let me ask you this question: Do we not say that the church today is Christ, and do we not also say that it is a composition of all the believers? On the one hand, the church is a composition of all the believers; on the other hand, Christ is both the Head and the Body. Hence, we have the term, the Body-Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108690" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:12">First Corinthians 12:12</span> indicates that Christ is not only the Head, but also the Body: “For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.” The principle in both the church and New Jerusalem is the same. </p>
<p data-content-id="lNulM8LrKW8XhGNjyhb8z8_RGARcvEBrAM_UAfWfx_DwAjiko112RRWMunPS7zWYR"> The church is the enlargement of Christ. Christ Himself is the individual Christ, but the church is the corporate Christ, Christ enlarged and expanded. Therefore, the church is Christ’s expansion, Christ’s enlargement. In like manner, New Jerusalem is the enlargement and the expansion of the Triune God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="733" id="733">[733]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="OPc0C_l9lbNcoMQBRuTefKizMoJFY0ZNF3gAaE0-NZcyLxO2KT0pWsR4uiaTts0_i"> Many religious people will not agree with such a statement because they lack experience. Some would even slander us, saying that we teach evolution into God. Although we repudiate this slanderous accusation, we do say that we are the expansion of God and the enlargement of God. After those who oppose and criticize us today are perfected, they may say, “Brother Lee, you were right. We apologize for opposing you. When we were in the dispensation of grace, we did not have the experience. For this reason, we were so foolish as to oppose you. But we were dealt with during the dispensation of the kingdom, and we have been perfected. Now that we are together in eternity, we want to be reconciled to you and ask you to forgive us.” If any will say this, I will tell them that I forgave them already in the dispensation of grace. Sooner or later, in this age, in the next age, or in eternity, those who are opposing us will have to admit that the ultimate revelation of the Bible portrays the New Jerusalem as the enlargement of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="4GbJibLcKEjqL__jjhGizlp70d9oj_c18dd9DdMU_NFm4J0W2ehtPh_Rk31LQn9uY"> The New Jerusalem is both the temple and the tabernacle. This means that New Jerusalem will not only be the enlargement of God, the temple, but also the tabernacle, God and the Lamb overshadowing His redeemed with Himself as the tabernacle. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108691" data-verses="Revelation 7:15">Revelation 7:15</span>, speaking of the great multitude serving God in the heavenly temple, says, “Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits upon the throne shall spread His tabernacle over them.” God shall overshadow His redeemed ones by spreading Himself over them. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108692" data-verses="Psalms 90:1">Psalm 90:1</span> Moses said, “Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.” Moses knew that God Himself is our eternal dwelling place, our eternal habitation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108693" data-verses="Psalms 90:1">Psalm 90</span> is a prophecy of this. I do not care to live in a heavenly mansion. I prefer to dwell in God, even in the enlargement of God. Our natural mind would never think that we could dwell in God. Nevertheless, the entire city of New Jerusalem will be God Himself as our habitation. The expansion and the enlargement of God will be our eternal city in which we shall dwell <span class="pg" data-page-id="734" id="734">[734]</span> for eternity. All of God’s redeemed will serve and dwell in God and the Lamb as the temple. </p>
<p data-content-id="oD3lMOXIl6z0Onm43O-zok5YjtXXaof6DEIcHzOKTKEbP0Se8eYZQKaye2uoCCFov"> In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, the tabernacle was the precursor of the temple. When the Lord Jesus was incarnated, He tabernacled among us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108694" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>) and He was also the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108695" data-verses="John 2:19-21">John 2:19-21</span>). Today, the church is the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108696" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:16">1 Cor. 3:16</span>). These two terms, tabernacle and temple, are used again and again in the Bible. Hence, if we would know the New Jerusalem, we must study all the portions in the Old Testament and the New Testament concerning the tabernacle and the temple. Strictly speaking, the tabernacle was not mainly for people to dwell in; it was for God’s habitation. Eventually, New Jerusalem will be the habitation of both God and man. This means that it will be a mutual habitation. God will be our dwelling place, and we shall be His dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="38DbLjkjfrpGOnLvrDZzvLBG1nkAFnnT0zpiuZ_ALgyZ1yVY5W1UVpbk1LrYnnGZ3"> We have a miniature of this mutual habitation in the Lord’s word, “Abide in Me, and I in you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108697" data-verses="John 15:4">John 15:4</span>). To abide in the Lord means to take Him as our dwelling, as our habitation. When we take the Lord as our dwelling, He abides in us. This abiding is mutual, for we abide in the Lord, and He abides in us. There is no need to wait until the coming New Jerusalem to abide in the Lord and to have Him abide in us. I can testify strongly that many times I know that I am truly in the Lord and that He is actually abiding in Me. Even this morning I abode in Him and He abode in me. Although this is difficult to explain, it is nonetheless a fact in our experience. We all can testify that whenever we abide in Him, we immediately sense that He is abiding in us. If you say, “Lord Jesus, how I thank You that right now I am abiding in You,” you will immediately have the deep sense that He is abiding in you. Wherever you are, at home, at work, or at school, you can say, “O Lord Jesus, I am abiding in You right now,” and something within you will say, “And I am abiding in you.” This is a miniature of the coming New Jerusalem, which will simply be a mutual abiding place for us and for God and the Lamb. <span class="pg" data-page-id="735" id="735">[735]</span> </p>

The New Jerusalem also has a center, which is the throne of our redeeming God, the throne of God and of the Lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108720" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">22:1</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="qFT3je7o6rEOFRguDp8CG0dTgpKY9eLv-CuesvcrtybeUNGaiOI26ePMHk72T6-ua"> We have pointed out that in the first section of this book (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108721" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">1:1—11:19</span>) the throne of God is the center and that in the second section (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108722" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">12:1—22:21</span>) the temple of God is the center. We have also considered the phrase “out of the temple from the throne” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108723" data-verses="Revelation 16:17">16:17</span>, see messages forty-nine and fifty, pp. 568-570, 572-573, 575-576). At the end of the book of Revelation, the throne of God is in the temple. Thus, the throne and temple have become one. </p>
<p data-content-id="yIistfmiI2_aDzgmmvCwMJLHAsYHeoDpV_WNoVoXfyhbv9uKSdjFfOREsc87szYIq"> Our God is not only the God on the throne for His administration, nor only the God in the temple for His expression. He is the very God on the throne in the temple for His expression through His administration. God’s throne is for His administration, and God’s temple is for His expression. The fact that the throne is in the temple means that God’s administration is for His expression. All that God administrates is that He might be expressed. In eternity future God’s throne will be in the center of New Jerusalem, and His expression will extend to the circumference.

In eternity, the very God who will sit on the throne is our redeeming God, from whose throne proceeds the river of water of life for our supply and satisfaction. This depicts how the Triune God—God, the Lamb, and the Spirit, symbolized by the water of life—dispenses Himself into His redeemed under His headship (implied in the authority of the throne) for eternity. </p>
<p data-content-id="FrpbcRt3yRk0Uxjm1URW7Eg05gWMicIpTrxPj1VjX3CdPg4WUZDe1ebWLRh8zhLuo"> Notice that there are not two thrones, one for God and another for the Lamb. According to the traditional terms used in Christianity, the reference to God and the Lamb means that two distinct Persons, God and the Lamb, are on one throne. How could God and the Lamb sit on one throne? Do they sit side by side? In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108725" data-verses="Revelation 21:23">21:23</span> we find a clue to the correct answer to these questions. In this verse God is likened to light and the Lamb is likened to a lamp. The light and the lamp cannot be separated; neither can they stand side by side. Rather, the light shines out from within the lamp. Therefore, God as the light is in the Lamb as the lamp. God and the Lamb are not sitting side by side; rather, the very God is within the Lamb as the lamp and shines out through Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Cs3ONxeMth5mwllbyYf4lOgkLyl9uaDV8RSd8O8Hqv0o7uTpEdoOJ6dbZT0nyJr-e"> I would like to see how those who use the traditional teachings of the Trinity to oppose us would explain how God and the Lamb are on the same throne. It is better not to use the term person; for by using it we become entangled and are not able to understand the Bible thoroughly according to the pure Word. The Bible reveals that God is the light and that the Lamb is the lamp. Eventually, because the light is in the lamp, these are not two entities; they are one entity in two aspects. It is very difficult to explain the Trinity in human language because we simply do not have the <span class="pg" data-page-id="741" id="741">[741]</span> vocabulary or the terminology to express it adequately. Although we do not have the proper words, we do have a picture of God as light and of Christ, the Lamb, as the lamp.

The one street in this city eventually leads to the throne. The Lord Jesus came down to earth from His throne that He might bring God into man. This is the Triune God coming out of Himself to reach mankind. When we received Him into us, we were baptized into Him. Baptism is the real entrance into the Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108726" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matt. 28:19</span>, Gk.), and the entrance into the Triune God is the initial entrance into New Jerusalem.

It is by His administration that God dispenses Himself into us as life, as the life supply, and as the eternal, absolute, all-inclusive grace. His dispensing of Himself into us depends upon His administration. For this reason, in the church life today there is divine authority and church government. There is a divine government in the church life today, and this government comes from the throne of God. The divine authority in the church is for God to dispense Himself into us as life, as the life supply, and as the all-sufficient grace.

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="BM6WPQDgbT__QB93oHAQLnlaZ-E1uj3XBIVTiOGoM8gwQ4MS1D6UUKO84G9MHWJh_">THE ENJOYMENT AND BLESSING<br/>OF GOD’S REDEEMED IN ETERNITY</h1><p data-content-id="xsF1VTQ6uNmvQ0gsEZfYs9IbNRYTBSFzV_mWIqnjliKoXml2ZS6zTzBkq4NzheEv5"> The basic numbers in New Jerusalem are the numbers twelve and one. One is the unique number. There is one God, one city, one throne, one street, one river, and one tree of life. Hence, the number one is the basic number of the church and of God’s building in His economy. This is not my concept; it is Paul’s concept in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108791" data-verses="Ephesians 4:3-6">Ephesians 4:3-6</span>, where he speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father. We have just one God, one throne, one administration, one authority, one flow, one way, and one tree. If we have seen this, we shall be kept forever in this oneness. </p>
<p data-content-id="rFrCGjzy0s3seaoP5ZFz1WE5aB8BC8Jn7QPczLYQpR6KGf-mSZlvxLAT6G-4WlYEl"> This oneness issues from the unique God, the One who is the source of everything. The throne, the river, the street, and the tree all issue out of Him. He is the unique source of everything to produce, support, sustain, and keep the unique building of the one God. </p>
<p data-content-id="dqTRyG6GA884EmjvR4UyOegfLJBGTZtc9pTPOwHALeZwBCUtG7wCY77G5UKUOOnaQ"> The situation of today’s Christianity is vastly different from this. Christianity is filled with confusion and division. There are thousands of divisions in today’s Christianity. No one knows how many divisions have taken place in the so-called free groups. In the free groups nearly everybody claims to be something. How we thank the Lord that He has opened our eyes and shown us His unique way! We have nothing other than the unique God on the unique throne with the unique flow with the unique life supply. Therefore, we have one testimony and we are in one church. </p>
<p data-content-id="QpDUAnrDI_WRFtrr3f3Kzh9t6bfECCS3lhyUHZa2seNBxZHOZbMQUNSElYwe-H2bi"> The church is constituted of both divinity and humanity; it is one corporate entity of both God and man. This entity is both God’s dwelling and our abode, for now we abide in God, <span class="pg" data-page-id="756" id="756">[756]</span> and God abides in us. The church life today is a miniature of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. We in the church can testify that we are truly one. We are one in God, one in His authority, one in His expression, one in the flow, one in the life, and one in the tree. In this oneness we abide in God, God abides in us, and thus we become His testimony. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KieXqJ7jgoER4UdfBfZNeFTKyin-ldhh6wo2bjONxSaxFCktk5VChNS7qxKtiNlUj">I. THE HOLY CITY</h2><p data-content-id="lNulM8LrKW8XhGNjyhb8z8_RGAxcnWRrAM_UAfWfx_DwAjiko112RRWMunPS7zWYR"> In this message we shall cover the enjoyment and blessing of God’s redeemed in eternity. The first crucial item of our enjoyment in eternity will be the holy city (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108792" data-verses="Revelation 22:14">22:14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108793" data-verses="Revelation 22:19">19</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108794" data-verses="Revelation 22:19">Revelation 22:19</span> says, “And if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.” This indicates that having a part in the holy city means a great deal to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="GYIVpUWkuZmHSrN-tf6YUfoxs6P6wp2-OL81T49tkhetZaHINSoSt6T3Ue9-usg-C"> The holy city in which we shall participate and which we shall enjoy is God mingled with all His saints. In this one entity, the holy city, we shall not only enjoy God; we shall also enjoy God in all the saints. We shall enjoy God in one another, and we shall enjoy one another in God. I shall enjoy you in God, and you will enjoy me in God. Although this enjoyment is rather mysterious, we have a foretaste of it in the church life today, where we enjoy God in one another and one another in God. What a divine, heavenly communal life this is! </p>
<p data-content-id="cgfMaJYFAO1mOpI22kRdhJ3Kcb1LUUAHK7fr4_AyvD4ITdSSCh7v-cnqPDc7CCaPG"> Man was created by God with the desire for a communal life. Our human nature longs for a community life. In order to fulfill this desire, people attend nightclubs and parties. However, nightclubs and parties cannot meet this need. Although people hunger and thirst for a proper communal life, they are poisoned by the clubs and parties of the world. Instead of receiving the proper drink to quench their thirst, they are poisoned. There is only one kind of party that is pure, happy, nourishing, enlightening, satisfying, and edifying, and that is the church. Day after day, we in the church life are attending a heavenly party. This party is holy, divine, <span class="pg" data-page-id="757" id="757">[757]</span> and spiritual. It is the party of God mingled with man. What an enjoyment it is to attend this party! </p>
<p data-content-id="Yf-rmGLmzs8DVJKAZqsHcn6KgB6m3MQpwCL8YYxWWYsYffHyYsR_Jf62ch9moi03S"> Through my experience in the church life of nearly fifty years, I have come to know the disposition of the young people. Young people are sharp and quite demanding, and they can pierce into the hearts of their parents or of the elders in the church. All the elders are targets for the arrows of the young people. Often I have said to some of these sharp young people, “If the church and the elders are not pleasant in your eyes, why don’t you go off somewhere, to the mountains, perhaps, and live by yourselves? Then you will no longer be troubled by the church or the elders.” They replied that because they enjoy the fellowship in the church life, they would never leave the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="EquHWEovemLQ65DjOF9kgzpp8tCOE2OsiQtpIkUhAc0HmLnNxgDapPV_nZlY4Z7aR"> Our desire for a communal life cannot be fully satisfied even by our married life or family life. You may have many brothers, sisters, cousins, nieces, nephews, and other relatives, but they cannot satisfy your inward desire for a community life. This desire, a desire for the church life and a desire created by God, can be satisfied only in the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="D08BEZDWCoGzl9aRgkuTZIQBwEzk0-zSwTEtOAeTiI-pN0qDlIp5_x909EdoSb6yb"> We Christians are like sheep flocking together. Years ago I observed some flocks of sheep in Scotland. I noticed that the sheep enjoyed flocking together. They traveled together, ate together, and lay down together. They were always together as a flock. We Christians also have such a desire, the desire for the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="S7HLy_RJGMBEkAmzzlkouqJfm_Ql1-BRvkQKX5yY3Yp0fuXWbDKB9XsII8Y1-HQSk"> How we enjoy God in the church life! Some may say, “God is omnipresent, and I can enjoy Him anywhere. I can enjoy Him at home or on the street. I don’t need the church life to enjoy God.” We can testify that there is no comparison between the enjoyment of God in the church and the enjoyment of God apart from the church. Yes, you may enjoy God anywhere, but not in the way we enjoy Him in the church. In the church life we are beside ourselves with the enjoyment of the Lord. The church life is a life of God mingled with man. In this wonderful mingled life, we daily enjoy God in all the dear saints, and we enjoy the dear saints in God. This enjoyment is the first aspect of our eternal portion in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="758" id="758">[758]</span> holy city. The enjoyment of this city, which is a composition of God mingled with all the saints, is our eternal portion. In this holy city God and the Lamb will be our dwelling for rest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108795" data-verses="Revelation 21:3">21:3</span>). In the holy city we also enjoy God and the Lamb as our temple for serving and worshipping God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108796" data-verses="Revelation 21:22">21:22</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gmeJHU6Nz9bHbq5NUV6eCQpdKBEbNIgabNE5d2gHsrIOUvw44xUHcApdW5D5Qezd4">II. THE TREE OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="eMGG8SZW5aKYwACjfS3uY0Bv6NL8e6_pNMYqz5sYFrO7IjSJfZqHiVhS_6SOouZ-_"> The second item of our enjoyment in eternity is the tree of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108797" data-verses="Revelation 22:14">22:14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108798" data-verses="Revelation 22:19">19</span>). The tree of life is nothing less than Christ, the Son of God, the redeeming Lamb, as our life supply. This tree is rich, fresh, and refreshing. We have been redeemed that we may have the right to come to the tree of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="5gvNTj0qyHK7fxM7muDqwkXAE8G1IeIvbfrgDct-kby-g5UvD45-QA3Mzygn6Yx6f"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108799" data-verses="Revelation 22:14">Revelation 22:14</span> says, “Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city.” This verse may be considered a promise for the enjoyment of the tree of life, which is Christ with all the riches of life; and the second half of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108800" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">verse 17</span> may be considered a call to take the water of life, which is the life-giving Spirit. Thus, the book of Revelation ends in a promise and a call, both of which are for eating the all-inclusive Christ and drinking Him as the life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="Np0A3NXGY9sb0kEPalq_4D5F1A7cx5DsiVnvh4Vd3iry7xMwdQWdiN4zotccxw5rB"> After his creation, man was put before the tree of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108801" data-verses="Genesis 2:8-9">Gen. 2:8-9</span>), indicating that he was privileged to partake of it. But due to the fall of man, the tree of life was closed to man by God’s glory, holiness, and righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108802" data-verses="Genesis 3:24">Gen. 3:24</span>). Through Christ’s redemption, which has fulfilled all the requirements of God’s glory, holiness, and righteousness, the way to the tree of life is opened again to believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108803" data-verses="Hebrews 10:19-20">Heb. 10:19-20</span>). Hence, the believers who wash their robes in the redeeming blood of Christ have the right to enjoy the tree of life as their eternal portion in the holy city, the paradise of God in eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108804" data-verses="Revelation 2:7">2:7</span>). </p>

In this message we shall consider the various items found in this conclusion. </p>
<p data-content-id="cgfMaJYFAO1mOpI22kRdhJ3KcblLQGwHK7fr4_AyvD4ITdSSCh7v-cnqPDc7CCaPG"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108825" data-verses="Revelation 22:6">Verse 6</span> says, “And he said to me, These words are faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His slaves the things which must swiftly take place.” The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, who sent His angel to show the things in this book, is the Lord Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108826" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">1:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108827" data-verses="Revelation 22:16">22:16</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108828" data-verses="Revelation 22:16">Verse 16</span> says, “I Jesus have sent Mine angel to testify to you these things for the churches.” The testimony of this book was given by the Lord Jesus for the churches. Hence, to comprehend and keep it, we need to be in the churches and for the churches. </p>
<p data-content-id="Yf-rmGLmzs8DVJKAZqsHcn6KgBqmweQpwCL8YYxWWYsYffHyYsR_Jf62ch9moi03S"> In this book the Lord God is called the God of the spirits of the prophets. This indicates that all the prophecies in this book are inspired by the very God who inspired the spirits of the prophets in both the Old and New Testaments. It also indicates that these prophecies are related to those in the Old and New Testaments, all of which were spoken by the prophets in their spirit under the inspiration of God. Hence, to comprehend these prophecies, we also need to be in our spirit under God’s anointing. </p>

WARNING THAT THE LORD IS COMING SOON</h2><p data-content-id="D08BEZDWCoGzl9aRgkuTZIQBwEjk9tTSwTEtOAeTiI-pN0qDlIp5_x909EdoSb6yb"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108829" data-verses="Revelation 22:7">verses 7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108830" data-verses="Revelation 22:12">12</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108831" data-verses="Revelation 22:20">20</span> we have the warning that the Lord is coming soon. In each of these verses the Lord Jesus said, “I come quickly.” This is the Lord’s warning. If we take heed to this warning, we shall be blessed; otherwise, we shall forfeit the blessing. Do not think that because the Lord has been tolerating the situation for more than nineteen <span class="pg" data-page-id="766" id="766">[766]</span> centuries, He is slow to come back. Look at the world situation today. We do not know what will happen within the next few days. In this age, things happen very quickly. Therefore, we must pray and be watchful. We must also be prepared in spirit and in our daily life. May the Lord cover us that we may be a watchful, praying, and prepared people. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="S7HLy_RJGMBEkAmzzlkouqJfm_Al9txRvkQKX5yY3Yp0fuXWbDKB9XsII8Y1-HQSk">II. BLESSING OF KEEPING THE WORDS<br/>OF THE PROPHECY OF THIS BOOK</h2><p data-content-id="2dKAFOptUaVJ1O8CsbCZpWVpYc3feVbrD3ZULTjfRG56qNxhXho1DQvZyTnlBjLC6"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108832" data-verses="Revelation 22:7">verse 7</span> the Lord also says, “Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.” Here the Lord tells us clearly that if we keep the words of this prophecy, we shall be blessed. The Lord spoke a very similar word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108833" data-verses="Revelation 1:3">1:3</span>. There He said, “Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and keep what is written in it.” This book was written mainly for the blessing of God upon His people. Whether or not we shall share in this blessing depends upon how we deal with the words in this book. We must take these words and keep them. Those who do so will be blessed. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="udGqnkRQe0Fa75Rq062nBbUbEMeCv8JuLLQkayoHbSEK216rHpUxhj5eVqRJadTMc">III. WARNING NOT TO SEAL<br/>THE PROPHECY OF THIS BOOK</h2><p data-content-id="fGUGkn5to2I5UFoKv1VNdQtvhdBTtEpfFL58bNBasS6Otne5-f2c6FWgAyNaUaldn"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108834" data-verses="Revelation 22:10">Verse 10</span> says, “And he said to me, Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.” Daniel’s prophecies were sealed, because they were given long before the time of the end, whereas the prophecies of this book should not be sealed because the time is near. Instead of being sealed, the book of Revelation should be constantly open to us and to others. For centuries, however, this book was closed and, along with the rest of the Bible, kept away from the people by the Roman Catholic Church. Through Martin Luther the Bible was made available to the people, but not much of it was opened to them. Having read through all the messages of this life-study, we can no longer say that the book of Revelation is closed to us. This book has truly been opened to the saints. Therefore, do not let this book be sealed to you or to others. Rather, you must keep the book <span class="pg" data-page-id="767" id="767">[767]</span> open by plunging into every aspect of this prophecy and by diving into the flow. The more we live in the word of this book, the more open it will be to us. If we do this, the book of Revelation will be kept open to us, our family, and all the people around us. </p>
<p data-content-id="ITBVDgsapCA5h0Ba51FA5D5vi56u_xKmvrF7YxN5-1GluETQyeBTiS_tmIqIxEe99"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108835" data-verses="Revelation 22:11">Verse 11</span> says, “He who does unrighteousness, let him still do unrighteousness; and he who is filthy, let him still be made filthy; and he who is righteous, let him still do righteousness; and he who is holy, let him still be made holy.” Whether anyone is unrighteous or righteous, filthy or holy, is a serious matter in the age of this book. To be righteous is to walk according to the righteous ways of God outwardly, whereas to be holy is to live according to the holy nature of God inwardly. In the age of this book, we must walk and live in this way that we may receive the reward; otherwise, we shall be condemned as unrighteous and filthy and receive punishment at the Lord’s coming back (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108836" data-verses="Revelation 22:12">v. 12</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Huy9VfbmqOU-Xs8Ud1qttbqEYp42jqC36RmXphwWDhi5Es85PdREqM_9KTAokR4Qe"> Anyone who hardens himself and who does not keep this book open to himself or himself open to this book will remain in his pitiful condition. If he is unrighteous and filthy, he will remain unrighteous and filthy. However, if you are righteous and holy and keep yourself open to this book and this book open to you, you will continue to be righteous and holy. This means that if you keep this word open to you, you will continually become more holy and righteous. But if you do not keep it open, you will become more unrighteous and more filthy, remaining in that pitiful situation until the time of judgment comes. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Xi707fcPG3tgdRrB8u8nSWR75muqUSKy3SAVJIWn_neLMO9oHqhEzON_RcU2wxzw1">IV. WARNING CONCERNING THE LORD’S REWARD</h2><p data-content-id="kJtprzMv-iEybgkzNyzDTDV_C5nZ36PsrUhhtuCMESGHnnFsJwP3wtj5eeGMBki0p"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108837" data-verses="Revelation 22:12">Verse 12</span> says, “Behold, I come quickly, and My reward is with Me to render to each one according to his work.” “I come quickly” is the Lord’s repeated warning that we may consider His reward at His coming back. The Greek word translated <em>reward</em> means “wages.” At the Lord’s coming, this reward will be rendered to each one of the believers, after their rapture, at the judgment seat of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108838" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:10">2 Cor. 5:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108839" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:5">1 Cor. 4:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108840" data-verses="Romans 14:10">Rom. 14:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108841" data-verses="Matthew 16:27">Matt. 16:27</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="768" id="768">[768]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="J-GpZUZ4kVBIvd5R8J1AINvauhEqQCAAjWB7RQPvz7P22_9iz4SIUft-9nE0gzGry"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108842" data-verses="Revelation 22:13">Verse 13</span> says, “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the beginning and the end.” This is the Lord’s declaration at the close of this book, corresponding to what God declared in the opening of this book (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108843" data-verses="Revelation 1:8">1:8</span>). This indicates that the Lord Jesus is the very God. The very Lord whom we serve is the Alpha and the Omega. He is the first letter, the last letter, and all the letters in between. This means that He is able and qualified to accomplish all that is spoken concerning Him in this book. We should not excuse ourselves and say, “This vision is marvelous, but it is too high for me. I cannot attain it.” The Lord is the Alpha and the Omega to back up and to carry out His word. We must exercise our entire being to believe in His word. Do not look at yourself, reckon on yourself, or consider yourself. We all are nothing. If we look at ourselves, we shall not be able to do anything. Therefore, we must turn our eyes to Him, set our eyes upon Him, and believe in His word. No matter how far beyond us His word is, we must say “Amen” to whatever He says. Whenever we say “Amen” to His word, we are strengthened and we have a living faith. Faith is not derived from us; it originates with Him. If we look away from all things unto Him, we shall enjoy Him as our Alpha, as our Omega, and as our everything. And He will certainly accomplish everything He has promised in this book. All we need to do is exercise faith in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="zZdlZsx_Xy-tGxScyNm6rM6fClEfIhoMErtkQIYPSIs0hDew6MtdTE2PZ2QGnjo-X"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108844" data-verses="Revelation 22:13">verse 13</span>, the Lord Jesus is not only the First, but also the beginning, not only the Last, but also the end. The first indicates that none is before Him, and the last, that none is after Him, whereas the beginning means that He is the origination of all things, and the end, that He is the consummation of all things. Hence, the indication here is not only that there is nothing before or after the Lord Jesus, but also that there is neither origination nor consummation without Him. This assures us that the Lord is strong to promise, encourage, and strengthen us. He will accomplish whatever He has spoken in this book. </p>

Although He will still be the Triune God, pictured in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108878" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">22:1</span> as God, the Lamb, and the flowing river (the symbol of the Spirit), at that time He will be the center of the New Jerusalem. In eternity past, God was by Himself, but in eternity future, the Triune God will be the center of the New Jerusalem and will saturate the whole city. The portrait of the New Jerusalem in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108879" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">chapters twenty-one and twenty-two</span> is a sign signifying that God will be mingled with His redeemed people as His enlargement. Eventually, this people will be a building. This building, constituted with divinity and humanity, will be a mutual habitation of both God and man. This is the transparent revelation of the Holy Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="UbDmKnrbR6wkXMKUDOIMD2P-mAWyMslZE9lFaopaqfOk7Tikcu1gMU62N3Lsd0fR0"> This revelation includes three main items: the unique God, the created man, and the builded New Jerusalem. These three items cover the whole Bible. When God comes into man, regenerates him, and transforms him, He mingles Himself with man. By mingling Himself with man, God becomes enlarged. The issue of this mingling is the building, <span class="pg" data-page-id="776" id="776">[776]</span> the New Jerusalem. Thus, the New Jerusalem as God’s building is the mingling of God with the created, redeemed, and regenerated man. We all need to have a vision of this marvelous building. </p>

For a while he would be happy, and then there would be a change. At one point he thought he had come into the victorious life, but then things changed once again. But consider how many changes there have been and will be from the time of Adam until the time of the New Jerusalem. The reason you have experienced so many changes is that you have not yet been brought into God’s unchanging building. Until we all have been brought into God’s building, we all shall continue to change. Only after we have come into His building will there be no further change. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108880" data-verses="Revelation 3:12">Revelation 3:12</span> says, “He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore.” This indicates that only after we have been built into the temple of God shall we cease to change. In the meantime, the more we change, the closer we are to the building. Our eternal destiny is to be in God’s building. However, among most Christians today there is no building. Instead, there is continual wandering and shifting. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="i6aa50jw_pYma5-9kQwhXnKKmqwo9jyWJhSG5jnjgpmh3Z1pRGRhjjd60ipXtg60s">THIRTEEN ITEMS</h2><p data-content-id="5gvNTj0qyHK7fxM7muDqwkXAE_m1IcIvbfrgDct-kby-g5UvD45-QA3Mzygn6Yx6f"> In the book of Genesis there are eight important men: Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Eventually, these eight men issued in God’s building. In the Old Testament this building was typified by the tabernacle and the temple. In the New Testament we have the reality of the building. Jesus is the tabernacle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108881" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, Gk.), the church is the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="108882" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:16">1 Cor. 3:16</span>), and the New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation. Altogether there are thirteen items: the eight men in Genesis, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="777" id="777">[777]</span> tabernacle and the temple in type, Jesus and the church in reality, and the New Jerusalem. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Np0A3NXGY9sb0kEPalq_4D5F1Dbcx7DsiVnvh4Vd3iry7xMwdQWdiN4zotccxw5rB">THE LAMPSTAND AND THE SEVEN LAMPS</h2><p data-content-id="tICK0kqpdw83viGh_xTywHd_frRXvWog1o4YjOZhdjbM1vmCFYdIuEXfD_WST4Dgf"> The lampstand was a very crucial item in the tabernacle because it directed people to the ark in the Holy of Holies. Consider the arrangement of the furnishings in the tabernacle and the outer court. Firstly, in the outer court there were the altar and the laver. Then, in the Holy Place, there were the showbread table and the lampstand with seven lamps. The lampstand directed people into the Holy of Holies; it pointed the way to the law of life in the ark of testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="hhHSRpGa6c8nmBYQbhmi3QAUFSovvpnv3LkGuqyF8VwAmEhhWitCawAl83I6gzdpk"> If we had only the book of Exodus, we would not be able to understand the significance of the lampstand and its seven lamps. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108883" data-verses="Zechariah 3:1-2">Zechariah 3 and 4</span> the lampstand with its lamps appears again as a development of the lampstand in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108884" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108885" data-verses="Zechariah 3:9">Zechariah 3:9</span> we have the seven eyes on the stone, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108886" data-verses="Zechariah 4:10">4:10</span> we see that these seven eyes are the eyes of the Lord “which run to and fro through the whole earth.” When we put <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108887" data-verses="Zechariah 4:10">Zechariah 4:10</span> with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108888" data-verses="Zechariah 4:2">Zechariah 4:2</span>, we see that the seven lamps of the lampstand are also the seven eyes of the Lord. Thus, in Zechariah the seven lamps in Exodus are developed into the seven eyes of Jehovah, the Lord. Furthermore, these seven lamps are the seven eyes of the stone. Therefore, in Zechariah the seven lamps are developed into seven eyes, and the lampstand is developed into the stone and into Jehovah, the Lord. Hence, the seven lamps are the seven eyes, and the lampstand is the stone, Jehovah, the Lord. Here we have not only the seven lamps, but also the seven eyes; not only the lampstand, but also the stone, Jehovah. This implies that the seven lamps are the seven eyes and that the lampstand is Jehovah. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UbDmKnrbR6wkXMKUDOIMD2P-mAWyL_FZE9lFaopaqfOk7Tikcu1gMU62N3Lsd0fR0">THE STONE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p data-content-id="MfMdlEkgq-a1uKaUUALpAADpAeSSkmjRfcVofpiZYMm5RgH8fZWaM9MIilSy8MI87"> As we have pointed out a number of times, the matter of the stone is developed in the New Testament. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108889" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> the Lord Jesus said, “And I also say to you that you are <span class="pg" data-page-id="778" id="778">[778]</span> Peter, and on this rock I will build My church.” Here the Lord refers to Himself as the rock. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108890" data-verses="Matthew 21:42">Matthew 21:42</span> He said, “Have you never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the cornerstone; this was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?” The stone referred to here is the very stone with the seven eyes in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108891" data-verses="Zechariah 3:9">Zechariah 3:9</span>. Peter spoke of the Lord as this stone in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108892" data-verses="Acts 4:11">Acts 4:11</span>, where he said, “This is the stone which was despised by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone.” Peter was telling the religionists that they rejected not only their Redeemer, but also the cornerstone of God’s building. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VhFuMszWUIGfHaNO9f-JJEZi6v-XWJv8VFEUjiuPmuf7Nx9BJILWDFG-eqZg1kGdt">A FURTHER DEVELOPMENT<br/>OF THE SEVEN LAMPS</h2><p data-content-id="i6aa50jw_pYma5-9kQwhXnKKmqwo1wiWJhSG5jnjgpmh3Z1pRGRhjjd60ipXtg60s"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108893" data-verses="Revelation 4:1-2">Revelation 4 and 5</span> we have a further development of the seven lamps. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108894" data-verses="Revelation 4:5">4:5</span>, the seven lamps of the lampstand are seven lamps of fire burning before the throne of God. The seven lamps on the lampstand were for enlightening, but the seven lamps before the throne of God are both for enlightening and for the carrying out of God’s administrative government. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108895" data-verses="Revelation 5:6">Revelation 5:6</span> indicates that the seven lamps burning before the throne are also the seven eyes of the Lamb. Thus, the seven eyes are the seven eyes of the stone, the seven eyes of the Lord, and the seven eyes of the Lamb. These seven eyes combine the stone, the Lord, and the Lamb. This indicates that the Lamb is the stone and that the stone is the Lord. Moreover, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="108896" data-verses="Revelation 5:6">5:6</span> reveals that the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God. On the one hand, there is a line containing six items: the lampstand, the stone, Jehovah, the Lamb, the throne of God, and God. On the other hand, there is another line with three items: the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits. The lampstand signifies shining, and the stone refers to God’s building. Jesus, our Savior, is Jehovah, and the Redeemer is the Lamb. The throne of God indicates God’s government, God’s administration. <span class="pg" data-page-id="779" id="779">[779]</span> </p>
