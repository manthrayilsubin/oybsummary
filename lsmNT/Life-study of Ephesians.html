Although this is an introductory word, we shall cover some crucial and weighty matters. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bx_UdsKHw-vHF3mnF2hC5zE1tzA0LWM1-A9auvEbkRZG4a2E4SntYRIkifhdfEuRY">I. THE SUBJECT—THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="qrCoreirL3MU0e6xc6vji8PdoGrVnz5zIOcWFV4v-HiHK0TVU2I9mwTIzwi4vYBpQ">A. The Body</h2>
<p data-content-id="yso9Pxvovo30rgMfTrxdwDtIWBNApZ3STh7ddBjVVV-UFyNUyESGMFZxFx7YtQwo0"> The subject of the book of Ephesians is the church. Ephesians covers seven aspects of the church, the first of which is the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. In order for a living person to be complete, he must have a body as his expression. The Body of Christ is the fullness of Him who fills all in all. </p>
<p data-content-id="8h6Q8qq7fu5OpgOocEN7CqtPok5nV-y1o55tduWJ4FjR4dq0idwixNOYWvRUriXAE"> The term “fullness” has been misused, misunderstood, and misapplied by today’s Christians. Most Christian teachers confuse fullness with riches. Thus, when Christians speak of the fullness of Christ, they think it means the riches of Christ. (However, although many Christians speak of the fullness of the Holy Spirit or the fullness of God, not many speak of the fullness of Christ.) According to the book of Ephesians, the word fullness does not mean riches; it means expression. The term the “riches of Christ” is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87569" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">3:8</span>, and the term “fullness” is found both in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87570" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">1:23</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87571" data-verses="Ephesians 4:13">4:13</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87572" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Chapter one</span> mentions the fullness of Him who fills all in all, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87573" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span>, the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87574" data-verses="Ephesians 4:13">4:13</span>, the fullness has a stature, and the stature has a measure. Because we have a body, we all have a stature. If we were a head without a body, we would not have a stature. The fullness of Christ is the Body, for <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87575" data-verses="Ephesians 4:13">4:13</span> says that this fullness has a stature with a measure. Thus, we have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUmaxoJx8XNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0"> This fullness is different from the riches. The riches have no stature. But the fullness as the Body has a stature, and with this stature there is a measure. Thus, this strongly proves that the fullness of Christ is not the riches of Christ, but the Body of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="B77vULL4YXIHFFm6havIcY9hVVNWwoUVhHMvf-EO7Y7mN_8U3mz_Sb5pyhxZje63p"> It is important to know why the Body of Christ is called the fullness. This is very significant. The body of a person is simply the fullness of that person, and this fullness is his expression. As I speak, I move with my body. In this way, my being is expressed through my body. Likewise, the church is the Body of Christ, and this Body is the fullness of Him who fills all in all. How profound this is! The whole universe is filled with Christ. As the One who fills all in all, Christ is exceedingly great. Such a great Person needs a great Body. This Body is the church. Hence, the church is the Body of Christ, His fullness. </p>
<p data-content-id="xOItbD1M_SnXcAkcMHRO0aDFtC_nCBIPiZ8yi6s5e1DrTLjV78UWPV1TgR921-jvh"> The riches of Christ may be likened to all the rich foodstuffs produced in America. These riches are not for exhibition; they are for eating. As we eat of the rich American foodstuffs, these riches seem to disappear into us. When these riches are digested and assimilated by us, they become part of us. As a result, they are no longer the riches, but the fullness. Thus, the husky young American men, who assimilate so much of the rich American foodstuffs, are the fullness of America. By means of this illustration we can differentiate between the riches and the fullness. The riches are the food which has not yet been taken into us. But when the food is eaten, digested, and assimilated, it becomes the fullness. The riches of Christ are all the items of what Christ is. When we digest and assimilate into our being the riches of Christ, these riches become part of us, and we become the fullness of Christ. Thus, the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the universally great Person who fills all in all. This is the first item or aspect of what the church is. <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="rzBtTvnnp8EWQ9SXyt4WJFpCNK0wYN18pC-iFM-wWF7biwez5fLvQHeKFo4_b1dI7">B. The New Man</h2><p data-content-id="dvx25G8sssSYMALmWN9v-wwHC3yApwN7G3_YIZuDLoUsHACVRNy6oYa6xgCQFEpxU"> Secondly, the church is the new man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87576" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">2:15</span>). In the universe there is just one new man; hence, the church is <em>the</em> new man. There is a significant difference between the Body and the new man. The Body requires only life, but the new man requires both the life and the person. My body has life, but my being as a man has a person. The church is not only the Body of Christ having the life of Christ; it is also the new man having Christ as the person. No doubt, this new man is corporate, for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87577" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">2:15</span> says that Christ created two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles, into one new man. This means that two collective peoples have been created into the one new man. If we see that the church today is not only the Body, but a man with a person, our realization of the church life will be uplifted. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9LpVFU7TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk">C. The Kingdom</h2><p data-content-id="KinSpiWncXMNo5T64K5GnF2jivJMOAmz0SWiBllAApDxAJJy3NRnyUU_zHhMXOBI9"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87578" data-verses="Ephesians 2:19">2:19</span> we see that the church is the kingdom of God. This verse says, “So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow-citizens of the saints.” The term fellow-citizens indicates a kingdom, for being a fellow-citizen refers to being one with certain civil rights, and civil rights are always related to a nation or kingdom. Thus, this verse reveals that the church is the kingdom of God and that we are the citizens of this kingdom possessing certain civil rights. As we enjoy these rights, we must also share the responsibilities. Hence, the church is the kingdom of God with both rights and responsibilities. If we want the rights, we must also bear the responsibilities. Sometimes, however, we may want to enjoy the rights without bearing the responsibilities. But we must participate in both, sharing the rights and bearing the responsibilities. This is the church as the kingdom of God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="lwsB7fTo0YBNqEyc92s8YZtZbuR5l2669bSShh3cXlYnPCMXGJH6EofNa-wN0fGTI">D. The Household of God</h2><p data-content-id="ORuveXsLSL_KAUQRmmsRwUAvnxfJksZhadewDeZFVr0RNBcjRKpEUgJ7ZofkxfD26"> Fourthly, the church is the household of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87579" data-verses="Ephesians 2:19">2:19</span>). The household is not a matter of civil rights, but a matter of life and enjoyment. At home you do not speak much about <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> rights, for there you have the father’s life and the enjoyment of his life. Thus, the church as the household or family of God refers to life and enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="4hu3V9NSxOD4qIDQx-aI8nyfOXQAdHAukquOkznsExY9T1eCWD6YHuZmIvOhld_9j"> Many saints like the family-type church life, but not the kingdom church life. This means that they always want to have a good time, a marvelous enjoyment. But we cannot always stay home; we need to spend several hours a day away from home to earn a living. We should have not only the enjoyment of the family, but also the responsibility of the kingdom. The church cannot always be a family; it must also be the kingdom of God. Nevertheless, I am happy that in the church as the family of God we have life and enjoyment. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="od6p5sc1GDqOFwWB01GI4UNxBvyh4TvvTOTFDcnJar4LT8Qnqe8UcaKDTX05Qn6K7">E. The Dwelling Place of God</h2><p data-content-id="3GEuFAt2o9byg8MZDzK996mT9fH7FXg_LkbTuP-LW2tuU3xrWTByUo7lMUOiCI2ZU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87580" data-verses="Ephesians 2:21-22">2:21 and 22</span> we see that the church is also the dwelling place of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87581" data-verses="Ephesians 2:21">Verse 21</span> says that all the building is growing into a holy temple in the Lord. This refers to the universal building. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87582" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">Verse 22</span> says that the saints in Ephesus are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit. This is the local building. Universally the church is the temple in the Lord, and locally the church is the dwelling place of God in our spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="GJHsP88GHseo8rpjYyem_lGLTqQ544KrNMLYo1DtwblC8XXjSuatQl8WDTK_MeK3O">F. The Bride, the Wife, of Christ</h2><p data-content-id="cUZm3R2OO3-xg87ohmxD-0kNZbXX-m8pa3KWJwuNiJOAyh8b5NcNgFoM_6ZG01679"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87583" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">chapter five</span> we see the church as the bride, the wife, of Christ. A bride is for the satisfaction of the husband. In speaking of when Adam was alone, the Bible says, “It is not good that the man should be alone” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87584" data-verses="Genesis 2:18">Gen. 2:18</span>). This word indicates that when Adam was alone, he had no happiness or satisfaction; Adam needed a wife. When Adam was given a wife, he had rest and satisfaction. Therefore, according to the Bible, the bride, the wife, is for rest and satisfaction. How could we be satisfied without rest? Being fully satisfied implies enjoying a full rest. A man’s wedding day is a day of satisfaction and rest. Because Christ loves the church, the church is His rest and satisfaction. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y7KPbnfhmVACkNVkC3njcSp97kiJBRrpc5RUdAorxwk76X6_8r4-6ikKrq_X9AheN"> Christ’s love for the church is different from His love for sinners. Christians often speak about Christ loving sinners, <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> but very few talk about Christ loving His wife. We used to be sinners, but today we are the wife of Christ. Whether we are male or female, we are His wife. The church is a wife for the satisfaction of Christ. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="xOItbD1M_SnXcAkcMHRO0aDFuC_uJBIPiZ8yi6s5e1DrTLjV78UWPV1TgR921-jvh">THREE ASPECTS OF WELL-SPEAKING</h1><p data-content-id="rzBtTvnnp8EWQ9SXyt4WJFpCOK0lQN18pC-iFM-wWF7biwez5fLvQHeKFo4_b1dI7"> In this message we shall consider three aspects of well-speaking concerning God. Such a subject may be considered very unusual. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87612" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span> says, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.” The words “blessed” and “blessing” have the same root in Greek. The Greek word for blessed means well spoken of, praised with adoration; and the Greek word for blessing means good speech, good utterance, fine speaking, fine speech, implying bounty and benefit. Used with respect to God, this blessing is a laudation, a genuine praise, even a praise to God on the highest level. The Greek word with the basic meaning of well-speaking is the word used by the Apostle Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87613" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">1:3</span> for the praise of God. Paul uses this word to speak well concerning God, to utter fine praise, even beautiful praise, to Him. He uses it to praise, extol, and exalt God. Thus, to praise God means to speak well concerning God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dvx25G8sssSYMALmWN9v-wwHB3yRgwN7G3_YIZuDLoUsHACVRNy6oYa6xgCQFEpxU">I. BLESSED BE THE GOD AND FATHER<br/>OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9LqVFJ1TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> In this high praise of God, Paul did not say, “Blessed be God whose mercy endureth forever.” Many of the young people like to sing the Psalms, especially the Psalm that says, “His mercy endureth forever.” Such a praise to God is not nearly as high as that uttered by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87614" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">1:3</span>. Although we find it difficult to understand such a verse as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87615" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">1:3</span>, we can easily understand what it means for God’s mercy to endure forever because this fits in with our natural concept. <span class="pg" data-page-id="16" id="16">[16]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="KinSpiWncXMNo5T64K5GnF2jhvJVBAmz0SWiBllAApDxAJJy3NRnyUU_zHhMXOBI9"> In Christianity today there are two main sources of mixture. The first is the mixture created by the Catholic Church, which has blended the New Testament economy with the Old Testament rituals. The second mixture is that made by the Pentecostal movement. The Pentecostals bring Christians back to the Old Testament praises in the Psalms. I do not, of course, condemn the Psalms, but I condemn the way of singing them that is according to the natural concept. For example, not one verse in the New Testament says that God’s mercy endures forever. Nevertheless, the Pentecostals continue to sing the Psalms according to the natural concept. I have never heard Pentecostals singing on the book of Ephesians, for to those in Pentecostalism this book is closed. In their praises there is no sense of the incarnation, no indication that God has become one with man. In order to praise God for His mercy which endures forever, there is no need of revelation. Anyone who cares for God knows that His mercy endures forever. However, it takes revelation to praise God according to Paul’s utterance in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87616" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">1:3</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="lwsB7fTo0YBNqEyc92s8YZtZYuRcp2669bSShh3cXlYnPCMXGJH6EofNa-wN0fGTI"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87617" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">1:3</span> Paul says, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Since Jesus Christ is God, why does Paul speak of the God of Jesus Christ? How can God be His God? Furthermore, Paul mentions the Father of Jesus Christ. How can God have a Father? God is the God of our Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of Man, and God is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God. According to His humanity, God is His God; and according to His divinity, God is His Father. </p>
<p data-content-id="ORuveXsLSL_KAUQRmmsRwUAvkxfopsZhadewDeZFVr0RNBcjRKpEUgJ7ZofkxfD26"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87618" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">verse 3</span> Paul also speaks of our Lord Jesus Christ. Since the Lord Jesus Christ is ours, whatever God is to Him is also ours. Our Lord refers to the lordship of our Savior (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87619" data-verses="Acts 2:36">Acts 2:36</span>), Jesus to the man as our Savior (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87620" data-verses="1Timothy 2:5">1 Tim. 2:5</span>), and Christ to God’s anointed One (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87621" data-verses="John 20:31">John 20:31</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5eu-ryI9O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6"> It is absolutely correct to say that God is full of mercy and that His mercy endures forever. This is to speak well and beautifully concerning God. However, such speaking is according to the natural concept. Today we are in the heavenlies, in eternity, in God’s heart, and in God’s purpose. <span class="pg" data-page-id="17" id="17">[17]</span> Thus, we should speak well of God, not according to our natural concept, but according to His revelation concerning Himself. The praise that speaks well of God’s mercy and greatness is elementary, whereas the praise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87622" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">1:3</span> is the praise in graduate school. In the meetings we need more of the praises that are on a higher level. </p>
<p data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6oxxPdlkLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9"> The praise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87623" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">1:3</span> is deep and profound, encompassing the entire New Testament economy. Here we have not only creation, indicated by the title “God,” but also incarnation, indicated by the title “the God of our Lord Jesus Christ.” The first revelation of God in the Bible is in creation, for the Bible opens with the words, “In the beginning God created....” Following creation is the incarnation. One day God the Creator became incarnated as a man. The Word that was with God and was God became flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87624" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87625" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). When God Himself became a man, the God who created all things became His God. This is incarnation, not merely the greatness or mercy of God. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87626" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span> the God of our Lord Jesus Christ refers to incarnation. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZF7iQ7T0lQJP8gtIC7nMKHRynLd4EgK5Boj8tqPtmmD8KvxV6FuuLU1d_HGholgwP"> God not only created, but one day He became incarnated. In the incarnation He is the Father to impart His life to all His sons. The God of our Lord Jesus Christ indicates that the Lord Jesus was a man. If He were only God, God could never be His God. In order for God to be His God, He had to be a man. The God whom the Jews worship is only the God of creation, not the God of incarnation. We today worship not only the God of creation, but also the God of incarnation and the Father of the impartation of life. The highest praise to God says that our God the Creator became a man and that our God is also the life-imparting Father. In incarnation, the God of creation became the very God of Jesus. At the same time, God is the Father of Christ as the Son of God. In Christ’s humanity, God is His God; but in His divinity, God is His Father. Before His crucifixion and resurrection, He was the only begotten Son of God, but after His resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God to produce the many sons of God. Therefore, the inspired praise of God spoken by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87627" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">1:3</span> implies creation, incarnation, and impartation of life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="18" id="18">[18]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OIhZSbw2SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH"> But to praise God that His mercy endures forever does not imply anything of incarnation or the impartation of life. It simply says that God is very merciful. Such praise has nothing to do with God becoming a man or with the impartation of His life. It is not related at all to the Father’s imparting His life into His creatures to make them the sons of God. For this reason, I say that the high praise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87628" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">1:3</span>, unlike the praise of God for His enduring mercy, is on the level of graduate school. </p>
<p data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2etQaK13ogmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg"> Because Paul’s well-speaking in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87629" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">1:3</span> is difficult to understand, he prayed elsewhere in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87630" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span> for a spirit of wisdom and revelation. We certainly need such a spirit today. We need revelation to see, and we need wisdom to understand, realize, and comprehend. But instead of revelation and wisdom, many of us have only our natural concept. Hence, we praise God that His mercy endures forever. Instead of such elementary praise, we need to praise God according to the well-speaking in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87631" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">1:3</span>. We need to bless the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praising Him for creation, incarnation, and the impartation of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiEvvr6ji8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND"> Whatever God is to Christ is transmitted to us. God is His, and He is ours. God is His God and Father, and He is our Lord. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87632" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22">1:22</span> God gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church. The little word “to” implies a transmission, indicating that whatever Christ has attained and obtained is transmitted to the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="P5LAppNM9anuOY8qKFZGxca72XKRBW6wXX1IPiDZBj9REBKOwCbu8774faHM2uakW"> The title “Our Lord Jesus Christ” is rich in meaning. “Lord” signifies Christ’s lordship, “Jesus” signifies His humanity to be our Redeemer and Savior, and “Christ” signifies that He is God’s anointed One. This is a further indication that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87633" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">1:3</span> is the top praise, the highest well-speaking of God. We all need to speak well concerning God in this way: in the way of creation, incarnation, impartation of life, and transmission, with redemption, the Redeemer, the Savior, and the anointed One to accomplish God’s eternal purpose. </p>

THAT WE SHOULD BE HOLY</h2><p data-content-id="GJHsP88GHseo8rpjYyem_lGLRqQ164KrNMLYo1DtwblC8XXjSuatQl8WDTK_MeK3O"> God chose us that we should be holy. The words “holy” and “holiness” have been spoiled by today’s Christian teachings. Your understanding of holiness is probably influenced by these teachings. In the Bible the word “holy” should not be understood according to our natural concept. Many think that holiness is sinlessness. According to this concept, someone is holy if he does not sin. This thought is absolutely mistaken. Holiness is neither sinlessness nor perfection. Holy not only means sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything that is common. Only God is different, distinct, from all things. Hence, He is holy; holiness is His nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="cUZm3R2OO3-xg87ohmxD-0kNbbXb4m8pa3KWJwuNiJOAyh8b5NcNgFoM_6ZG01679"> The way God makes us holy is to impart Himself, the Holy One, into us so that our whole being may be permeated and saturated with His holy nature. For us, God’s chosen ones, to be holy is to partake of His divine nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87644" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Pet. 1:4</span>) and to have our whole being permeated with God Himself. This is different from mere sinless perfection or sinless purity. This makes our being holy, like God Himself in His nature and in His character. </p>

It also means to be different, distinct, from all that is not God. Thus, we should not be common, but different. In the universe God alone is holy. He is different from everything else and is distinct. Therefore, to be holy means to be one with God. To be sinless or perfect is not the same as <span class="pg" data-page-id="25" id="25">[25]</span> being holy. To be holy we need to be one with God because only God is holy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87645" data-verses="Leviticus 11:44">Lev. 11:44</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87646" data-verses="1Samuel 2:2">1 Sam. 2:2</span>). </p>

Wherever God Is Being Holy</h2><p data-content-id="S26jTFFVZnj955_hMlMnIhYszMx0tdPkCD61VuHGKt4L3wCMJyIZ3UBt_LzbPLTVG"> The word “holy” is not found in the book of Genesis. The first time this word is used is in Exodus. In a sense, man in Genesis was still not brought into God. It was in the book of Exodus, not in the book of Genesis, that God began to have a dwelling place on earth, and to bring man into the Holy of Holies. No matter how high were the spiritual experiences of those in Genesis, there was not on earth the Holy of Holies for man to enter. But in Exodus something extraordinary took place: on earth among men there was a place called the Holy of Holies, and God was there. Men could go to that place and meet God. There in the Holy of Holies, God spoke and administrated. Because such a place is not to be found in Genesis, the word “holy” is not used in that book. When God came in to charge His people to build the tabernacle with the Holy of Holies, the word “holy” began to be used. </p>
<p data-content-id="gBi8-OiEa7te_n7JZc2wVW64nMFHyZhCfpqqsc2x3FtvD6W9167GIkeZns_JUH8SK"> The first mention of this word is in the calling of Moses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87647" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span>. As Moses was shepherding the flock, he saw a bush burning in the wilderness. When he turned aside to see why the bush was not consumed, God spoke to him out of the bush, saying, “Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87648" data-verses="Exodus 3:5">Exo. 3:5</span>). This indicates that wherever God is, that place is holy. Remember, only God is holy. If you have nothing to do with God, then you are not holy, no matter how sinless or perfect you may be. You may be sinless and altogether perfect, but if you are not related to God, you are not holy. But once you are related to God, you immediately become holy. </p>

This is the reason that the term “Holy Spirit” is not used in the Old Testament. (The occurrences of this term in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87657" data-verses="Psalms 51:11">Psalm 51:11</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87658" data-verses="Isaiah 63:10-11">Isaiah 63:10 and 11</span> should be rendered “the spirit of holiness.”) This term was first used when the Lord Jesus was about to be conceived in Mary (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87659" data-verses="Luke 1:35">Luke 1:35</span>). This signifies that holiness brings God to man and man to God. To go further, it also means to bring God into man and man into God. When God gets into us, we are holy. When we get into God, we are more holy. But when we are mingled with God, we are most holy. Thus, we become holy by having God in us, we become more holy by being in God, and we become the holiest by being mingled, soaked, and saturated with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8rWCawAQiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> The book of Ephesians calls the believers saints (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87660" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">1:1</span>). Everyone who has believed in the Lord Jesus is a saint. But some saints are holy, some are holier, and some are the holiest. There is no doubt that we all are holy, but it is open to question whether or not we are holier or the holiest. For example, during your time with the Lord in the morning, you may be under the process of being soaked and saturated with Him. But then your wife may say something to offend you and you lose your temper. Thus, after breakfast you go back to your room and pray, “O Lord, forgive me. I was being saturated with You, but one word from my wife caused me to be apart from You. Lord, bring me back to the soaking. Lord, how I praise You for the cleansing blood!” The purpose of this illustration is to point out that when we are in touch with God, we are holy, for then we are under His saturation. But when we are away from God, we are not holy. I repeat, to be holy is not to be perfect or sinless; it is to be one with God. When we are saturated and soaked with God, we shall be the holiest. </p>
<p data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxi6xsjrZAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy"> We have seen that holiness is God Himself. The first time the word “holy” was used was when God began to have a <span class="pg" data-page-id="27" id="27">[27]</span> people on earth among whom He might dwell and who might come into His presence in the Holy of Holies. From that time onward, this word is used again and again in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. So many things found in these books are called holy because in these books God has come among man and man has been brought to God; thus everything related to the tabernacle and the priesthood was holy. Everything related to God’s ordination in the Old Testament was holy because it involved the meeting together of God and man. </p>

They are two aspects of one thing. God’s choosing goes with His predestinating, and His predestinating is one with His choosing. It is very difficult to say which comes first. </p>

The goal of God’s predestination is sonship. We were predestinated to be sons of God even before we were created. Hence, as God’s creatures, we need to be regenerated by Him so that we may participate in His life to be His sons. Sonship implies not only the life, but also <span class="pg" data-page-id="36" id="36">[36]</span> the position of the son. God’s marked-out ones have the life to be His sons and the position to inherit Him. </p>

God firstly selected us and then marked us out beforehand, that is, before the foundation of the world, unto a certain destiny. </p>

This reveals that God has a will in which is His good pleasure. God predestinated us to be His sons according to this pleasure, according to the desire of His heart. The book of Ephesians speaks not from the standpoint of man’s sinful condition, as does the book of Romans, but from the standpoint of the good pleasure of God’s heart. Hence, it is deeper and higher. </p>

UNTO SONSHIP</h2><p data-content-id="XN29daXoEaiDc-NwR9H8WYC7NCQLaqlHCNZd9RwShWBkL98XRz-1aU8fWCfEcI9un"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87688" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4">verse 4</span> we see that God has chosen us to be holy. However, to be holy is the procedure, not the goal. The goal is sonship. We have been predestinated unto sonship. In other <span class="pg" data-page-id="37" id="37">[37]</span> words, God has chosen us to be holy so that we might be His sons. Thus, to be holy is the process, the procedure, whereas to be sons of God is the goal. God does not merely want a group of holy people; He desires many sons. It may seem to us that it is adequate for God to choose us to be holy. We may be fully satisfied with this. Nevertheless, God has chosen us to be holy for a purpose, and this purpose is that we might be the sons of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="kW37bRWd4n3ChsU9j6t193oGbSZGaNT7Km646Yo-l1oZoLWUehit8wxR0xamoxSLO"> Let us take baking a cake as an example. When a sister bakes a cake, she firstly prepares the dough by mixing various ingredients together with flour. As the ingredients are mixed in with the dough, we may say that the dough is a picture of sanctification. First the dough is separated; then it is sanctified through having various ingredients added to it. After the sister mixes the dough, she shapes it into a certain form. Likewise, God first separates us, and then puts Himself, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, into us. Then follows the process of mixing. To say that God mixes us means that He disturbs us. We may like to have a tranquil church life, but often God intervenes to turn things upside down. Nevertheless, this is the normal Christian church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jf0PJ3Yzh-Zban-Z3PEii4PLmX0Kz6DqyCleWzpwECAyBCCrwndk4EBUpamTJ1Vjs"> To be holy is to be mingled with God. God sanctifies us by putting Himself into us and then mingling us with His nature. This is a matter of nature, of having our nature transformed with His. We were born human, natural, but God wants us to be divine. The only way this can take place is through having the divine nature put into our being and mingled with it. In this way, God makes us holy. Thus, sanctification is a procedure to transform our nature. This, however, is not the goal. The goal is related to being formed or shaped. This is the reason that along with God’s choosing us to be holy, there is the need of His predestinating us to be sons. To be holy is a matter of nature, but to be sons is a matter of being formed. God’s sons are people conformed to a particular form or shape. </p>
<p data-content-id="ziHhFbwj9qduVCwT62zA_ZS2iUWJJVUD31ttVpb1c14zDjDyuEyTtvwQz3ufe66GN"> The golden lampstand in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87689" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1</span> illustrates this. In nature, the lampstand is golden, but in form it is a lampstand. In order for a golden lampstand to be produced, <span class="pg" data-page-id="38" id="38">[38]</span> the material must first be pure gold. This refers to the procedure. But the goal of this procedure is the producing of the lampstand with a definite form. In like manner, to be made holy is the procedure for us to become sons of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="a-sefdyyFRnPSiT6ZZ18VpqljG9FSTLq-KbZep_8kFXpjCLum-lwALY397Cqj_hpR"> When I saw that holiness was for sonship, I said to myself, “How could you ever have been satisfied with holiness as an end in itself? You can only be satisfied with being a son of God.” Thus, we are not only holy, but also the sons of God. We have not only God’s holy nature, but also the Person of His Son. Therefore, we are not merely holy lumps, but also sons of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="bx_UdsKHw-vHF3mnF2hC5zE1ozApCWM1-A9auvEbkRZG4a2E4SntYRIkifhdfEuRY"> All Christians know that the genuine believers in Christ are the church. But the church is not merely a group of saved ones. The church is a collective people who have been made holy in nature to be the sons of God. This collective people must be sanctified, saturated, and mingled with God’s nature. Then they will be the sons of God. Such a people is the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="qrCoreirL3MU0e6xc6vji8PdtGrEpz5zIOcWFV4v-HiHK0TVU2I9mwTIzwi4vYBpQ"> The situation of today’s Christianity is far removed from this. In Christianity we see groups of people who are saved, but who are still common and worldly, not having any holiness whatever. Furthermore, they do not live like sons of God. Rather, many of them live like sons of sinners. Although so many believe in the Lord Jesus, have been washed in the blood, and have been regenerated by the Spirit, they are still worldly and common, with no mark of holiness in their living. They are absolutely the same as their neighbors, friends, and relatives. Nevertheless, they talk about being the church. What a shame to God, and what a shame to the church! The church is constituted as a collective people who have been separated unto God and who are saturated with the nature of God and fully sanctified to live like sons of God. The church certainly should not be a group of worldly Christians living like the sons of sinners. It is a shame to say that such a group is the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="yso9Pxvovo30rgMfTrxdwDtITBNVmZ3STh7ddBjVVV-UFyNUyESGMFZxFx7YtQwo0"> If we claim to be the church, we must ask whether we are a separated and sanctified people. Are we separated unto God and saturated with God? Are we sanctified both <span class="pg" data-page-id="39" id="39">[39]</span> positionally and dispositionally with God’s nature to live like the sons of God? Oh, may our eyes be opened to see what the church is! The church is not a group of Christians who are zealous, yet who are common and worldly without any separation or saturation. The church is constituted with those who have been sanctified by God to live like sons of God. </p>

This may appear to be a very simple subject, but actually it is very difficult. We may think that we are familiar with the words praise, glory, and grace, but if we are honest, we shall admit that we do not adequately know what they mean. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4e2WoOKDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87702" data-verses="Ephesians 1:6">Ephesians 1:6</span> says, “To the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved.” This verse does not stand by itself. Rather, it is the issue of predestination unto sonship mentioned in the preceding verse. This means that the praise of the glory of God’s grace is the result, the issue, of the sonship. Therefore, in order to understand the praise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87703" data-verses="Ephesians 1:6">verse 6</span>, we must know the sonship in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87704" data-verses="Ephesians 1:5">verse 5</span>. If we do not know the content of the sonship, we may merely understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87705" data-verses="Ephesians 1:6">verse 6</span> in a natural way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAzuoTlEtH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9">I. GOD’S GRACE BEING WHAT HE IS<br/>TO US FOR OUR ENJOYMENT</h2><p data-content-id="wZZd7ZXC7lqDMlD_3-HJuDfTQ2iwDM5RxitkD5PpVOrwkpldqqeIgnRv2-Kvi2tyM"> What is God’s grace? It is very difficult to define grace. I have been puzzled by this for many years, and even today I am still studying it. According to the New Testament, grace is what God is to us for our enjoyment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87706" data-verses="John 1:16-17">John 1:16-17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87707" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:9">2 Cor. 12:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87708" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:10">1 Cor. 15:10</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87709" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span> says that the law was given through Moses, but that grace and reality came through Jesus Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87710" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:10">1 Corinthians 15:10</span> Paul says that he labored more than the other apostles, yet not he, but the grace of God which was with him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87711" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> is parallel to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87712" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:10">1 Corinthians 15:10</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87713" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> says, “Not I, but Christ,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87714" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:10">1 Corinthians 15:10</span> says, “Not I, but the grace of God.” This indicates that grace is Christ Himself. Other <span class="pg" data-page-id="48" id="48">[48]</span> portions of the New Testament emphasize grace. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87715" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Corinthians 13:14</span> says, “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.” Furthermore, Paul opens all his Epistles with a reference to grace; he also ends them all with a word about grace. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87716" data-verses="Galatians 6:18">Galatians 6:18</span> says, “Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87717" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">Second Timothy 4:22</span> says, “The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.” In this verse Christ and grace are parallel. For the Lord Jesus Christ to be with our spirit is equal to grace being with our spirit. This indicates that grace is virtually equal to Christ. When we have Christ, we have grace. When Christ came, grace came. This is the reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87718" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span> says that grace came through Jesus Christ, indicating that grace is somewhat like a person. It is personified. This personification of grace is God Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5eu5ryt3O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6"> Although this may sound strange to some ears, it is nevertheless a fact. If you get into the spirit of the New Testament concerning grace, you will realize that grace is somewhat personified. When Paul said, “Not I, but the grace of God which was with me,” grace was a living person to him. In Paul, a Person became the very grace to labor. Therefore, grace is actually God Himself; it is what God is to us for our enjoyment. When God is enjoyed by us, that is grace. Grace is the very God in His Son Jesus Christ to be our portion so that we may enjoy all that He is. </p>
<p data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6ox2PdEvLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9"> God is love. If we do not enjoy Him as love, we do not have grace. But if we enjoy God as love, we have grace. Again I say, grace is what God is to us as our portion for our enjoyment. We should sing not only of God’s mercy enduring forever, but also of God’s grace. We need to compose some songs about God being grace to us, songs to express what God is for our enjoyment. If we praise God only for His mercy, we remain on an elementary level. We need to go on from God’s mercy to God’s grace. Grace issues from mercy, just as high school is the continuation of elementary school. After elementary school, we need to go on to high school. We need to go on and not remain in elementary school so long. <span class="pg" data-page-id="49" id="49">[49]</span> Many of today’s Christians, however, remain in the elementary grades, even though they may have been Christians for many years. Let us go on to the higher grades and praise God for His grace. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="S26jTFFVZnj955_hMlMnIhYs1Mx0ldPkCD61VuHGKt4L3wCMJyIZ3UBt_LzbPLTVG">II. THE GLORY OF GOD’S GRACE<br/>BEING GOD EXPRESSED IN HIS GRACE</h2><p data-content-id="gBi8-OiEa7te_n7JZc2wVW64hMFH6ZhCfpqqsc2x3FtvD6W9167GIkeZns_JUH8SK"> Now we need to consider what the glory of God’s grace is. Perhaps you have read the book of Ephesians many times without noticing the phrase “the glory of His grace.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87719" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span> says that Christ, the Son of God, is the effulgence of God’s glory. God has a glory, and the effulgence, the shining out, of this glory is His Son. If you carefully study the subject of glory in the Bible, you will find that glory is God expressed. Whenever God is manifested, that is glory. We may use electricity as an illustration. Electricity is hidden, but when it is expressed as light, that light is the glory of electricity. Likewise, when God is hidden, we cannot see His glory. But when He is expressed, His glory is made visible. Hence, glory is God expressed. As soon as the tabernacle was erected, it was filled with the glory of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87720" data-verses="Exodus 40:34">Exo. 40:34</span>). That glory was the expression of God. In the same principle, the Son of God came as the effulgence of the glory of God, which means that He is the expression of God. No man has ever seen God, but we have seen the glory of the only begotten Son. </p>
<p data-content-id="e7TeZuy6ip5trkTcKOr38frV9Db6iup2tVAiVqlMGn0mLpxnTuxCJvbcyNlyALCaC"> The glory of God’s grace is that His grace, which is Himself as our enjoyment, expresses Him. God is expressed in His grace, and His predestination is for the praise of this expression. As we receive grace and enjoy God, we have the sense of glory, although we may not have the words to express this sense. Sometimes after an excellent meeting we are full of grace and say, “That was glorious!” This is God expressed in His grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="5tbeNC7n4bELsmeplIXgNzTmmgwibKoF26Q5SKhmn5Z95j36NkbT_ysCBWMthTXfH"> When we realize that we have been chosen to be holy and predestinated to sonship; that we have the Spirit of the Son, the life of the Son, and the position of the Son; and that we shall be conformed to the image of the Son, have the <span class="pg" data-page-id="50" id="50">[50]</span> completion of sonship, the redemption of our body, and inherit the full sonship, we shall say, “What a glory!” We need to consider six items prayerfully: the Spirit of the Son, the life of the Son, the position of the Son, the image of the Son, the completion of sonship, and the inheritance of sonship. If you do this, you will be in glory and praise God for the sonship. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyFzx0i1ZOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi">III. THE PRAISE OF THE GLORY<br/>OF GOD’S GRACE BEING THE HIGH PRAISE<br/>OF GOD EXPRESSED IN HIS GRACE</h2><p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyT7ItHUUr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> We have seen that grace is God Himself as our enjoyment, that glory is God manifested, and that the glory of God’s grace is God expressed in our enjoyment of Him. Now we must come to the most difficult aspect of this message: the meaning of praise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87721" data-verses="Ephesians 1:6">verse 6</span>. What is the <em>praise</em> of the glory of God’s grace? Have you ever praised God for the sonship? We, the sons of God, do not praise God very much. Usually we simply thank Him. When we say, “Praise the Lord,” we often mean, “Thank the Lord.” To thank God means that we have received a certain benefit and thank God for it. But when we praise God, we praise Him primarily for what He is or what He does, no matter whether or not we have received any benefits from Him. In praising God you need to forget yourself and get outside of yourself. When you are truly praising God, it seems that you do not exist. You see only God, what He is, and what He does. Therefore, you praise Him and speak well concerning Him. To use an extreme illustration, could you praise God if He sent you to hell? If you truly knew God, you would be able to say, “O God, even if You send me to hell, I will still praise You because You are God.” Oh, how we need to learn to praise Him! </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiEvrr6qt8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND">REDEMPTION IN THE SON</h1><p data-content-id="P5LAppNM9anuOY8qKFZGxca7yXKENW6wXX1IPiDZBj9REBKOwCbu8774faHM2uakW"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87731" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3-14">1:3-14</span> there are three sections: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87732" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3-6">verses 3 through 6</span>, the Father’s selection and predestination, speaking forth God’s eternal purpose; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87733" data-verses="Ephesians 1:7-12">verses 7 through 12</span>, the Son’s redemption, speaking forth the accomplishment of God’s eternal purpose; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87734" data-verses="Ephesians 1:14-15">verses 13 and 14</span>, the Spirit’s sealing and pledging, speaking forth the application of God’s accomplished purpose. First we have the Father’s eternal purpose, then the Son’s accomplishment of the Father’s purpose, and finally the Spirit’s application of what the Son has accomplished according to the Father’s purpose. By this we see that the Triune God is expressed in His blessings. Through the Father’s purpose, the Son’s accomplishment, and the Spirit’s application we become the church. In the previous messages we have covered the Father’s selection and predestination. In this message we shall consider the Son’s redemption, that is, redemption in the Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87735" data-verses="Ephesians 1:7">1:7</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="-xjGehvejCQlzalTuo32KU2bUU9yfuPgtsH4FEYaUB1lCP61PJ3xPUdWBlbNL_kSt"> We have seen that the book of Ephesians does not speak from our condition, from the earth, or from time, but speaks from God’s eternal purpose, from the heavenlies, and from eternity. Since this is the case, you may wonder why redemption is mentioned here. It is because we, God’s chosen ones, became fallen. According to God’s eternal purpose, we were chosen, but after creation we became fallen. Hence, there is the need of redemption. By redeeming us, the Son accomplished the Father’s purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="pUgU6yw7JGTUYrgFoe8JTp3adQJaYv7TrTsP0dxOoJBaWmsdb5vA9y_VoOGAtYpSI"> Although <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87736" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> speaks of redemption, it does not record our pitiful situation. This is fully unveiled in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87737" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">chapter two</span>. When we come to that chapter, we shall see how pitiful our situation was and how much we were in need of God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="56" id="56">[56]</span> mercy. Although <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87738" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> is altogether glorious, it nevertheless refers to our need for redemption due to the fall. </p>
<p data-content-id="vNGdZHHY14iAb_v6HwIE3H6aIAnIWeE22cQi8F0_YUxRFUJ9ktsfg-XG_7irJOOpq"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87739" data-verses="Ephesians 1:7">Ephesians 1:7</span> says, “In Whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87740" data-verses="Ephesians 1:7">Verse 7</span> is the continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87741" data-verses="Ephesians 1:6">verse 6</span>. As we saw in the last message, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87742" data-verses="Ephesians 1:6">verse 6</span> reveals that we have become the object of God’s favor, for we have been graced in the Beloved. The phrase “in Whom” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87743" data-verses="Ephesians 1:7">verse 7</span> refers to “the Beloved” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87744" data-verses="Ephesians 1:6">verse 6</span>. This means that we have been redeemed in the Beloved, in the One in whom God delights. Thus, in the eyes of God, redemption is not a pitiful matter; it is a thing to be delighted in. Although it is accurate to say that we are redeemed in Christ, it is not as delightful as saying that we are redeemed in the Beloved. The words “in the Beloved” mean in God’s delight. In God’s delight, the Beloved, we have redemption. This is a further indication that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87745" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> there is no thought of our pitiful condition; rather, this chapter is filled with delight. We have been redeemed through the blood of God’s Beloved shed on the cross for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="WMnpS5Obzk_YTS3q3GOFH1SJqAwMErnZYpJ1P_jLUOjwyCSv5ZbC6HMtrIdmASj5I"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87746" data-verses="Ephesians 1:7">verse 7</span>, this redemption is the forgiveness of offenses, not the forgiveness of sins. There is a difference between offenses and sins. Because the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87747" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> is so sweet, it does not speak of sins, but of offenses. In the eyes of the Father, His chosen ones have committed some offenses which need to be forgiven. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87748" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Chapter two</span>, on the contrary, speaks of wrath and sins. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87749" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> God the Father takes care of our offenses. However, even these offenses made redemption necessary, and the blood of the beloved Son of God was shed on the cross for our forgiveness. Apart from the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87750" data-verses="Hebrews 9:22">Heb. 9:22</span>). Hence, there was the need of the blood. This forgiveness was according to the riches of God’s grace, which He caused to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87751" data-verses="Ephesians 1:8">v. 8</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2dq7QF0hlVfHljch6uMOWbrA38v1gD7PM_en5LHupWopm5T9JM8tlnCWOoNUSQNy6">I.

But after creation we became fallen. Hence, we need <span class="pg" data-page-id="57" id="57">[57]</span> redemption, which God has accomplished for us in Christ through His blood. This is another item of God’s blessing bestowed upon us. The first blessing is selection to be holy, the second is predestination unto sonship, and the third is redemption in the Son. </p>

Our Father who delights in us is righteous and cannot tolerate unrighteousness, wrongdoings, or offenses. Such things insult His righteousness. Therefore, His righteousness makes the accomplishment of redemption necessary. Redemption fulfills God’s righteous requirements and pleases God. God is not only a God of love; He is also righteous, and anything unrighteous displeases Him. Everything related to Him must satisfy the requirements of His righteousness. This is the reason that, in order to please God, the beloved Son had to go to the cross to accomplish full redemption for God’s chosen ones. </p>

Because the Son’s death in the flesh on the cross has fulfilled God’s righteous requirement, His blood becomes the very instrument for our redemption. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bx_UdsKHw-vHF3mnF2hC5zE1qzAlEWM1-A9auvEbkRZG4a2E4SntYRIkifhdfEuRY">IV. REDEMPTION THROUGH HIS BLOOD<br/>BEING THE FORGIVENESS OF OUR OFFENSES</h2><p data-content-id="qrCoreirL3MU0e6xc6vji8PdvGrIrz5zIOcWFV4v-HiHK0TVU2I9mwTIzwi4vYBpQ"> The Son’s redemption through His blood is the forgiveness of our offenses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87754" data-verses="Matthew 26:28">Matt. 26:28</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87755" data-verses="Hebrews 9:22">Heb. 9:22</span>). Redemption is what Christ has accomplished for our offenses; forgiveness is what Christ accomplished applied to our offenses. Redemption was accomplished on the cross, whereas forgiveness is applied the moment we believe in Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="58" id="58">[58]</span> Redemption and forgiveness are actually two ends of one thing. We have seen that the forgiveness of offenses is the redemption accomplished through the blood of Christ. However, two terms are used because this one thing has two ends: the end of the accomplishment on the cross and the end of the application to us at the time we believed. Although redemption was accomplished on the cross when Christ shed His blood, it was not applied to us at that time. The application did not take place until we believed in Christ and made confession to the righteous God. At that very moment, the Spirit of God applied to us the redemption Christ had accomplished on the cross. Hence, redemption is the accomplishment, and forgiveness is the application. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yso9Pxvovo30rgMfTrxdwDtIRBNZkZ3STh7ddBjVVV-UFyNUyESGMFZxFx7YtQwo0">V. ACCORDING TO THE RICHES OF HIS GRACE</h2><p data-content-id="8h6Q8qq7fu5OpgOocEN7CqtPvk5CX-y1o55tduWJ4FjR4dq0idwixNOYWvRUriXAE"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87756" data-verses="Ephesians 1:7">Verse 7</span> says that redemption is according to the riches of God’s grace. According to our concept, it would be easy for God to forgive us because He is sovereign and almighty. However, it was not that easy. The accomplishment of redemption was a very weighty and serious matter. Because of its seriousness, it required the riches of God’s grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUma2oJQ_XNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0"> Now we need to consider why redemption required the riches of God’s grace. The Bible says that without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins. Therefore, in order for us to be forgiven, blood had to be shed. But in this matter the blood of animals could not avail (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87757" data-verses="Hebrews 10:4">Heb. 10:4</span>). The blood of the animal sacrifices was simply a shadow. For the actual accomplishment of redemption, there had to be the blood of a higher life, a blood altogether sinless. Where could God find this kind of blood among the human race? It was impossible because all men are sinful. Among the fallen human race there is no sinless blood. Moreover, God’s chosen ones number in the millions. If a sin offering were to be offered for each one, millions of sin offerings would be required. Therefore, in addition to a perfect, sinless blood, there was the need of a sin offering that could include millions. This indicates that the blood through which redemption was to be accomplished had to be not only <span class="pg" data-page-id="59" id="59">[59]</span> sinless, but also all-inclusive, able to redeem the millions of God’s chosen ones. Only Jesus Christ could be the sin offering with a sinless blood shed for these millions of chosen ones. By the shedding of His blood once upon the cross, the eternal redemption of God’s chosen ones was accomplished once for all (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87758" data-verses="Hebrews 9:28">Heb. 9:28</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87759" data-verses="Hebrews 10:10">10:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87760" data-verses="Hebrews 10:12">12</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="7_JcBoLt_f4p4TwS9GhdcDPqe4eCL0dHgTG9jncdwDuWZJuJ-gcIVOYb7Z2qhulnR"> Now we need to see how it was possible for God to obtain such a sinless and all-inclusive blood. Obtaining such a blood was vastly more difficult than creating the universe. In order to create the universe, God simply had to speak. For example, He said, “Let there be light,” and there was light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87761" data-verses="Genesis 1:3">Gen. 1:3</span>). But redemption could not take place in this way. God could not simply say, “Let redemption be accomplished.” In order for God to create the universe there was no need of grace. But for Him to accomplish redemption, there was the need of the riches of His grace. </p>

Therefore, we should not isolate any verse, clause, or phrase from the whole sentence. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87771" data-verses="Ephesians 1:5">Verse 5</span> says that God has predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will. The praise of the glory of God’s grace spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87772" data-verses="Ephesians 1:6">verse 6</span> is the issue of the sonship in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87773" data-verses="Ephesians 1:5">verse 5</span>. Sonship is altogether a matter of grace. God’s grace makes us sons of God. The Spirit of the Son, the life of the Son, the position of the Son, the image of the Son, the completion of sonship, and the inheritance of all that God is in the sonship are all matters of grace. As we have pointed out, grace is God Himself. God Himself has come to accomplish everything for us that we may be His sons with the full sonship. With this grace God has graced us in the Beloved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87774" data-verses="Ephesians 1:6">v. 6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="kW37bRWd4n3ChsU9j6t193oGYSZXZNT7Km646Yo-l1oZoLWUehit8wxR0xamoxSLO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87775" data-verses="Ephesians 1:7">Verse 7</span> reveals that God’s grace has accomplished redemption for us and has applied forgiveness to us. The accomplishment of redemption began with Christ’s incarnation and continued through His ascension. When He ascended to the heavens, redemption was fully accomplished. In His ascension God gave Him repentance and forgiveness to pour out through the coming of the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87776" data-verses="Acts 5:31">Acts 5:31</span>). The coming of the Spirit refers to Christ’s descension. Beginning at the time of His descension, repentance and forgiveness were brought down to earth and poured out upon God’s chosen ones. As a result, we have repentance; repentance has been poured into our heart. After repentance came forgiveness. Through the accomplishment of redemption and the application of forgiveness, we <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> have been regenerated to become sons of God. All this is according to the riches of God’s grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jf0PJ3Yzh-Zban-Z3PEii4PLlX0b56DqyCleWzpwECAyBCCrwndk4EBUpamTJ1Vjs"> Even more of God’s grace is revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87777" data-verses="Ephesians 1:8">verse 8</span>, which says that God has caused His grace to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87778" data-verses="Ephesians 1:9">verse 9</span> says, “Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87779" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">Verse 10</span> speaks of the heading up of all things in Christ, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87780" data-verses="Ephesians 1:11">verse 11</span>, of the fact that we have been made an inheritance, “having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One Who operates all things according to the counsel of His will.” God’s abounding grace has made us God’s inheritance, God’s possession. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87781" data-verses="Ephesians 1:14">Verse 14</span> indicates that we also shall have an inheritance. By God’s grace we are made His inheritance, and by His grace He is made our inheritance. What abounding grace! <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87782" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3-14">Verses 3 through 14</span> are filled with God’s well-speaking concerning us. These verses also need to be our well-speaking concerning Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="ziHhFbwj9qduVCwT62zA_ZS2hUWcCVUD31ttVpb1c14zDjDyuEyTtvwQz3ufe66GN"> The phrase “the praise of His glory” is found three times in this portion of the Word, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87783" data-verses="Ephesians 1:6">verses 6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87784" data-verses="Ephesians 1:12">12</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87785" data-verses="Ephesians 1:14">14</span>. Each time it is used as a conclusion to the well-speaking of the Triune God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87786" data-verses="Ephesians 1:6">verse 6</span> it is a conclusion of the well-speaking of God the Father; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87787" data-verses="Ephesians 1:12">verse 12</span>, of the well-speaking of God the Son; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87788" data-verses="Ephesians 1:14">verse 14</span>, of the well-speaking of God the Spirit. The three uses of this phrase point to the Three of the Godhead in His well-speaking. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="a-sefdyyFRnPSiT6ZZ18VpqlgG9saTLq-KbZep_8kFXpjCLum-lwALY397Cqj_hpR">I. THE MYSTERY HAVING BEEN HIDDEN<br/>THROUGH THE AGES</h2><p data-content-id="bx_UdsKHw-vHF3mnF2hC5zE1rzAELWM1-A9auvEbkRZG4a2E4SntYRIkifhdfEuRY"> In this message we come to the mystery of God’s will. God’s will has a mystery, a mystery that has been hidden through the ages (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87789" data-verses="Ephesians 3:5">3:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87790" data-verses="Colossians 1:26">Col. 1:26</span>). The universe is a mystery. Why is there a heaven, and why does the earth exist? Why are there so many millions of items in the universe? Why is man here on earth? All these questions are mysteries and have given rise to many different philosophies. The mystery, which is the will of God, has been made known to the church through the apostles. A will is an intention, and the will of <span class="pg" data-page-id="65" id="65">[65]</span> God is God’s intention. God’s intention is intimately related to the desire of His heart. Thus, the mystery of the universe is a matter of God’s will, which is related to the desire of God’s heart. We need to know the mystery, the will of God, and the desire of God’s heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="MiS0T4a3KCiS0HGposEC8jSUoqKJAv0mQ1p8RXf91j3qhYPyaQ4vSp2OaxeR_yzEI"> Some may say that God’s will and intention is to have the church and that the church is the desire of His heart. This is correct, but we need to ask what the church is. Many Christians, including Christian teachers, do not have a clear understanding concerning the church. The church is not simply a group of people. In ourselves we are not the church; we are pitiful sinners. The only way we can become the church is for God in His Son to work Himself into our being. Most Christians today do not see the crucial and vital matter that God in His Son is working Himself into His chosen and redeemed ones. They may know about God’s selection and redemption, and they may realize that they are the chosen and redeemed ones. But they do not see that the very God who has chosen and redeemed them desires, in the Person of the Son, to work Himself into them. Neither selection nor redemption is the goal. Both are steps toward the goal. God’s goal is to work Himself into our being. </p>
<p data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fBdSNPMXEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z"> I realize that such a word may sound strange to many. For years I was in various branches of Christianity: fundamental Christianity, the Brethren assemblies, the inner-life practices, and the Pentecostal movement. But I was never told that in the Person of the Son, God is working Himself into His redeemed ones. Nevertheless, this is the mystery of the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="inTRR5aqA6f3Zp0g5VCt5vC8jxBsQPP9fz0SGMS6TD8Ev1RYK0XGG-yq2bZI5h3Uz"> The New Testament proves that God is working Himself into us. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87791" data-verses="Ephesians 4:6">Eph. 4:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87792" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:5">2 Cor. 13:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87793" data-verses="John 14:17">John 14:17</span>). According to 1 John, we are in God, and God is in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87794" data-verses="1 John 4:15">4:15</span>). Furthermore, we abide in Him, and He abides in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87795" data-verses="John 15:4">John 15:4</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87796" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Philippians 1:21</span> the Apostle Paul could even say, “To me to live is Christ.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87797" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> he said that he lived no longer but that Christ lived in him. All these verses indicate that God in the Son is working Himself into us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="66" id="66">[66]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQgfI9Pvddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> A proper understanding of the church also reveals the same truth. The Bible says that the church is the Body of Christ. Some Christians, however, take this not as a fact, or reality, but merely as an illustration. How terrible! The church <em>is</em> the Body of Christ, the Head of which is Christ Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87798" data-verses="Colossians 1:18">Col. 1:18</span>). Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87799" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:12">1 Corinthians 12:12</span> reveals that the Body is Christ. Thus, Christ is not only the Head, but also the Body. This indicates that God is being wrought into us who are the members of the Body. This is also proved by the illustration of the vine in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87800" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87801" data-verses="John 15:5">John 15:5</span> the Lord Jesus said, “I am the vine, you are the branches.” Is not the vine in the branches? Certainly it is! This is the reason the Lord says, “Abide in Me and I in you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87802" data-verses="John 15:4">John 15:4</span>). Whatever the vine is, is in the branches. As branches of the vine and as members of the Body of Christ, whatever Christ is, is in us. This means that we have been made parts of Christ. Are not the branches of the vine parts of the vine? Yes, they are. Therefore, we must have the boldness to say, “I am a part of Christ.” Because the believers are parts of Christ, Paul could say that to him to live was Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bDftOVJW0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D"> The mystery of the universe is the church, and the church is a group of people into whom God is working Himself. Eventually, the church will be fully saturated with God and will consummately become the holy city, the New Jerusalem. The church will not only be saturated with God but also mingled with Him. This does not mean, however, that we shall become the Godhead. No, this is neither what we say nor what we mean. Nevertheless, as those who are being saturated with God and mingled with Him, we shall become the very expression of God. The New Jerusalem will be the corporate expression of God. As we have pointed out a number of times, both God on the throne (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87803" data-verses="Revelation 4:3">Rev. 4:3</span>) and the New Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87804" data-verses="Revelation 21:11">Rev. 21:11</span>) have the appearance of jasper. This means that the entire city has the appearance of God and is the expression of God. This is the mystery of the universe. </p>

<p data-content-id="_gz5R_nH5oLy8-la4zwars7pfBAZQijurKKMBUDGJR9KRsTuy0qXMYueEupKE4DZW"> In this message we come to the heading up of all things in Christ. To many of us, this may be an altogether new thought. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87809" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span> says, “Unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.” Instead of “to head up all things in Christ,” the King James Version says, “He might gather together in one all things in Christ.” This translation is inadequate. In Greek, the word translated “to head up” is a verbal form of the noun “head.” The proper translation of this verse is, “To head up all things in Christ.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="B77vULL4YXIHFFm6havIcY9hcVNL6oUVhHMvf-EO7Y7mN_8U3mz_Sb5pyhxZje63p">GOD’S ABOUNDING GRACE<br/>WORKING TO HEAD UP ALL THINGS</h2><p data-content-id="xOItbD1M_SnXcAkcMHRO0aDFkC_-JBIPiZ8yi6s5e1DrTLjV78UWPV1TgR921-jvh"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87810" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10-11">Verses 9 and 10</span> should not be isolated from the preceding verses, for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87811" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3-14">verses 3 through 14</span> are actually one long sentence. Because <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87812" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10-11">verses 9 and 10</span> are not independent sentences, we need to refer to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87813" data-verses="Ephesians 1:8-9">verses 7 and 8</span>, which speak of the riches of God’s grace and of the grace which He has caused to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence. If you read these four verses together, you will see that everything in them is related to the abounding grace. The abounding grace does so much for us. For instance, it makes us God’s inheritance, and it makes God our inheritance. In a family the children are the father’s inheritance. A man may be very wealthy, but if he has no children, he is actually poor and may think of himself as having nothing. This indicates that a father’s inheritance is his children. According to the Bible, <span class="pg" data-page-id="72" id="72">[72]</span> the more children we have, the richer we are. Nothing can compare with them. As the sons of God, we are God’s inheritance. The abounding grace makes us the sons of God and His inheritance. It will also make God our inheritance. In a family, not only are the children the inheritance of the father, but also the father is the inheritance of the children. Many children would testify that they would rather lose anything else than lose their father. The living father is the best inheritance. We are in the process of becoming God’s inheritance, and He is in the process of becoming our inheritance. This is made possible by God’s abounding grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="rzBtTvnnp8EWQ9SXyt4WJFpCEK0VQN18pC-iFM-wWF7biwez5fLvQHeKFo4_b1dI7"> The matter of the mutual inheritance, however, is not the end, for as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87814" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10-11">verses 9 and 10</span> indicate, the abounding grace will accomplish the heading up of all things in Christ. By the abounding grace certain things are taking place in the universe to bring about the heading up of all things in Christ. We need to see how the abounding grace is working this out. </p>
<p data-content-id="dvx25G8sssSYMALmWN9v-wwHL3yhgwN7G3_YIZuDLoUsHACVRNy6oYa6xgCQFEpxU"> Before we consider this, we need to say a word about the church people in the Lord’s recovery. Although we are small in number, we are the most important people on earth, more important than government leaders, military leaders, or leaders in industry. Most Christians, however, have not seen the vision that the grace that has accomplished redemption, applied forgiveness, and regenerated us and that now is operating in us to make us God’s inheritance and to make Him ours is also working to head up all things in Christ. Christian preachers and teachers do not speak of this, and Christian books do not mention it. They do not cover the crucial point that the abounding grace is working on the church people so that all things might be headed up in Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8h6Q8qq7fu5OpgOocEN7CqtPhk5Cf-y1o55tduWJ4FjR4dq0idwixNOYWvRUriXAE">THE ISSUE OF MANY ITEMS</h2><p data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUma4oJQ3XNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0"> We have seen that the heading up of all things is mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87815" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">verse 10</span>. But this verse does not stand alone; it is the continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87816" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3-9">verses 3 through 9</span>. This indicates that the heading up of all things is the issue of all the items covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87817" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3-9">verses 3 through 9</span>: selection, predestination, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="73" id="73">[73]</span> praise of the glory of God’s grace, being graced in the Beloved, having redemption and forgiveness, and having God’s grace abound to us in all wisdom and prudence. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87818" data-verses="Ephesians 1:9">Verse 9</span> speaks of the mystery of God’s will according to the good pleasure which He purposed in Himself. Then we have <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87819" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">verse 10</span>, which speaks of the heading up of all things in Christ. The infinitive “to head up” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87820" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">verse 10</span> is related to all the preceding things in the foregoing verses. This means that God chose us that He may head up all things in Christ. He predestinated us unto sonship that He may head up all things in Christ. He accomplished redemption for us through the blood of Christ in order to head up all things in Christ. God has graced us and caused grace to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence that He may head up all things in Christ. The heading up of all things in Christ is the issue of all these things. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7_JcBoLt_f4p4TwS9GhdcDPqQ4eOJ0dHgTG9jncdwDuWZJuJ-gcIVOYb7Z2qhulnR">THE CONSUMMATE GOAL</h2><p data-content-id="_gz5R_nH5oLy8-la4zwars7pfBAIZijurKKMBUDGJR9KRsTuy0qXMYueEupKE4DZW"> Many Christians have never realized that God has chosen us, predestinated us, redeemed us, forgiven us, and graced us for the purpose of heading up all things in Christ. Have you ever realized that you were chosen and predestinated so that God might head up all things? Have you ever considered that God redeemed you and forgave you of your sins in order to head up all things? Christians may know a great deal about God’s selection and predestination without knowing how these are related to the heading up of all things in Christ. We ourselves may not even be clear about this. We are accustomed to saying that God’s goal is neither holiness nor spirituality, but the church. But the ultimate goal is not even the church; it is the heading up of all things in Christ. Yes, the church is the goal, but not the consummate goal, the goal in the last stage. Rather, it is the goal in the first stage. The consummate goal is the heading up of all things in Christ. This concept is found only in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87821" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span>, not in any other verse in the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="B77vULL4YXIHFFm6havIcY9hcVNW0oUVhHMvf-EO7Y7mN_8U3mz_Sb5pyhxZje63p"> God has made Christ the Head over all things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87822" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22">v. 22</span>). Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and new earth. This will be God’s eternal administration and economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xOItbD1M_SnXcAkcMHRO0aDFkC_nGBIPiZ8yi6s5e1DrTLjV78UWPV1TgR921-jvh">THE CHURCH SHARING THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="rzBtTvnnp8EWQ9SXyt4WJFpCEK0wcN18pC-iFM-wWF7biwez5fLvQHeKFo4_b1dI7"> In order to head up all things in Christ, God firstly heads up His chosen ones. Therefore, the church life is a life of being headed up. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87823" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22-23">Ephesians 1:22 and 23</span> say, “And He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One Who fills all in all.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87824" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22">Verse 22</span> says that God gave Christ to be the Head over all things. This indicates that He is not merely the Head of the church, but over all things. God gave Christ to be the Head over all things <em>to</em> the church. The little word “to” implies transmission. It indicates that Christ’s headship is being transmitted to the church. This means that, in a sense, we can share the headship of Christ over all things. Although we are not the head, we can share the headship. To put it another way, we are not the king, but we can share the kingship. </p>

The word “dispensation” is also found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87840" data-verses="Ephesians 3:2">3:2</span>, “If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward.” The dispensation of the grace of God means the administration of the grace of God. </p>

According to this plan, He created the universe with the heavens, the earth, and billions of items. He then created mankind as the center of the universe to be a vessel to contain God for God’s expression. This word is brief, but it <span class="pg" data-page-id="82" id="82">[82]</span> covers the whole Bible. Man was created not to be an instrument, but a vessel to contain God so that God may be expressed from within man. This is God’s eternal plan, His eternal purpose. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Y7KPbnfhmVACkNVkC3njcSp9zkikIRrpc5RUdAorxwk76X6_8r4-6ikKrq_X9AheN">SATAN BRINGING DEATH TO GOD’S CREATION</h2><p data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR0sRBZ2GWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB"> In His wisdom God allowed an archangel to rebel. Without God’s permission, no rebellion could ever take place. Not even the rebellion among the angels could happen without God’s permission. God allowed one of His angels to rebel against Him. This was according to God’s wisdom. Satan’s rebellion serves in the same way as the black background of a painting that makes the main object all the more outstanding. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4e6WofBDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> The book of Genesis reveals that Satan came to inject himself into man, who was the center of the universe. When Satan injected himself into man, Satan became death and darkness to man. Whenever Satan comes to us or into our home, there is death and darkness. The result of this death and darkness is a collapse. A person who is full of life can stand upright. But when the power of death has been injected into him, he falls down; he collapses. Instead of being headed up, he collapses into a heap. As we pointed out in the foregoing message, the entire universe, including mankind, is a heap of collapse caused by Satan injecting himself as the factor of death into God’s creation. Satan has brought death to the entire creation of God. All of creation has been infected by the death factor of Satan. This is the reason that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87841" data-verses="Romans 8:20-21">Romans 8:20 and 21</span> say that the creation has been subjected to vanity and is under the slavery of corruption. </p>
<p data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAzukTlZlH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9"> In order to inject a substance into a person’s body, there is no need to inject it into every part. Instead, the injection is made at a certain spot, and then the substance spreads throughout the body. Likewise, Satan injected himself into man, the center of the universe, and from man Satan’s poison has spread everywhere. Therefore, not only is man subject to death, but also every living thing is subject to it. <span class="pg" data-page-id="83" id="83">[83]</span> Whenever any living thing dies, it collapses. The element of death has spread into every part of God’s creation, causing the creation to collapse into a heap. </p>
<p data-content-id="wZZd7ZXC7lqDMlD_3-HJuDfTc2ipKM5RxitkD5PpVOrwkpldqqeIgnRv2-Kvi2tyM"> The collapse of the universe gives God an excellent opportunity to manifest His wisdom. Without such a situation of death and collapse, God’s wisdom could not be fully manifested. Through the church God’s manifold wisdom will be expressed. The collapse caused by Satan’s injection of the factor of death into man serves as the black background to make God’s wisdom all the more glorious. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5eu1ryI5O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6"> Satan’s way is always to act ahead of God. This is a principle in the Bible. Whenever God wants to do something, Satan acts first. For example, the Bible reveals that God’s intention is to build a city, the New Jerusalem. But the first city was a counterfeit one built by Satan. Likewise, God’s intention is to impart Himself into man and to work Himself into man. But before God did this, His enemy, Satan, came in to do a counterfeit work by injecting himself into man. After God created man, He placed him in front of the tree of life. This indicates that God desired man to take Him in. God is never in a hurry; He is always willing to wait. Satan, on the contrary, is always in a rush. We need to learn from this that anything that we do hurriedly is probably not of God, but of Satan. Before God dispensed Himself into man, Satan injected himself into man, the center of God’s creation, and thereby caused the entire creation to collapse. Now instead of life, there is death everywhere: in the offices, factories, businesses, schools, and even in the so-called churches. Because death is everywhere and in everything, everything is in a state of collapse. This is the background of God’s working Himself into man. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6ox6PdlgLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9">MAN BEING A BATTLEFIELD</h2><p data-content-id="ZF7iQ7T0lQJP8gtIC7nMKHRysLd4AgK5Boj8tqPtmmD8KvxV6FuuLU1d_HGholgwP"> God has come to work Himself into man, not into man as originally created by Him, but into the man whom Satan has injected with himself. Because both Satan and God are in man, man has become a battlefield between God and Satan. Originally, God and Satan were fighting in the universe, but <span class="pg" data-page-id="84" id="84">[84]</span> now they are fighting within man. Do you realize that you are a battlefield and that a war is raging within between God and Satan? As Christians, we have a war raging within us. The factor of death is fighting against the factor of life, and the factor of life is conquering, subduing, and swallowing up the factor of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OIqZSb02SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH"> The use of antibiotics illustrates this. When an antibiotic gets into our bodies, it fights against the germs. Jesus Christ is the best antibiotic. From the day we received Him, a war has been raging within us. Day after day Christ, the heavenly antibiotic, kills the germs. Because the poison of death had been injected into us, we collapsed into a heap. But when Christ came in, the factor of life came in with Him, and gradually we began to rise up, not by being taught, but by taking the factor of life into our being. The more life we receive, the more we rise up. However, even after we have received Christ, the enemy may inject still more of the factor of death into us and cause us to collapse once again. At such a time, we need a further injection of the heavenly antibiotic. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2etQRK13kgmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg">RISING UP AND BECOMING ATTACHED</h2><p data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiEvkr6ju8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND"> The collapse comes from the factor of death, and the rising up comes from the factor of life. When the factor of death causes a collapse, all the parts of our being become detached from one another. This is illustrated by the dry bones in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87842" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:1">Ezekiel 37</span>. When those bones were dead and dry, they were detached. But when the breath entered into them, they became living, they rose up, and they were attached (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87843" data-verses="Ezekiel 37:4-10">Ezek. 37:4-10</span>). This rising up and attaching is actually the heading up. Formerly, the bones were piled in a heap, each of them detached from the body. But when the breath of life entered into these dead bones, they firstly rose up and then became attached to one another. After this they became a body, and even an army. This is what it means to be headed up. </p>

<p data-content-id="5tbeNC7n4bELsmeplIXgNzTijgwzSKoF26Q5SKhmn5Z95j36NkbT_ysCBWMthTXfH"> This message is a further continuation of the heading up of all things in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87848" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">1:10</span>). First we need to see what is the fullness of the times. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87849" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span> says, “Unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.” The word “unto” means “resulting in” or “in order to have.” The dispensation in this verse is that of the fullness of the times. The times here no doubt refer to the ages. Hence, the fullness of the times is the fullness of the ages. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyF300ioXOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi">THE FOUR AGES</h2><p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyT_NtHNbr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> In the Bible there are four different ages. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87850" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span> says, “For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.” Here we see that the law is related to Moses and grace to Jesus Christ. Two ages are implied here: the age of the law and the age of grace. When Moses was raised up, that was the beginning of the age of the law. When Christ came, that was the beginning of the age of grace. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87851" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span> mentions Adam and Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87852" data-verses="Romans 5:14">v. 14</span>). Sin is related to Adam, and, as we have seen, the law is related to Moses. Therefore, we have three persons—Adam, Moses, and Christ—and three things—sin, law, and grace. Adam is related to sin, Moses is related to the law, and Christ is related to grace. This indicates that from Adam to the second coming of Christ there are three ages: the age of sin, the age of the law, and the age of grace. <span class="pg" data-page-id="90" id="90">[90]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8rSBawpeiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> Many of you are familiar with the theological teaching of the seven dispensations, the dispensations of innocence, conscience, human government, promise, law, grace, and the kingdom. It is not incorrect to say that there are seven such dispensations. But according to the record of the Bible, we may say that prior to the millennium there are just three ages, the ages of Adam, Moses, and Christ. After the age of grace, the age of the kingdom will come. This will be the thousand years of the heavenly reign on earth. Therefore, altogether there are four ages: the age of sin, the age of the law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxi-ysjGWAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy"> These four ages are the times. Before the first of these ages began, there was not time, but eternity past. And after these four ages there will no longer be time; instead, there will be eternity future. Between the two ends of eternity, eternity past and future, there are four ages, four times. The time of Adam was of sin, the time of Moses was of the law, the time of Christ is of grace, and the time of the millennium will be of the kingdom. When these four times have been fulfilled, that will be the fullness of the times, the completion of the ages. The ages of Adam and Moses have been completed, the age of grace is being completed, and the age of the millennium has not yet begun. After the completion of the fourth age, there will be a dispensation called by Paul the fullness of the times. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9PoVFU_TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> When Paul was on earth, there was a dispensation which he called a stewardship of grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87853" data-verses="Ephesians 3:2">3:2</span>). Not only at the time of Paul was there a dispensation, but there has been one in every age, in the age of Adam, in the age of the law, and in the age of grace, and there will certainly be one in the coming age of the kingdom. At the fullness of the ages, there will be the consummate, the ultimate, dispensation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KinSpiWncXMNo5T64K5GnF2njvJMKAmz0SWiBllAApDxAJJy3NRnyUU_zHhMXOBI9">THE MEANING OF DISPENSATION</h2><p data-content-id="lwsB7fTo0YBNqEyc92s8YZtdauR5h2669bSShh3cXlYnPCMXGJH6EofNa-wN0fGTI"> Now we need to understand what a dispensation is. According to one teaching, a dispensation refers to an age. However, this understanding is not accurate. Another teaching is that a dispensation refers to the way God deals with <span class="pg" data-page-id="91" id="91">[91]</span> people during a particular period of time. For example, in the dispensation of innocence God dealt with man in one way, and in the dispensation of conscience He dealt with man in another way. Likewise, God deals with people in different ways in the ages of human government, promise, law, grace, and the kingdom. This understanding of dispensation is not incorrect, but it falls short. A dispensation is the act or instance of dispensing. It refers to God’s dispensing of Himself into His chosen people. Although I have studied this matter of the dispensations for many years and have studied a number of diagrams, I have never been told that God’s dispensation is the dispensing of Himself into His people. We need to forget all the diagrams and remember one basic point: God is now dispensing Himself into us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ORuveXsLSL_KAUQRmmsRwUArmxfJgsZhadewDeZFVr0RNBcjRKpEUgJ7ZofkxfD26">THE DISPENSING OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="4hu3V9NSxOD4qIDQx-aI8nybPXQARHAukquOkznsExY9T1eCWD6YHuZmIvOhld_9j"> As we have pointed out, when Satan, the power of death, injected himself into man, Satan became death and darkness to man. Death brings in corruption, and darkness brings in confusion. Satan’s goal is to corrupt God’s creation and to cause confusion. But praise the Lord that where death abounds, life abounds all the more! After Satan came in to deaden, God came in to enliven, to impart life. Where there is life, there is light also. Death ruins, but life heals; darkness brings in confusion, but light brings in the proper order. We need to keep in mind that Satan came in to deaden God’s creation and that death ruins and darkness confuses. God, however, has come in to enliven the deadened creation and to bring in order. In this order all things are headed up in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="od6p5sc1GDqOFwWB01GI4UN1Avyh0TvvTOTFDcnJar4LT8Qnqe8UcaKDTX05Qn6K7"> God’s dispensation is the dispensing of life into people who have been deadened. Although Adam had become deadened, God came in to dispense something of Himself into Abel. He did the same with Enosh and Enoch. Do not think that in himself, a deadened person, Enoch was able to walk with God for three hundred years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87854" data-verses="Genesis 5:22">Gen. 5:22</span>). This was possible only through God’s dispensing of Himself into him. The same was true of Noah. Noah walked with God and had <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> strong faith because God was dispensing Himself into him. God’s dispensing of Himself began with Abel and has increased with each generation. Thus, the dispensation with Enoch was greater than with Enosh and greater with Noah than with Enoch. With Abraham it was still greater. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87855" data-verses="Acts 7:2">Acts 7:2</span> says that the God of glory appeared to Abraham. That appearing certainly was a dispensing. Abraham could have faith in God because God had been dispensed into him. </p>
<p data-content-id="3GEuFAt2o9byg8MZDzK996mX8fH3DXg_LkbTuP-LW2tuU3xrWTByUo7lMUOiCI2ZU"> The same thing happened to us when we heard the gospel and repented. As we were repenting and confessing our sins to God, God was dispensing Himself into us, although we might not have been conscious of God’s dispensing at the time. As we recall our experience, however, we realize that this was the case. On the day I repented and made confession to God of my sinfulness, something was dispensed into my being. I wept, but inwardly I was on fire. This was God’s inspiration and also His dispensation. When God comes to inspire us, He dispenses Himself into us. Nothing can change us like God’s dispensation. It can transform a robber into a saint, because it dispenses the holy nature of God into him. I encourage you all to go to the Lord for thirty minutes for His dispensation. During that time, forget your problems and your environment. Simply open to Him and confess your shortcomings and wrongdoings. The more you confess to Him, the more the way will be open for Him to dispense Himself into you. </p>
<p data-content-id="GJHsP88GHseo8rpjYyem_lGPSqQ1-4KrNMLYo1DtwblC8XXjSuatQl8WDTK_MeK3O"> No matter what term we use—dispensing, inspiring, transfusing, or infusing—the experience is the same. I do not care for terminology; I care for the divine element being imparted into you. We need God to get into us. We need the element of God to be wrought into our being. This is the meaning of dispensation. </p>

It means that so much will be worked out for us and in us by God’s abounding grace that all the angels and positive things in the universe will praise God. They will praise God because we, the sons of God, will be the center, the focal point, of God’s operation in the universe. We shall be like the hub of a wheel. If the hub is taken away, the wheel will collapse because the spokes have no support. The angels and the positive things in the universe are like the spokes, and we, the sons of God, are like the hub. Without such a hub the universe cannot be held together. We on whom, for whom, and in whom the abounding grace is accomplishing so much will become the cause for the praise uttered by the positive things in the universe. This is the right meaning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87871" data-verses="Ephesians 1:12">verse 12</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="jzy56D5a4K14njv2OL9Qfpno63H2C1Ab9R3e21WSu1YH0DQn4sk-OuELvP5dRJ2jv"> The little word “that” at the beginning of this verse is very meaningful. It indicates that the many things that have been taking place in the preceding verses have a certain result: that we should be to the praise of God’s glory. This praise will mainly be in the millennium and ultimately in the new heaven and the new earth. If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87872" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span> in the light of these verses from Ephesians, we shall see that the New Jerusalem is a constitution of the sons of God; it is the center of the new universe. The angels, the nations, and all the positive things surrounding us will behold us and spontaneously utter praise to God. Therefore, <span class="pg" data-page-id="98" id="98">[98]</span> the sons of God, the constituents of the New Jerusalem, will be the cause of universal praise. The whole universe will praise God for us as those who have been worked upon by God’s abounding grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="TS0vLm3wTVrzuTUulNHSpsNO3UDP-c-25mTg4xYz74KQnIYS77RmuCw_eSmkzr8AS"> However, many, including us, may read Ephesians again and again without seeing this because they do not have the proper concept. We understand the Bible mainly according to our concept. If a third-grader reads Ephesians, he may be able to say all the words, but he cannot grasp the real meaning because he does not have the proper concept. How much we grasp of the divine revelation depends mainly on the concepts we have. We should not trust in our natural concepts; instead, we should drop them. If we are willing to drop our concepts, the spirit of wisdom will replace our natural concepts with something spiritual, heavenly, and eternal. Our knowledge of doctrine will cause us to be veiled when we come to the book of Ephesians. Our concepts become veils over our spirit. But if we drop our concept, our spirit will be open, and we shall also be poor in spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87873" data-verses="Matthew 5:3">Matthew 5:3</span> the Lord Jesus said, “Blessed are the poor in spirit.” Those who are poor in spirit seem to know nothing, for they have been emptied of every concept, doctrine, and teaching. If we come to the pure Word poor in spirit, we shall see something new. </p>
<p data-content-id="nFupmXdU7v_F8Wz3VyT4gw6pOecPKqgfhZHMQs6SxdJFG3VrWN2G3kyhCMk9WVErP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87874" data-verses="Ephesians 1:11-12">verses 11 and 12</span> we see that the New Testament believers will be a cause of universal praise. Praise is the utterance of appreciation. We do not praise clay because we do not appreciate it. On the other hand, we do praise our dear Lord Jesus because we appreciate Him so much. Our appreciation becomes our praise. The day is coming when we, the sons of God, will be appreciated by all the angels. The more they look at us, the more utterance they will have that will flow out as praise to God. Their appreciation of us will become their praise to God. They will realize that what we are is the work of God’s abounding grace. The amount of praise depends upon how much work the abounding grace has done. If the abounding grace accomplishes more work upon us, the angels will have a greater appreciation of us. The Bible says that even the trees will rejoice (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87875" data-verses="Psalms 96:12">Psa. 96:12</span>) <span class="pg" data-page-id="99" id="99">[99]</span> and praise the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87876" data-verses="Psalms 148:7">Psa. 148:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87877" data-verses="Psalms 148:9">9</span>). If the trees did not see anything in the universe that was wonderful, they would not rejoice. But seeing us, the sons of God, will be the greatest surprise to the trees. Because of us, the trees will rejoice and praise. The fact that we shall be to the praise of God’s glory does not mean that we shall praise God. It means that we shall be the cause of the praise uttered by the angels and all the positive things in the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR0oZBZTMWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB"> Eventually, we shall become the glory of God. Some may wonder how we could become the glory of God. In 1 Thessalonians Paul says, “Ye are our glory and joy” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87878" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:20">2:20</span>). Paul was speaking here as the representative of God. Therefore, if the believers were the glory of Paul, then they were certainly the glory of God, for Paul was God’s sent one. If the believers are the glory of the sent one, then they are surely also the glory of the Sender. In the millennium and especially in the new heaven and new earth, God will be able to say, “Angels, nations, and all created things, look at My glory. My sons are My glory.” In a human sense, this is even true in a large family. Suppose a certain father has many good children, all of whom love the Lord very much. If all these children would one day sit around their father, he could say, “This is my glory. My children are my glory.” One day the Father will gather us all together. At that time, we all shall have been saturated with Him, transformed, and transfigured.

<p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4ayWo-KDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> Glory is God expressed. At the fullness of the times, all the sons of God will be fully saturated with God and will express God. God will be expressed through us. This expressed God is glory. All the angels and positive things in the universe will praise the expressed God. This is what it means to say that we shall be to the praise of His glory. </p>

However, Paul wrote this way purposely in order to emphasize the fact that all things in heaven and on earth are headed up in Christ. In emphasizing this fact, Paul did not care for excellence of composition. The words “in Whom” reveal that we have been placed into the heading-up Christ. </p>

The word “also” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87882" data-verses="Ephesians 1:11">verse 11</span> refers to the heading up of all things in Christ. All things are to be headed up in Christ, and we also have been made an inheritance in Him. In Christ we were made an inheritance. Please pay close attention to the tense here. In the future, all things will be headed up in Christ, but already we were made an inheritance in Him. The Greek words rendered “were made an inheritance” can also be translated “have obtained an inheritance.” The Greek verb means to choose or assign by lot. Hence, this clause literally means we were designated as a heritage. We were made an inheritance to inherit God’s inheritance. On the one hand, we were made God’s inheritance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87883" data-verses="Ephesians 1:18">v. 18</span>) for God’s enjoyment; and, on the other hand, we were made to inherit God as our inheritance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87884" data-verses="Ephesians 1:14">v. 14</span>) for our enjoyment. </p>

I would say that being made an inheritance is much better than being headed up. Our being made God’s inheritance opens the way for Him to head up all things in the universe. </p>

God the Father has purposed, God the Son has accomplished what the Father purposed, and God the Spirit is applying what the Son accomplished according to the Father’s purpose. Therefore, the Father purposed, the Son accomplished, and the Spirit applies. In these verses we have a purpose, an accomplishment, and an application.

The Spirit’s application is His sealing and His pledging. Actually, the Spirit Himself is both the seal and the pledge. Both the seal of the Spirit and the pledge of the Spirit involve movement within us. Therefore, the seal is actually the sealing, and the pledge, the pledging. Not only is the Spirit a seal upon us, but He is now sealing us. Not only is He a pledge guaranteeing our inheritance, but He is now pledging within us. In this message we shall consider the sealing of the Spirit, and in the next message, the pledging. </p>

I also read about this matter. But I never heard about the sealing of the Spirit. The seal is one thing, and the sealing is another. To be <span class="pg" data-page-id="106" id="106">[106]</span> sealed with the Holy Spirit means to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal. We have been made God’s inheritance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87893" data-verses="Ephesians 1:11">v. 11</span>). At the time we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God. The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God’s image signified by the seal, thus making us like God. Suppose a brother puts a seal on his Bible. When he does so, his Bible bears the image of the seal. This seal indicates that the Bible belongs to him. Therefore, the seal signifies ownership. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God sealed us. This signifies that God is our owner and that we belong to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="-xjGehvejCQlzalTuo32KU2fQU9CfuPgtsH4FEYaUB1lCP61PJ3xPUdWBlbNL_kSt"> When I was young, I was told strongly that I belonged to God. I was also taught that no matter how much we grieved the Holy Spirit, He would never leave us. Those from the Arminian school of theology, however, disagree with this. Years ago a German mission in China published a booklet concerning the Spirit. One of the pictures in this booklet showed a dove, signifying the Holy Spirit, flying away from a believer who had grieved Him. The Brethren attacked this teaching, saying that after the Holy Spirit has come into us, He never leaves. Their teaching regarding the seal of the Holy Spirit was very strong. They said, “Once the seal has been put on you, it cannot be taken away, no matter what you do.” I agree with the teaching that the Spirit will never leave us. In this matter the Brethren were correct; however, they were too doctrinal. </p>

If the seal is square, then the image is also square. The Spirit as the seal of God upon us bears the image of God. This implies that the seal of the Holy Spirit is the expression of God. When you bear the Holy Spirit as the seal of God upon you, you bear the image of God and the expression of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="EkaMV3Soowz1Y1LdwSAggraE6cxws6M0H0MN5WrZ4ZYcDUwX2c921mm7c4iIL8IZY"> When I first read about this in a book by Brother Nee, I was very happy. Not only did I have the seal indicating that <span class="pg" data-page-id="107" id="107">[107]</span> God was my owner, but along with this seal I had the image of God. That happiness, however, did not last very long. After a short while, I discovered that I did not actually have the image of God. Yes, the seal of the Spirit was upon me, but I did not have the image. The seal was one thing and I was another. I had the seal upon me, but I did not live a life of the seal. </p>
<p data-content-id="D20V42Q_F8EMHQVYOrygvO7Bw2B2s4EAp5I6xaxu5BS3a8z8gUxLYQQk1sl7LSiAO"> Whenever we come to know a certain truth or doctrine apart from experience, we shall eventually be troubled by our lack of experience. The doctrine may be very good, but we may have very little experience of it. This causes us to be puzzled, for the Bible says one thing and our experience says another. What we are simply does not correspond with what the Bible says. The Bible says that we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit. This means that we bear the image, the expression, of God. However, according to our experience, it seems that we do not have the seal or the image. I do not want to be deceived. I am troubled whenever the Bible says one thing and my daily life says another. Later I found the secret in the matter of the seal in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87894" data-verses="Ephesians 1:13-14">1:13 and 14</span>. </p>

We have been sealed with the Holy Spirit unto the redemption of the acquired possession. We are God’s acquired possession, and the redemption of the acquired possession is the redemption, the transfiguration, of our body. By this we see that the seal of the Holy Spirit is for the redemption of our body. We were sealed with the Holy Spirit with a view to this redemption. One translation says, “You were sealed with the Holy Spirit given to the redemption.” This is an even stronger expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="e7TeZuy6ip5trkTcKOr38frR6Db6mup2tVAiVqlMGn0mLpxnTuxCJvbcyNlyALCaC"> The seal of the Spirit is not a once-for-all matter. Rather, <span class="pg" data-page-id="108" id="108">[108]</span> the sealing is still taking place. The seal was put in us when we believed, but the sealing has been going on from that time until now. The Holy Spirit is the seal and also the sealing. He is still sealing us. We were sealed and we are still being sealed. </p>
<p data-content-id="5tbeNC7n4bELsmeplIXgNzTihgwifKoF26Q5SKhmn5Z95j36NkbT_ysCBWMthTXfH"> Many of us can testify from experience that when we believed in the Lord Jesus, we realized that we had been sealed in our spirit. However, in our mind, emotion, and will there was no sealing. At the time we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit came into our spirit and sealed us there. For this reason the Bible says that we were sealed. However, not every part of our being was sealed, but just one part, our spirit. For a long time after we were saved, there continued to be no sealing in our mind, emotion, or will. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87896" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span> says that we were sealed unto redemption. We have pointed out that the word “unto” means “resulting in” or “with a view to.” Therefore, the sealing in our spirit is with a view to the redemption of our body. This implies that the sealing is spreading within us. It begins in our spirit and it is spreading into our mind, emotion, and will. Because the sealing is spreading into our mind, the New Testament speaks about the renewing of the mind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87897" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Rom. 12:2</span>). The renewing of the mind is the spreading of the sealing of the Spirit into our mind. The sealing of the Spirit must saturate our mind. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyF320i1VOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi">A CONTINUING PROCESS</h2><p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyT_PtHUYr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> Not many Christians have seen that the sealing is still going on, that it is not once for all. No doubt, the Spirit comes into us once for all, but the sealing of the Spirit is a continuing process. In this matter we should care not merely for doctrine, but also for experience. Check to see whether your experience corresponds with the doctrine. </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8rSDawAUiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> At the time of regeneration, the seal of the Spirit was put into our spirit, and the sealing began within us, with a view to the redemption of our body. This indicates that one day even our body will be sealed with the Spirit. Our body will be saturated with the Holy Spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="109" id="109">[109]</span> </p>

It is difficult to say which comes first, the sealing or the pledging. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87901" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:21-22">2 Corinthians 1:21 and 22</span>, the sealing seems to come first. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87902" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:22">Second Corinthians 1:22</span> says that God “hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.” However, both the sealing and the pledging actually take place at the same time. </p>

Our inheritance is God Himself. In God’s economy we are an inheritance to God, and God is an inheritance to us. This is a mutual inheritance. For us to be God’s inheritance, we need the sealing. We are God’s possession, and as our owner, God has put a seal upon us. Because God is our inheritance, we also need the pledging of the Holy Spirit as a guarantee. We shall inherit all that God is, that is, His Person, and all that God has, that is, His work. For such an inheritance, the Holy Spirit is the pledge, the guarantee. <span class="pg" data-page-id="114" id="114">[114]</span> </p>

The Greek word for “pledge” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87905" data-verses="Ephesians 1:14">verse 14</span> also means foretaste, guarantee, token payment guaranteeing the full payment, a part payment in advance. Since we are God’s inheritance, the Holy Spirit is a seal upon us. Since God is our inheritance, the Holy Spirit is a pledge of this inheritance to us. God gives His Holy Spirit to us, not only as a guarantee of our inheritance, securing our heritage, but also as a foretaste of what we shall inherit of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4agSsKx5XOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1"> In ancient times, the Greek word for pledge was used in the purchase of land. The seller gave the buyer a sample of the soil from the land being purchased. Hence, a pledge, according to ancient Greek usage, was also a sample. The Holy Spirit is the sample of what we shall inherit of God in full. </p>
<p data-content-id="IYKcWTBZD2wraBqVv8VOsOtLednZAu5Z92lk4lPzJmdAd2biN-nCndK5RLnSYtepK"> The Greek word for “pledge” is somewhat equal to today’s down payment, which indicates good faith and is a guarantee of coming payments. Pledge, earnest, and guarantee—all these words are about the same in meaning, all referring to a payment that guarantees the balance. But the Greek word in addition signifies a sample, a foretaste. Some translators prefer the word “foretaste.” By enjoying the sample we have a foretaste of what is coming. Suppose someone gives me ten peaches from his peach orchard. These peaches are a sample and a foretaste of the produce of the whole orchard. As those who are to inherit God, we have the Holy Spirit as a pledge, guarantee, earnest, and down payment of our inheritance. At the same time the Holy Spirit is also a sample and a foretaste. The foretaste gives us a taste of God; the full taste is yet to come. </p>
<p data-content-id="HfUkPNVdvPc-TGtNi_PIz-v0x1zqU3n27HnTj40Roiaxg_VGkAzUncYLNZiT2Ke0a"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87906" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:1">2 Corinthians 1</span> we have the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87907" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:21">Second Corinthians 1:21</span> says, “Now he who firmly attaches us with you unto the anointed One, and hath anointed us, is God” (Gk.). The anointing brings the element of God into us. The divine ointment can be compared to paint. When you paint furniture, you apply the <span class="pg" data-page-id="115" id="115">[115]</span> element of the paint to the furniture. Likewise, the anointing puts the divine ointment upon us, and this brings the divine element into us. The more of the anointing we have within, the more of the element of God we receive. We need to be coated with the divine ointment again and again. Many of the older brothers and sisters have received hundreds of coatings, but the younger ones have received just a few. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87908" data-verses="1John 2:1">First John 2</span> says that the anointing abides in us and teaches us. We are taught by being anointed. The Holy Spirit as the compound ointment within us teaches us, not by words, but by painting us. Whether we obey His teaching or not, He still anoints us, putting coat after coat upon us. In this way the anointing brings the very essence of God into our being. </p>
<p data-content-id="XN29daXoEaiDc-NwR9H8WYC_KCQLWqlHCNZd9RwShWBkL98XRz-1aU8fWCfEcI9un"> I praise the Lord that there is a greater dispensation of God Himself today than there was in the first century. If you study the writings of the early church fathers, you will find that their writings cannot compare with what the Lord has shown us in His Word. Which of the church fathers ever said that God is dispensing Himself into our being? Even certain things uttered by the young people today are superior to what was written by the church fathers. Day by day we are being anointed, and the divine essence is added to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="kW37bRWd4n3ChsU9j6t193oCcSZGWNT7Km646Yo-l1oZoLWUehit8wxR0xamoxSLO"> After the anointing, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87909" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:1">2 Corinthians 1</span> mentions the sealing. The sealing of the Holy Spirit brings in the image, the appearance, and the expression, for the seal bears the sign, the form. God is not only anointing us with His essence; He is also sealing us with His appearance, image, and expression. Along with the anointing and the sealing there is the pledging, which is a matter of enjoyment and taste. Mothers realize that in feeding their children they need to make the food tasteful. When food is delicious, the children are eager to come to the table at mealtime. But if the food does not have a pleasant taste, it will be difficult to get the children to eat. The Holy Spirit is within us today as a foretaste. If the Spirit were only the anointing and the sealing, we might become bored with the experience of the Spirit. But we are <span class="pg" data-page-id="116" id="116">[116]</span> not tired or bored of the Spirit because the Spirit is also pledging within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jf0PJ3Yzh-Zban-Z3PEii4PPhX0G16DqyCleWzpwECAyBCCrwndk4EBUpamTJ1Vjs"> In the past I was taught that the pledge of the Holy Spirit was a once-for-all, objective matter. But later I learned that the Spirit is not only the pledge, but also the pledging. This pledging is a continual matter. I learned this, not from studying, but from experience. In my experience I came to realize that a pledging was continually taking place within me. </p>
<p data-content-id="ziHhFbwj9qduVCwT62zA_ZSylUWFPVUD31ttVpb1c14zDjDyuEyTtvwQz3ufe66GN"> The pledging of the Spirit is given for our enjoyment. Whenever I am disappointed or depressed, the pledging comes in to uplift me. I experience this pledging daily, even hourly. Pledging also means that something is given to us as a guarantee. Through the Spirit’s pledging, we are encouraged and stirred up. Whenever we feel that the situation is hopeless, the pledging fills us with hope. </p>
<p data-content-id="a-sefdyyFRnPSiT6ZZ18VpqhkG9JYTLq-KbZep_8kFXpjCLum-lwALY397Cqj_hpR"> On the day we were saved, God began to pledge Himself to us, and this pledging continues day by day. It is very difficult for a Christian in the spirit to not believe that God is with him. We easily and spontaneously believe this because we daily receive the pledging of the Spirit. God is pledging all the time. When I am weak, He pledges Himself to me and becomes my encouragement. When my expectations are low, He pledges Himself, and I have hope once again. When it seems that my faith has ebbed away, He pledges Himself to me, and immediately my faith revives. When it seems that I have no more love for the brothers and sisters, the Spirit pledges Himself, and more love for the saints flows in. I believe that we have all had experiences like this, although we may not have recognized or understood these experiences. </p>
<p data-content-id="bx_UdsKHw-vHF3mnF2hC5zExvzAlIWM1-A9auvEbkRZG4a2E4SntYRIkifhdfEuRY"> During the special ten-day trainings, I speak three times a day. Some may wonder how I have the energy to speak so much at my age. Many times I have been exhausted and tired by speaking. But whenever I have this sense of tiredness, God immediately comes in to pledge Himself to me. Because of the Spirit’s pledging, I am ready to speak again at the next meeting. When I stand up and begin to speak, I <span class="pg" data-page-id="117" id="117">[117]</span> am full of energy because of the pledging of the Holy Spirit. In fact, the more I speak, the more enjoyment I have. When I return home after giving a message, I am exceedingly happy, much happier than before the meeting. The reason for this is that during my speaking I receive a great deal of the Spirit’s pledging. </p>

<p data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUme0oJJ8XNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0"> In considering these matters, we come to the first prayer of the Apostle Paul in Ephesians: “Therefore, I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and your love to all the saints” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87922" data-verses="Ephesians 1:15">v. 15</span>). Paul prayed for the saints because they had faith in the Lord and love toward the saints. Faith and love are crucial in our Christian life. Toward the Lord we must have faith and toward the saints we must have love. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87925" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">verse 3</span> Paul spoke of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, putting God and the Father together. But here he mentions them separately, saying, “the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, <span class="pg" data-page-id="122" id="122">[122]</span> the Father of glory.” In incarnation, the Lord Jesus Christ, God Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87926" data-verses="Philippians 2:6">Phil. 2:6</span>), became a man. As a man, He is related to God’s creation; therefore God the Creator is His God. The incarnation brought God the Creator into man, God’s creature. The title “the God of our Lord Jesus Christ” implies that God the Creator has come into man. Whenever we speak of God in this way, we imply that God is no longer merely the Creator outside of His creature, man, but that He has been brought into humanity. The Jews do not recognize that the Creator of the universe has come into man. They believe in Jehovah God only as the Creator and refuse to admit that God is the God of the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8rSFawMWiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> This title implies creation, incarnation, and redemption. God is the Creator; yet He is the God of Jesus Christ, who is God incarnate. Jesus Christ is not only God in creation, but also God in incarnation and redemption. In referring to God as the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, we are saying that we have been created, that the creating God has come into humanity, and that we have been redeemed. Incarnation indicates that we have the enjoyment of God. We enjoy God because He has come into humanity. Divinity becomes our enjoyment in Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxi-2sjnfAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87927" data-verses="Ephesians 1:17">1:17</span> Paul uses the term “the Father of glory.” Glory is God expressed. Hence, the Father of glory is God expressed through His many sons. The title “Father” implies regeneration, and the word “glory” implies expression. Therefore, the title “Father of glory” implies regeneration and expression. We have been regenerated by God, and we are His expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="MiS0T4a3KCiS0HGposEC8jSQrqKJEv0mQ1p8RXf91j3qhYPyaQ4vSp2OaxeR_yzEI"> In this one title, “the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,” five important things are implied: creation, incarnation, redemption, regeneration, and expression. We have already been regenerated but in the future we shall be glorified and express God’s glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87928" data-verses="Romans 8:30">Rom. 8:30</span>). The regeneration of many sons and the expression of God are the consummation of the divine economy. Before creation there was nothing in existence except God. God had neither generation nor expression. Then God created the universe and <span class="pg" data-page-id="123" id="123">[123]</span> everything in it. By His work of creation He became the Creator. After creation He took the step of incarnation, thereby coming into His creature, man. By incarnation the Creator and the creature became one. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was the uniting of God and man. Through crucifixion the Lord accomplished redemption. As a result, we, the fallen creatures, were redeemed. Then we were regenerated to become sons of God the Father so that we may express Him. On the day we are glorified, God will be fully expressed from within us. In this way we shall become His expression. All these important steps—creation, incarnation, redemption, regeneration, and expression—are implied by the title “the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory.” </p>
<p data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fBZRNPMTEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z"> Paul prayed to such a divine Person.

The Greek word rendered “revelation” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87929" data-verses="Ephesians 1:17">verse 17</span> means the opening of a veil.

<p data-content-id="TS0vLm3wTVrzuTUulNHSpsNOyUDe0c-25mTg4xYz74KQnIYS77RmuCw_eSmkzr8AS"> In order to have revelation, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation. The spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87930" data-verses="Ephesians 1:17">verse 17</span> must be our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. Such a spirit is given to us by God that we may have wisdom and revelation to know Him and His economy. Actually, the spirit in this verse is the mingled spirit, the regenerated human spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit. However, the emphasis is upon our regenerated spirit, not on the Holy Spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="124" id="124">[124]</span> </p>

Wisdom is in our spirit that we may know the mystery of God, and revelation is of God’s Spirit to show us the vision by opening the veil. We firstly have wisdom, the ability to understand spiritual things; then the Spirit of God reveals the spiritual things to our spiritual understanding. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4a3WoTDDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> Wisdom is different from cleverness and deeper than cleverness. It is possible to be very clever, yet not be wise. Cleverness is in the mind, but wisdom is mainly in our spirit. Our need is to be wise in our spirit, not to be clever in our mind. The problem with certain saints is that they are very clever in the mind, but lack wisdom in the spirit. There was a brother like this in Shanghai in 1933. He was a good business man, very clever at making money. In his business he sold women’s hats, especially to British women. One day a wealthy woman was not interested in a particular hat because she thought the price was too low. The brother went to the back of the shop, changed the ribbon on the hat, and doubled the price. At that price, the woman was happy to buy it. By this we see what a clever merchant this brother was. Although he was clever in business, he was lacking in wisdom and could not understand when we spoke about the Scriptures. His mind was very active, but his spirit was not keen. Nevertheless, this brother had a heart for the Lord, came to the meetings of the church, and trusted in us for everything concerning the Lord. He was an excellent example of the difference between cleverness and wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAzqpTlVjH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9"> Let us also give an example of one who had wisdom, but not much cleverness. In 1938 I visited the countryside in northern China, where most of the people had little education. Among them was a certain elderly sister. Although she was not educated, she was very wise concerning the things of the Lord. Whenever you spoke with her about the Lord, she was wise in her spirit. In talking about business this sister had no understanding, but in talking about the Lord she <span class="pg" data-page-id="125" id="125">[125]</span> knew much more than most saints because she had wisdom in the spirit. </p>

The Apostle Paul’s first prayer in the book of Ephesians is that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation in order to know certain things, the first of which is the hope of God’s calling. </p>

As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87946" data-verses="Ephesians 2:12">2:12</span> says, we were “apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.” But after being saved, we are no longer aliens having no hope; instead, we are full of hope. However, because many believers do not know what a hope is theirs, Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation in order to know the hope of God’s calling. </p>

<p data-content-id="od6p5sc1GDqOFwWB01GI4UN1FvyA7TvvTOTFDcnJar4LT8Qnqe8UcaKDTX05Qn6K7"> As God’s called people, we are full of hope. Firstly, our hope is Christ Himself. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87947" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">Colossians 1:27</span> says that Christ in us is the hope of glory. Moreover, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87948" data-verses="1Timothy 1:1">1 Timothy 1:1</span> speaks of Jesus Christ being our hope. Christ is not only our life and <span class="pg" data-page-id="130" id="130">[130]</span> holiness; He is also our hope. Our hope is singly and uniquely Christ. Every aspect of our hope is related to Him. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="a-sefdyyFRnPSiT6ZZ18VpqhiG9JQTLq-KbZep_8kFXpjCLum-lwALY397Cqj_hpR">B. The Rapture, the Transfiguration of Our Body,<br/>and Glorification</h2><p data-content-id="bx_UdsKHw-vHF3mnF2hC5zExpzAlAWM1-A9auvEbkRZG4a2E4SntYRIkifhdfEuRY"> The second aspect of our hope is the rapturous transfer from the earthly and physical realm to the heavenly spiritual sphere and glorification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87949" data-verses="Romans 8:23-25">Rom. 8:23-25</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87950" data-verses="Romans 8:30">30</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87951" data-verses="Philippians 3:21">Phil. 3:21</span>). The word “rapture” means ecstasy, to be beside ourselves with joy. To us Christians the rapture denotes being taken up. Bible teachers use this word to describe the taking up because, according to them, being taken up is a kind of ecstasy. However, I doubt that many Christians truly believe that their being taken up will be an ecstasy. Would you be happy if the Lord came today? Would you be in an ecstasy, or would you weep? Most Christians would either weep or be frightened. Although the rapture is an aspect of the hope of God’s calling, this hope depends upon whether or not we live by the Lord. If we live by Him and walk with Him, our being taken up will be ecstasy. But if we do not live by Him and walk with Him, I doubt that it will be ecstasy. </p>
<p data-content-id="qrCoreirL3MU0e6xc6vji8PZsGrIvz5zIOcWFV4v-HiHK0TVU2I9mwTIzwi4vYBpQ"> A great many Christians take this matter of the rapture in a loose way. Some hold the concept that no matter what they are doing or where they are, they will be raptured when the Lord comes back. But what if you are in a theater or are arguing with your wife or husband? Would rapture during such circumstances be an ecstasy? Certainly not! I would not want to be quarreling when the Lord Jesus comes back. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87952" data-verses="2Timothy 4:1">2 Timothy 4:1</span> Paul said to Timothy, “I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom.” This indicates that Timothy was to live in the light of the appearing of the Lord and in the kingdom. Whatever the kingdom will reject in the future must be rejected in our living today. I do not believe that many, even among us, are living in the appearing of the Lord. If we lived in His appearing, we would certainly refrain from quarreling; we would not want to be found arguing when the Lord appears. Not <span class="pg" data-page-id="131" id="131">[131]</span> many Christians regard the Lord’s coming as a warning. If you read the New Testament, especially the Epistles, you will see that the Apostles lived with the appearing of the Lord in view. The Lord’s appearing was constantly a warning to them and regulated their living. They did not dare to do certain things because they believed that the Lord could appear at any time. If we take seriously the matters of the Lord’s appearing and the kingdom, they will greatly affect our daily living. </p>
<p data-content-id="yso9Pxvovo30rgMfTrxdwDtMSBNZgZ3STh7ddBjVVV-UFyNUyESGMFZxFx7YtQwo0"> Many Christians, however, talk a great deal about the rapture and the Lord’s coming; but after their talk they indulge in worldly amusements. What a pitiful situation! Some Christians have been known to use the same table for gambling as for a gathering to study the Bible. Others have a discussion about the Lord’s coming, then go to sporting events, to the movies, or dancing. Have you seen that the appearing of Christ must be a basic factor in our daily living? We must live today in the light of the Lord’s appearing. If we do, our being taken up will be an ecstasy. </p>
<p data-content-id="8h6Q8qq7fu5OpgOocEN7CqtLsk5Cb-y1o55tduWJ4FjR4dq0idwixNOYWvRUriXAE"> After we are taken up, we shall stand before the judgment seat of Christ and settle our account with Him. At that time we shall have to deal with all our shortcomings, unfaithfulness, failures, and dishonesty. Many Christians have heaped up many such things in the course of their Christian life. When the Lord comes and they appear before the judgment seat, they certainly will not be full of joy. On the contrary, they will be terrified. We all need to reconsider our living. Many make excuses for themselves, especially for their weaknesses. Some say, “The Lord knows how weak we are, and He will be merciful with us. It doesn’t matter whether or not we fail or make mistakes. The Lord is merciful.” Others excuse themselves by saying that they do not want to be so spiritual or religious. When the Lord comes, however, there will be no excuses. Whether or not His coming will be an ecstasy depends upon our daily living. If we live a life of failure, defeat, dishonesty, unfaithfulness, and rebellion, the Lord’s coming will not be an ecstasy, but a judgment. We need to take heed to the Lord’s word to watch <span class="pg" data-page-id="132" id="132">[132]</span> and pray (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87953" data-verses="Luke 21:36">Luke 21:36</span>). If we are watchful, praying seekers of the Lord, His coming will be our ecstasy. This is our hope. </p>
<p data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUme1oJQzXNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0"> How much hope we have in the days to come depends upon our being built up today. If we are not built up in the Lord, we shall have very little hope. Christ is in us as the hope of glory, but even this hope is dependent upon how much we are built up. When Christ comes back, will He be your Judge or your Bridegroom? He may be a Bridegroom to others, but a Judge to you. If that is the case, as far as you are concerned, He will not be your hope of glory. Whether or not He is your hope in this respect depends upon the kind of Christian life you are living today. This is serious, and it should cause us to reconsider our ways. If our living is normal, Christ is our hope, and rapture will be an ecstasy. </p>
<p data-content-id="7_JcBoLt_f4p4TwS9GhdcDPud4eON0dHgTG9jncdwDuWZJuJ-gcIVOYb7Z2qhulnR"> At the time of rapture our body will be transfigured, and we shall be glorified. However, I say these things cautiously because of the deplorable situation among today’s Christians. By the Lord’s grace, we in the Lord’s recovery must come up to His standard and live the life that He requires. We need to be His living witnesses bearing a testimony for Him outside the camp. If we are like this, the returning Christ and our being taken up will be our hope. Furthermore, the transfiguration of our body and our glorification will also be a hope to us. </p>

If we lose our soul today for the Lord’s sake, suffering in our soul for His testimony, we have the hope of receiving the salvation of our soul at the Lord’s coming. Today our soul is suffering, but when He comes, He will bring our soul into His enjoyment. This is the salvation of the soul mentioned in 1 Peter. However, if we save our soul today, caring for its enjoyment instead of for the Lord’s testimony, the Lord’s coming back will be a loss and a judgment to our soul. But if we are always willing to lose our soul for His testimony, then His coming back will bring salvation to our soul, salvation that will usher our soul <span class="pg" data-page-id="133" id="133">[133]</span> into His enjoyment.

<p data-content-id="D20V42Q_F8EMHQVYOrygvO7B02Bnl4EAp5I6xaxu5BS3a8z8gUxLYQQk1sl7LSiAO"> Hope, glory, and power are all related to the blessings in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87970" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3-14">verses 3 through 14</span>, where five aspects of God’s well-speaking are covered: the Father’s selection, the Father’s predestination, the Son’s redemption, the Spirit’s sealing, and the Spirit’s pledging. The Father’s selection was that we should be holy, and His predestination was that we should become His sons. The Son’s redemption was that we may be headed up in Christ. The Spirit’s sealing is that we may be transformed into God’s image, fully saturated with Him in order to bear His appearance. Furthermore, the Spirit’s pledging is God’s pledging Himself into us as our enjoyment, taste, and guarantee. These are the contents of the Triune God’s well-speaking concerning us. </p>
<p data-content-id="S26jTFFVZnj955_hMlMnIhYo2MxpvdPkCD61VuHGKt4L3wCMJyIZ3UBt_LzbPLTVG"> The result of these blessings is hope. Our calling is the sum total of the spiritual blessings, and our hope is the issue of these blessings. This hope is also a glory. After mentioning the contents of God’s well-speaking, the Apostle Paul, out of the depths of his spiritual understanding, prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation and that the eyes of our heart would be enlightened. For this, our entire inner being must be dealt with. Our spirit must be <span class="pg" data-page-id="140" id="140">[140]</span> open, our conscience must be purified, our heart must be pure, our mind must be sober, our emotion must be loving, and our will must be submissive. When every part of our inner being has been dealt with, we can know the hope, the glory, and the power. Since the calling includes all of God’s blessings, the hope is the hope of these blessings. This hope is the glory of becoming holy. The glory is also the full sonship. When we arrive at full sonship, our body will be glorified, transfigured. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87971" data-verses="Romans 8:21">Romans 8:21</span>, all creation will enjoy the liberty of the glory of the sons of God. This glory is our hope. </p>
<p data-content-id="gBi8-OiEa7te_n7JZc2wVW68iMFexZhCfpqqsc2x3FtvD6W9167GIkeZns_JUH8SK"> We have seen that this glory has its riches, including all the items of God’s attributes and virtues. God is rich in attributes and virtues such as love, life, light, humility, righteousness, holiness, and long-suffering. When these are fully expressed in us, that expression will be the riches of God’s glory. Now we can see that hope and glory are the result of the five blessings, of the five items of God’s well-speaking concerning us. </p>
<p data-content-id="e7TeZuy6ip5trkTcKOr38frR-Dbfqup2tVAiVqlMGn0mLpxnTuxCJvbcyNlyALCaC"> The divine power is the unique means to fulfill this hope and to arrive at this glory. Although hope and glory may be somewhat objective, the surpassing greatness of God’s power toward us is very subjective and experiential. God’s power toward us is surpassingly great. We need to know this power and experience it. </p>
<p data-content-id="5tbeNC7n4bELsmeplIXgNzTilgwDSKoF26Q5SKhmn5Z95j36NkbT_ysCBWMthTXfH"> Twenty-five years ago, I conducted a thorough study of the book of Ephesians in Taipei. However, at that time I did not see that hope and glory are the result of God’s blessings and that they are accomplished by the divine power. Now I see that after mentioning the blessings of the Triune God related to us, Paul prayed that we would know the hope and glory of God’s blessings. Glory is the expression of God’s blessings. In His blessings God intends that we become His inheritance. In order to be God’s inheritance, we must inherit Him and enjoy Him. Firstly we inherit Him and then we become His inheritance. This is the result of God’s working of Himself into us to make us one with Him. Through God’s working in us, we become His satisfaction, and He <span class="pg" data-page-id="141" id="141">[141]</span> becomes our satisfaction. This mutual satisfaction is also a mutual inheritance, an inheritance that will have the glory that expresses all God is in His attributes and virtues. This will be the expression of the Triune God for eternity. This glory is our hope. </p>
<p data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bDbsOVJS0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D"> Now we come to the subjective matter of the fulfillment of this hope and glory by the divine power. Especially in this nuclear age, we are very conscious of the need of power to do everything. For example, it took power for man to land on the moon. Without power we are nothing. The power that fulfills our hope is the power spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87972" data-verses="Ephesians 3:20">3:20</span>, where Paul says that God is able to do exceeding abundantly above all we ask or think according to the power that works in us. The Greek word translated “works” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87973" data-verses="Ephesians 3:20">3:20</span> means operates. The English equivalent is energizes. The power within us not only works and operates; it energizes. Human language is not adequate to describe the surpassing greatness of this power. </p>

TOWARD THE BELIEVERS</h2><p data-content-id="TS0vLm3wTVrzuTUulNHSpsNOwUDS2c-25mTg4xYz74KQnIYS77RmuCw_eSmkzr8AS"> This power is toward the believers. It is like the electrical power that is continually being transmitted from the power plant to our building for our daily life. In the same principle, the divine power is being transmitted into us continually to make us the inheritance for the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose. </p>

This power has overcome death, the grave, and Hades, the place where the dead are held. Because of God’s resurrection power, death and Hades could not hold Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87975" data-verses="Acts 2:24">Acts 2:24</span>). </p>

God’s right hand, where Christ has been seated by the surpassingly great power of God, is the most honorable place, the place with supreme authority. The heavenlies refers not only to the third heaven, the highest place in the universe, where God dwells, but also to the state and atmosphere of the heavens, in which Christ was seated by God’s power. </p>
<p data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OMlZSXy2SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87977" data-verses="Ephesians 1:21">verse 21</span> Paul says that Christ has been seated above all rule, authority, power, and lordship and above every name that is named. Rule refers to the highest office; authority, to every kind of official power (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87978" data-verses="Matthew 8:9">Matt. 8:9</span>); power, to the mere might of authority; and lordship, to the preeminence which power establishes. The authorities here include not only the angelic, heavenly authorities, good or bad, but also the human, earthly ones. The ascended Christ has been seated far above all rule, authority, power, and lordship in the entire universe. Every name that is named refers not only to titles of honor, but also to everything that has a name. Christ has been seated far above everything, both in this age and in the coming age. <span class="pg" data-page-id="143" id="143">[143]</span> </p>

For Christ to be far above all is one thing; for all things to be subjected under His feet is another. The former is Christ’s transcendency; the latter is the subjection of all things to Him. Here we see the subduing power, the power to subdue all things. </p>

According to the context, to have the full knowledge of God means to know the hope of God’s calling, the glory of God’s inheritance among the saints, and the surpassing greatness of God’s power toward us who believe. To know God is to know the hope, the glory, and the power, for God Himself is in the hope, glory, and power. If we claim to know God without knowing these three things, then we know God merely in an objective way, not in an experiential way. But to know God in the hope, the glory, and the power is to know Him experientially and subjectively. </p>
<p data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fBZSNPdcEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z"> Most Christians today know God objectively, in the way of mere knowledge. To them, God is far away in the heavens. They know God as the object of their belief and worship, but they do not know Him subjectively as their hope, glory, and power. They do not know Him as the One operating within them to make them holy, to constitute them the sons of God, and to cause them to become the inheritance of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="inTRR5aqA6f3Zp0g5VCt5vC4jxBxYPP9fz0SGMS6TD8Ev1RYK0XGG-yq2bZI5h3Uz">BECOMING GOD’S INHERITANCE</h2><p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQkfI9Wmddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> We have pointed out that God’s calling is the sum total of His well-speaking concerning us. In God’s well-speaking we are made holy, we are constituted the sons of God, and we become God’s inheritance. Therefore, we shall be a treasure worthy of becoming God’s inheritance. God is so high, so great, and exceedingly precious. Nevertheless, He will receive us as His inheritance. However, if we look at our <span class="pg" data-page-id="148" id="148">[148]</span> present condition, we shall realize that we are not worthy to be His inheritance. But God will work within us to make us worthy, precious, and valuable, a unique treasure in the universe as an inheritance for Him. God considers us, His chosen people, His peculiar possession. The only way we can become God’s treasure, His peculiar possession, is by the divine working in us. God is the treasure, and He is working Himself as the treasure into us that we may become a treasure to Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bDbtOVsY0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D">THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2><p data-content-id="jzy56D5a4K14njv2OL9Qfpno83HGC1Ab9R3e21WSu1YH0DQn4sk-OuELvP5dRJ2jv"> We have seen that three important aspects of God’s well-speaking are that we shall be made holy, that we shall be constituted the sons of God, and that we shall become God’s inheritance. These three aspects are seen in the New Jerusalem. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87990" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span>, the New Jerusalem will be a holy city, a city in which God’s holiness is seen. Also, the New Jerusalem will be a composition of the sons of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87991" data-verses="Revelation 21:7">Revelation 21:7</span> says that he who overcomes will inherit all things and be God’s son. This indicates that the New Jerusalem is the totality of the divine sonship. Furthermore, the New Jerusalem will be a treasure, an inheritance, both to God and to us. In the New Jerusalem God will enjoy us as His treasure, and we shall enjoy Him as our treasure. Therefore, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual inheritance and a mutual satisfaction for God and man. The New Jerusalem will be the embodiment of holiness, a composition of the sons of God, and a mutual inheritance for God and man. Moreover, the New Jerusalem will have the glory of God, which is the glory of God’s inheritance, the riches of the glory of His inheritance among the saints. Today this glory is our hope. </p>

Fundamental Christianity has little power. Neither does Pentecostal Christianity have the proper power. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87992" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span> speaks of the power that is toward <span class="pg" data-page-id="149" id="149">[149]</span> us who believe. As those who believe in the Lord Jesus and in the Bible, we can all proclaim, “Hallelujah, I believe! I believe in the Lord Jesus and I believe in the Word of God.” We do not need to fast and pray in order to receive the divine power, for this power is toward us who believe. By believing we are positioned and qualified to receive the power of God. Hallelujah, this power is toward us who believe! </p>
<p data-content-id="rzBtTvnnp8EWQ9SXyt4WJFpGLK0wYN18pC-iFM-wWF7biwez5fLvQHeKFo4_b1dI7"> Electricity is an excellent illustration of this. When we built our meeting hall in Anaheim, electricity was installed. Now electrical power is toward the building. It is up to us whether or not we use this power, and we use it by turning on the switch. Likewise, the heavenly electricity has been installed in us, and the heavenly power is toward us. The way to receive this power is not to fast and pray for several days; it is simply to use the switch. One way to practice using the switch is to speak <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87993" data-verses="Ephesians 1:19-23">Ephesians 1:19-23</span> again and again. If we speak these verses ten times, we shall be empowered. However, if you repeatedly say that you are weak, you will in fact be weak. But by speaking positively in faith, we exercise our whole being to receive the divine power. When we speak in faith and receive the power, all negative things flee away. Satan is not afraid of our pitiful, begging prayers, but he is afraid of our speaking in faith. We need to say, “I believe, I speak, I have the power, I am strong.” This is not superstition; it is our Christian faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="dvx25G8sssSYMALmWN9v-wwDE3yApwN7G3_YIZuDLoUsHACVRNy6oYa6xgCQFEpxU"> Regarding faith, there must first be the fact. God comes in to tell us about the fact, and then we believe what God says. Our Christian believing is exactly like this. Although we cannot see it, it is a fact that Christ has resurrected from among the dead and has been seated in the heavens far above all. Furthermore, it is a fact that all things have been subjected under His feet and that He is the Head over all things to the church. These are accomplished facts in the universe. Through His holy Word God comes in to tell us of these facts. Then we believe what God has spoken and speak whatever God speaks. This is faith. We should not only read and study the Bible, but also speak the Bible. Some condemn <span class="pg" data-page-id="150" id="150">[150]</span> us for repeating the verses of the Bible, but we would only repeat them more. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9PvVFU7TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> In this universe a transmission is taking place from the Lord in the heavens to the church. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87994" data-verses="Ephesians 1:19">Ephesians 1:19</span> says that this transmission is “toward us who believe.” Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87995" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22">1:22</span> says, “And He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church.” The little word “to” indicates a transmission. The power that is toward us is the Triune God. This power is not only the creating power, but the power that has passed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. After all these steps, the Triune God comes to us as such a power. Within this power, therefore, there is the power of creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Hence, it is an all-inclusive power. The power toward us who believe is the Triune God, the Creator of the universe, who became incarnated, passed through crucifixion, entered into resurrection and ascension, and has come down to us. This power has been installed in us, just as electricity is installed in a building. </p>
<p data-content-id="KinSpiWncXMNo5T64K5GnF2nkvJMOAmz0SWiBllAApDxAJJy3NRnyUU_zHhMXOBI9"> We need to believe that this power is now right within us. Many of us, however, are too natural and too logical and say, “How could such a power be in me? I realize that I have repented, that I have confessed my sins to God, and that I believe in Him and trust Him. I can understand that God has saved me, forgiven me, and cleansed me with the precious blood of Christ. But at the moment I believed I did not feel that divine power was installed in me. Do you mean to say that an all-inclusive power, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit with the creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, has been wrought into me? I simply don’t feel that I have such a power. It is not logical to say that I have it.” Logic is always opposed to faith, and faith is opposed to logic. In this matter of the transmission of divine power, do not try to be so logical. Instead, exercise faith. </p>

Even those of us in the church life do not know fully what is taking place between Christ and the church. Since the day of Pentecost a transmission has been going on. </p>

According to our thinking, we consider that certain things take place once for all. Take, for example, the matter of being crucified with Christ. Those who emphasize the objective teachings of the Bible claim that our crucifixion with Christ took place once for all. In a sense I agree, because Christ died once and does not need to die again. Furthermore, He has been resurrected once for all and does not need to be resurrected again. Whatever He accomplished for us, He accomplished once for all. However, the application of what He has done is not once for all. Rather, it is still continuing. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88002" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>, it seems that Paul’s co-crucifixion with Christ happened once for all. But according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88003" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">2 Corinthians 4</span> he was continually under the death of Christ. Therefore, on the one hand, Christ’s death is once for all; but on the other hand, it is a matter that continues throughout our Christian life. In like manner, the power that operated in Christ in raising Him from the dead, in seating Him at the right hand of God in the heavenlies, in subjecting all things under His feet, and in giving Him to be Head over all things operated once for <span class="pg" data-page-id="156" id="156">[156]</span> all. Nevertheless, Christ is Head over all things to the church, and the surpassing greatness of the power that operated in Him is toward us who believe. The divine power is not transmitted to the church once for all; on the contrary, it is transmitted continually. </p>
<p data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6o17Pd8vLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9"> This transmission began on the day of Pentecost, and it is still continuing today. Even now this transmission is to the church. Electricity was installed in our meeting hall once for all, but now electricity is being transmitted into the building continually. Likewise, all that Christ has accomplished as the Head is continually being transmitted to His Body. The divine power will continue to be transmitted to the church for eternity; it will never cease. </p>

This talk has troubled me very much, for I realize that people simply do not know what they are talking about. What they mean by Body ministry is having several preachers instead of one. The Body is not an organization; it is an organism constituted of all the regenerated believers for the expression and activities of the Head. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5eq0ryI9O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6"> The Body is the issue of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ who has descended to the church. According to our natural life, we are not qualified to be part of the Body. On the contrary, we are qualified only to be terminated and buried so that we can be resurrected. By nature, not even our spirit is qualified to be part of Christ. Before Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection, the Body of Christ was not in existence. He had a number of followers, but He did not have the Body. The Body of Christ could not come forth from the incarnated Christ until He had been crucified to terminate the flesh, the natural man, and the entire old creation. After terminating all these things through His crucifixion, Christ entered into resurrection to germinate something new. Therefore, it was after His resurrection that the Body of Christ came into being. In our <span class="pg" data-page-id="157" id="157">[157]</span> natural life and in the old creation, we are not the Body. But we are the Body in the new creation germinated by Christ’s resurrection life. </p>
<p data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6o17PdlkLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9"> By incarnation God the Creator became a man named Jesus. Although God was living, moving, and acting in Jesus, there was no way to have the Body, for at that time Jesus was not the Head. Only after He had ascended into the heavens did God give Him to be the Head over all things to the church. By Christ’s all-inclusive death, the old creation, including our old man, our flesh, and our natural being, was terminated. After crucifixion, Christ brought the old creation with Him into the tomb and buried it there. When He entered into resurrection with the new creation, He left the old creation in the tomb. Then He ascended to the heavens and was given to be the Head over all things. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZF7iQ7T0lQJP8gtIC7nMKHR2tLd4EgK5Boj8tqPtmmD8KvxV6FuuLU1d_HGholgwP"> It took tremendous power to send a spacecraft from the earth to the moon. But how much greater was the power required to cause Christ to ascend from the earth to the third heaven! It was the surpassing greatness of God’s power that raised Christ from among the dead, seated Him at God’s right hand in the heavenlies, subdued all things under His feet, and gave Him to be the Head over all things to the church. Now this power is being transmitted to the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OMrZSbw2SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH"> As we pointed out, on the day of Pentecost, the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, who was given to be Head over all things, began to transmit all that He had accomplished, attained, and obtained to the church. Since that day, this transmission has not ceased. This indicates that this transmission has a beginning but that it has no ending. After all the wonderful steps taken by the Triune God—creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension—He came into the church with all His accomplishments. Thus, the church, the Body, is an entity altogether in resurrection and ascension with both the natural elements and the old creation terminated. The Body, an organism in resurrection and ascension, is wholly in the new creation and has nothing to do with the old creation. If you still live according to the old man, the natural man, or the <span class="pg" data-page-id="158" id="158">[158]</span> flesh, you are not part of the Body. Every part of the Body is of the new creation. Many who talk about the Body and the Body ministry are natural and fleshly; they are not in resurrection. We all need to see that the Body came into existence when Christ ascended. Having ascended to the right hand of God, He continually transmits His attainments into the church. It is in this way that the church comes into existence. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2etUQK13ogmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg">TWO CREATIONS</h2><p data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiErlr6ji8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND"> With us who believe, there are two creations, the old creation and the new creation. We must admit that the old creation still remains with us. How I hate this remainder and desire to strip it off! Some Christians, however, are not troubled by the old creation; instead, they appreciate it. Do you truly hate the old creation, the flesh, and the natural man? I doubt it. If I rebuke you for being natural and fleshly, you will be offended. But if I praise you and tell you how nice and good you are, you will feel flattered. This is a strong proof that you still love the old man. If you hate your flesh and your natural man, it will not trouble you to be rebuked. On the contrary, you will be thankful. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="P5LAppNM9anuOY8qKFZGxca_8XKRBW6wXX1IPiDZBj9REBKOwCbu8774faHM2uakW">THE TRANSMISSION<br/>FROM THE ASCENDED CHRIST<br/>PRODUCING THE BODY</h2><p data-content-id="-xjGehvejCQlzalTuo32KU2faU9jSuPgtsH4FEYaUB1lCP61PJ3xPUdWBlbNL_kSt"> We have seen that the Body of Christ did not come into existence before Christ’s crucifixion, but after His ascension, when something from the ascended Christ was transfused into the believers. This means that the transmission of the ascended Christ produces the Body. Everything we speak in the church life, in the ministry, or in fellowship must issue from this transmission. If our speaking is of the transmission, then our speaking is of the Body. If it is not of the transmission, it is not of the Body. In the Body there is nothing natural, nothing of the flesh, and nothing of the old creation. We all need to see this vision. We need to read these verses again and again until light shines on us <span class="pg" data-page-id="159" id="159">[159]</span> concerning this. When we see the vision, we shall say, “Surely the Body is nothing of the natural man. The Body comes from the transmission of the ascended Christ.” Praise the Lord that in the church life the heavenly transmission is taking place in us all! </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="-xjGehvejCQlzalTuo32KU2fbU9qfuPgtsH4FEYaUB1lCP61PJ3xPUdWBlbNL_kSt">THE TRIUNE GOD DISPENSED INTO US<br/>AND WROUGHT INTO OUR BEING</h1><p data-content-id="pUgU6yw7JGTUYrgFoe8JTp3eSQJSYv7TrTsP0dxOoJBaWmsdb5vA9y_VoOGAtYpSI"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88007" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span> begins with the well-speaking of God and ends with the Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. This indicates that the Body, the fullness of Christ, is the issue of God’s blessing. The words “to the church” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88008" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22">verse 22</span> mean a great deal. All that the Triune God has passed through, including incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, is transmitted to the church. The church has absolutely nothing to do with the old creation, which was terminated on the cross and buried with Christ in the tomb. What is transmitted to the church is altogether of the new creation. The church is the issue of this transmission. </p>
<p data-content-id="vNGdZHHY14iAb_v6HwIE3H6eHAnAWeE22cQi8F0_YUxRFUJ9ktsfg-XG_7irJOOpq"> This message is the concluding word on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88009" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span>. In this chapter there are seven crucial things requiring the same basic factor for their accomplishment: God’s selection that we may be made holy and without blemish (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88010" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4">v. 4</span>), God’s predestination that we may become His sons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88011" data-verses="Ephesians 1:5">v. 5</span>), the sealing of the Holy Spirit that we may be fully redeemed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88012" data-verses="Ephesians 1:13-14">vv. 13-14</span>), the hope of God’s calling, the glory of God’s inheritance in the saints (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88013" data-verses="Ephesians 1:18">v. 18</span>), the power that causes us to participate in Christ’s attainment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88014" data-verses="Ephesians 1:19-22">vv. 19-22</span>), and the Body that is the fullness of the all-filling Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88015" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">v. 23</span>). All these are accomplished by the Triune God dispensed into us and wrought into our being. The issue of such a divine dispensation into our humanity is the fullness of Him who fills all in all and the praise of His expressed glory. Actually, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88016" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> is a revelation of God’s marvelous and excellent economy beginning from His choosing of us in eternity and reaching <span class="pg" data-page-id="164" id="164">[164]</span> to the producing of the Body of Christ to express Himself for eternity. </p>
<p data-content-id="WMnpS5Obzk_YTS3q3GOFH1SNlAw0ErnZYpJ1P_jLUOjwyCSv5ZbC6HMtrIdmASj5I"> When you hear about the Triune God dispensed into us and wrought into our being, you may think that there is neither such a word nor such a thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88017" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span>. However, the Triune God certainly is revealed in this chapter. Although we cannot find the word “dispensed,” we do have the word “dispensation” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88018" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">v. 10</span>), which indicates the act of dispensing. Remember, the dispensation of the fullness of the times encompasses all the ages. The fact that we are sons of God shows that God has been dispensed into us. If God the Father has not been dispensed into us, how can we be His sons? We were predestinated by God the Father to become His sons. However, we became fallen and were constituted sinners. How can sinners become sons of God? The only way is to have God born into our being, that is, to be regenerated by God. To have God come into our being is a dispensing of God into us. By regenerating us, God dispensed Himself into us. Furthermore, we have pointed out that God is constituting us a treasure, a valuable and precious inheritance, by working Himself into us. Therefore, the basic concept of this chapter is the Triune God dispensed into us and wrought into our being. </p>
<p data-content-id="2dq7QF0hlVfHljch6uMOWbrE48vNgD7PM_en5LHupWopm5T9JM8tlnCWOoNUSQNy6"> If you do not grasp this thought, you will not be able to get into the depth of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88019" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span>. In reading this chapter we need to have the underlying and governing concept that God is dispensing Himself into us and working Himself into our being. When Paul wrote this portion of the Word, I believe that this thought was deep within him. Paul fully realized that God was dispensing Himself into His chosen ones and working Himself into them to make them holy, to constitute them the sons of God, and to cause them to become His precious inheritance. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="uRn6e8DCDhYvxWArZZyg1AAJaPa7lbWQ-S4ajELiYI6nagGr9Sjsomhlk1pMnAffa">I. IN GOD’S SELECTION</h2><p data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4agSmKxYcOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1"> Before the foundation of the world God selected us “that we should be holy and without blemish” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88020" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4">v. 4</span>). How can we be holy? Is it by following certain so-called holiness <span class="pg" data-page-id="165" id="165">[165]</span> teachings about matters such as clothing, make-up, and hairstyles? Certainly not! Holiness is the nature of God, and to be holy is to have the divine nature wrought into us. Without God’s nature in us, it is impossible for us to be holy. In order to be holy, we need to be saturated with the holy nature of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="4hu3V9NSxOD4qIDQx-aI8nybGXQAVHAukquOkznsExY9T1eCWD6YHuZmIvOhld_9j"> To be holy involves something more than separation. Some Christian teachers say that to be holy is to be separated; they argue against the concept that holiness is sinless perfection. The Lord Jesus said that the gold is sanctified by the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88021" data-verses="Matthew 23:17">Matt. 23:17</span>). Some teachers have used this as an illustration to prove that sanctification is a matter of separation, rather than a matter of sinless perfection. This is correct. But it covers only the positional aspect of sanctification; it does not touch the dispositional aspect revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88022" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span>. When God is dispensed into us and wrought into our being and we are saturated with Him, our disposition is sanctified. In this way we are made holy. Ultimately, the New Jerusalem will be a holy city. It will not only be separated from everything common, but it will also be thoroughly saturated with God. This is what it means to be holy. The fact that we have been chosen by God the Father to be holy indicates that God intends to come into our being and saturate it with His holy nature. Without His nature wrought into us, we cannot be holy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="od6p5sc1GDqOFwWB01GI4UN1JvyhwTvvTOTFDcnJar4LT8Qnqe8UcaKDTX05Qn6K7">II. IN GOD’S PREDESTINATION</h2><p data-content-id="3GEuFAt2o9byg8MZDzK996mX1fH3HXg_LkbTuP-LW2tuU3xrWTByUo7lMUOiCI2ZU"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88023" data-verses="Ephesians 1:5">Verse 5</span> says that God the Father predestinated us unto sonship. If the Father’s life has not come into us, how can we be His sons? Impossible! Sonship requires that we be saturated with the Father’s life. We are neither God’s sons-in-law nor His adopted sons; we are sons in God’s life and nature. Because we have been born of God and because God has been born into us, we have God in us. This implies that God the Father is working Himself into us. The only way we can be God’s sons is for Him to dispense Himself into us and then work Himself into us. Hallelujah, we are God’s sons, born of Him! <span class="pg" data-page-id="166" id="166">[166]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GJHsP88GHseo8rpjYyem_lGPbqQ164KrNMLYo1DtwblC8XXjSuatQl8WDTK_MeK3O">III. IN THE SEALING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="cUZm3R2OO3-xg87ohmxD-0kJRbXb4m8pa3KWJwuNiJOAyh8b5NcNgFoM_6ZG01679"> As believers, we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88024" data-verses="Ephesians 1:13">v. 13</span>). The Spirit is the Triune God reaching us. God in the heavens is the Father, but God coming to us is the Spirit. The Spirit is the seal of God. To be sealed with the Holy Spirit means that God has been dispensed into our being. We have pointed out that this seal is living and moving within us; the Spirit is constantly sealing us with God’s essence. To be sealed in this way is to be saturated with all that God is. Therefore, the sealing of the Holy Spirit also indicates that God is being wrought into us. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y7KPbnfhmVACkNVkC3njcSp5zkiFHRrpc5RUdAorxwk76X6_8r4-6ikKrq_X9AheN"> This subjective realization of the Spirit’s sealing is neglected by Christians today. Most Christians have objective teachings, but not the subjective experiences. Through the sealing of the Spirit, God is working His essence into our being. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="EkaMV3Soowz1Y1LdwSAggraExcxwo6M0H0MN5WrZ4ZYcDUwX2c921mm7c4iIL8IZY">IV. IN THE HOPE OF GOD’S CALLING</h2><p data-content-id="D20V42Q_F8EMHQVYOrygvO7B72B2o4EAp5I6xaxu5BS3a8z8gUxLYQQk1sl7LSiAO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88025" data-verses="Ephesians 1:18">Verse 18</span> speaks of the hope of God’s calling. One aspect of our hope is that we shall be transfigured and glorified with Christ. This transfiguration and glorification is the result of our being saturated with the Triune God. Unless God saturates our entire being, including our body, we cannot be glorified. This also refers to the dispensing of God into us. Once again we see that God is dispensing and working Himself into His chosen ones. This is the governing concept of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88026" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="S26jTFFVZnj955_hMlMnIhYo5Mx0tdPkCD61VuHGKt4L3wCMJyIZ3UBt_LzbPLTVG">V. IN THE GLORY OF GOD’S INHERITANCE<br/>IN THE SAINTS</h2><p data-content-id="gBi8-OiEa7te_n7JZc2wVW68tMFHyZhCfpqqsc2x3FtvD6W9167GIkeZns_JUH8SK"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88027" data-verses="Ephesians 1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span> also speaks of the riches of the glory of God’s inheritance in the saints. If God is not wrought into the saints, how can they ever become His inheritance, His peculiar possession? The saints become so precious to Him by being saturated with the divine essence. Only in this way can poor sinners become God’s special treasure. In this universe God is the only One who is precious. Now this precious God of matchless worth is working Himself into us to make <span class="pg" data-page-id="167" id="167">[167]</span> us His glorious inheritance. When the New Jerusalem comes, we shall see that it will be altogether a valuable inheritance, shining with God’s glory. Therefore, the fact that the saints are becoming God’s glorious inheritance, a precious treasure to Him, indicates that He is working Himself into us. </p>

We have seen that there is no mention of God’s mercy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88038" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> because everything there is excellent. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88039" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">chapter two</span> describes a miserable situation, a situation that requires the rich mercy of God. In this message we shall be concerned with the first three verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88040" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">chapter two</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="ziHhFbwj9qduVCwT62zA_ZS-mUWUCVUD31ttVpb1c14zDjDyuEyTtvwQz3ufe66GN"> Actually, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88041" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span> is not mainly concerned with the pitiful situation of fallen man, but with the producing and building of the church. At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88042" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span>, we see the church as the Body of Christ being produced out of the transmission of the ascended Christ. This is the church seen from the positive view, the view from the top. But we must see not only the view from the top, but also the view from the bottom. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88043" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> Paul looks at the church from the viewpoint of the heavenlies. From this perspective, the church is the issue of the transmission of the ascended Christ. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88044" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">chapter two</span> Paul looks at the church from the bottom, the church from the viewpoint of the miserable situation of fallen man. </p>

The last verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88047" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> reveals that the church, the Body of Christ, has been produced by Christ through His attainment. Now <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88048" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">chapter two</span> unveils the background, the realm of death, from which the church has been brought forth. </p>
<p data-content-id="qrCoreirL3MU0e6xc6vji8PVpGrtnz5zIOcWFV4v-HiHK0TVU2I9mwTIzwi4vYBpQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88049" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> the Apostle Paul speaks many excellent things. He says that the church comes into being through <span class="pg" data-page-id="172" id="172">[172]</span> the wonderful transmission of the ascended Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88050" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> Paul talks about Christ and the power that operated in Christ in raising Him from the dead, in seating Him in the heavenlies far above all, in subjecting all things under His feet, and in giving Him to be the Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. But as we have pointed out, there is another side to the church. There is the side of Christ, and there is also the side of ourselves. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88051" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">2:1</span> Paul says, “And you.” The church has not only the aspect of divinity, but also the aspect of humanity. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88052" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> we see that the church is the issue of divinity transmitted into us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88053" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">chapter two</span> we see that the church comes out of humanity. The conjunction “and” at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88054" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">2:1</span> is significant in bringing together these two aspects of the church. </p>

<p data-content-id="vNGdZHHY14iAb_v6HwIE3H6SOAnRdeE22cQi8F0_YUxRFUJ9ktsfg-XG_7irJOOpq"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88055" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Verse 1</span> says that we were dead in our offenses and sins. The words “being dead” refer to the dead condition of our spirit, a death that pervades our entire being. We were not only fallen and sinful; we were dead. </p>
<p data-content-id="WMnpS5Obzk_YTS3q3GOFH1SBsAwpMrnZYpJ1P_jLUOjwyCSv5ZbC6HMtrIdmASj5I"> As I was preaching the gospel in Shanghai on New Year’s Day in 1947, I said to the people, “Friends, we Christian preachers must be honest and tell people what their real situation is. You are not only sinners—all of you are dead. You are all in a coffin and in a tomb. You may regard yourselves as cultured ladies and gentlemen, but actually you are dead and buried in a tomb. I tell you this because now Christ wants to make you alive and raise you up out of your coffin.” This is a good way to preach the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="2dq7QF0hlVfHljch6uMOWbrIx8vUpD7PM_en5LHupWopm5T9JM8tlnCWOoNUSQNy6"> Because the book of Romans deals with sinners, it does not emphasize the fact that fallen people are dead. Instead, the emphasis in Romans is upon sins and sin. But the emphasis in the book of Ephesians is on death, on dealing with dead people. The salvation revealed in Romans is salvation according to righteousness. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88056" data-verses="Romans 1:16-17">Romans 1:16 and 17</span>, the gospel of God is powerful unto salvation because <span class="pg" data-page-id="173" id="173">[173]</span> God’s righteousness is revealed in it. In Romans God saves us by, through, and with His righteousness. In Ephesians, however, God saves the dead with life. Righteousness does not benefit the dead ones. What they need is life. Many Christians are not clear about the difference between salvation through righteousness and salvation through life. For this reason, they use Ephesians to illustrate salvation through righteousness. As sinners and dead people, we needed both righteousness and life, both the salvation in Romans and the salvation in Ephesians. </p>

Thereafter, whenever I visited someone’s home, I limited myself to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="174" id="174">[174]</span> room in which I had been asked to be seated. I did not presume to walk around in other parts of the house. To do that would be to overstep my rights and commit an offense.

The book of Ephesians does not consider us sinners as does the book of Romans; it considers us dead persons. As sinners we need God’s forgiveness and justification, as revealed in the book of Romans. But as dead persons we need to be made alive. Forgiveness and justification bring us back to God’s presence to enjoy His grace and participate in His life, whereas making us alive enables us, as the living members of the Body of Christ, to express Him. God made us alive by imparting His eternal life, which is Christ Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88070" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">Col. 3:4</span>), into our deadened spirit through His Spirit of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88071" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Rom. 8:2</span>).

Following this, God raised us up from the position of death. To be made alive is one thing, and to be raised up is another. Consider the story of the raising of Lazarus as an illustration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88074" data-verses="John 11:1">John 11</span>). The Lord firstly made him alive and then raised him up out of the tomb. In the same principle, God’s mercy firstly made us alive and then raised us up from the dead. </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8reAawMSiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88075" data-verses="Ephesians 2:6">Verse 6</span> says that we have been raised up together and seated together. From our standpoint we have been raised up from our position of death one by one. But in God’s view we were all raised up together, just as all the Israelites were raised up together from the death waters of the Red Sea (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88076" data-verses="Exodus 14:1">Exo. 14</span>). According to the book of Exodus, the entire <span class="pg" data-page-id="181" id="181">[181]</span> congregation of the children of Israel was saved at the same time, for they passed through the Red Sea together. This is a clear type showing that we were all saved together; we were all made alive and raised up at the same time. </p>
<p data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxiyzsjnbAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy"> Again I wish to point out that the salvation in Ephesians is different from the salvation in Romans. In Romans salvation is by God’s righteousness, but in Ephesians salvation is by the divine life. The salvation unfolded in Ephesians is not that which satisfies God’s righteous requirements. Rather, it is the salvation that imparts life into us to make us members of the Body of Christ so that God’s eternal purpose to have a living Body for the expression of Christ may be fulfilled. This purpose is fulfilled not by righteousness, but by life. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88077" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span> emphasizes that we have been made alive together with Christ. </p>

The third step of God’s salvation in life is to seat us together in the heavenlies. He not only raised us up from the position of death, but also seated us in the highest place in the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="inTRR5aqA6f3Zp0g5VCt5vC0lxBgSPP9fz0SGMS6TD8Ev1RYK0XGG-yq2bZI5h3Uz"> The heavenlies are the high position into which we have been saved in Christ. In the book of Romans, Christ as our righteousness has brought us into such a state that we may be acceptable to God. In the book of Ephesians, Christ as our life has saved us into such a position that we may be above all God’s enemies. The church people today are in the heavenlies. </p>
<p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQoZI9Dtddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> The word “heavenlies” is rather peculiar. It refers not only to a place, but also to an atmosphere with a certain nature and characteristic. God’s salvation by life has brought us into a heavenly place and into a heavenly atmosphere with a heavenly characteristic. When we meet together, we often have the deep sense that we are not in an earthly atmosphere, but in a heavenly atmosphere. However, if you go to a theater or some other worldly place, you will have the sense that you are immersed in an earthly <span class="pg" data-page-id="182" id="182">[182]</span> atmosphere. Because we are in a heavenly atmosphere with a heavenly nature and a heavenly characteristic, we are a heavenly people. God’s salvation has transferred us into such a realm and atmosphere. </p>

This was accomplished when Christ ascended to the heavens, and it was applied to us by the Spirit of Christ when we believed in Him. Today we realize and experience this reality in our spirit through faith in the accomplished fact. </p>
<p data-content-id="TS0vLm3wTVrzuTUulNHSpsNC3UDewc-25mTg4xYz74KQnIYS77RmuCw_eSmkzr8AS"> Both Romans and Ephesians indicate that we are in Christ. In Romans, however, to be transferred from Adam into Christ is primarily a matter of being placed into a justified position. However, in Ephesians to be in Christ is not only a matter of a heavenly position, but, even more important, a matter of life. Because we are in Christ, we have the vitality of life. In Romans Christ is the righteousness of God, but in Ephesians Christ is life. Therefore, according to Romans, to be in Christ means to be in a justified position; but according to Ephesians, to be in Christ means to have the vitality of life. </p>

Therefore, to be saved by grace means to be saved by having God dispensed into us. Most Christians regard grace as a thing, not as a person. To them, grace is merely a gift freely given to them. According to this concept of grace, we were sinners who did not deserve God’s salvation, but God saved us freely by giving us His unmerited favor. This, however, is a superficial understanding of what it means to be saved by grace. </p>

<p data-content-id="Y7KPbnfhmVACkNVkC3njcSp14kicIRrpc5RUdAorxwk76X6_8r4-6ikKrq_X9AheN"> The man God created to fulfill His purpose was pure, without sin or any kind of negative mixture. However, sin, the evil nature of Satan, entered into man through the fall. When the evil nature of Satan entered into man, it firstly caused man’s body to become the flesh, full of lusts, and eventually caused the whole being of man to become the flesh. In a very real sense, God created only the body of man, not the flesh. But when sin came into man’s body, the body was changed in nature and became the flesh. The body was the pure vessel created by God; the flesh is the corrupted body. God did not create the lusts in man’s body. The lusts came from sin. According to the Bible, eventually fallen man in his entirety became the flesh. Fallen people live according to the flesh, not according to the spirit, the conscience, or reason. Because in the eyes of God fallen man has become flesh, the Bible says, “By the works of law no flesh shall be justified before Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88103" data-verses="Romans 3:20">Rom. 3:20</span>). The word “flesh” in this <span class="pg" data-page-id="190" id="190">[190]</span> verse denotes a fallen person who lives according to the flesh and has become flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="EkaMV3Soowz1Y1LdwSAggraI6cxVk6M0H0MN5WrZ4ZYcDUwX2c921mm7c4iIL8IZY"> Because his whole being had become the flesh, man was damaged and thus prevented from fulfilling God’s purpose. Since mankind as a whole could not fulfill His purpose, God came in to call out of fallen mankind a race—Abraham and his descendants—for the accomplishment of His purpose. God then commanded Abraham and his descendants to be circumcised, that is, to put away the flesh. Thus, circumcision indicates that God’s chosen people must put aside their flesh. The fact that the called race was circumcised meant that they were separated from fallen mankind and delivered out of the fallen condition. Circumcision made a tremendous distinction between them and the rest of mankind. They are called the circumcision, those who are separated from the fallen situation. The rest of mankind are called the uncircumcision, those who remain in the fallen condition. Because Abraham and his descendants, the called race, were circumcised, those who remained in the fallen estate became the nations in the flesh, the Gentiles. We were in this category before we were in Christ. </p>

STRANGERS FROM THE COVENANTS<br/>OF THE PROMISE</h2><p data-content-id="qrCoreirL3MU0e6xc6vji8PVrGrIrz5zIOcWFV4v-HiHK0TVU2I9mwTIzwi4vYBpQ"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88107" data-verses="Ephesians 2:12">verse 12</span>, we were also “strangers from the covenants of the promise.” God’s covenants are His promises. His promise is His word that He will freely do certain things for His chosen people. Such a word of promise is not a demand, a requirement, or a rebuke. The basic thought regarding God’s promise is that it is His word. Apart from the word, there is no promise. </p>
<p data-content-id="yso9Pxvovo30rgMfTrxdwDtAVBNZkZ3STh7ddBjVVV-UFyNUyESGMFZxFx7YtQwo0"> Eventually, God’s promise became the binding covenant because it had been legalized by the necessary procedures. Both in the Old Testament and the New Testament God’s words of promise have been legalized to become a binding covenant. You may wonder what procedure was necessary to legalize God’s promise into a covenant. The best illustration concerns the death of the Lord Jesus for the forgiveness of our sins. The Lord promised that He would shed His blood on the cross so that we might receive the forgiveness of sins. The promise of forgiveness was legalized by the shedding of His blood. Through this procedure, His promise became a covenant. </p>
<p data-content-id="8h6Q8qq7fu5OpgOocEN7CqtHrk5CX-y1o55tduWJ4FjR4dq0idwixNOYWvRUriXAE"> No promise binds a person as much as a covenant does. Men can make promises without being bound very much by them. But once we pay the price for that promise to become a covenant, we are bound by the covenant we have made. The price is the procedure necessary to make the promise a covenant. <span class="pg" data-page-id="192" id="192">[192]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUmSyoJQ_XNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0"> All the words God spoke to His chosen people, from Abraham to Malachi, are His promises legalized to be His covenants. These words cover all the Old Testament from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88108" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span> to the end of the book of Malachi. Because these words have been legalized to be God’s covenant, the Old Testament is called a testament, which is another term for covenant. The whole Bible is a covenant, and the Old Testament is the old covenant. </p>
<p data-content-id="7_JcBoLt_f4p4TwS9GhdcDPia4eCL0dHgTG9jncdwDuWZJuJ-gcIVOYb7Z2qhulnR"> Before we believed in Christ, we, the Gentiles, were not only alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, but also strangers from these covenants of God’s promise. We have seen that the promise is God’s word, that the promise has become a binding covenant, and that all the words spoken by God to His people were legalized by Him into a covenant. Before we were saved, we were strangers from the covenant of God’s promise. </p>

All God’s blessings are contained in Christ; all the civil rights are related to the nation of Israel; and all good things are promised in God’s covenants. Since we were apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenant of God’s promise, we had no hope whatever. </p>

God is in Christ; He rules and moves in the commonwealth of Israel; and He bestows His blessings according to His covenants. When we were apart from Christ, the commonwealth of Israel, and the covenants of God’s promise, we were without God. We did not have God as our enjoyment. </p>

The commonwealth of Israel <span class="pg" data-page-id="193" id="193">[193]</span> was the kingdom of God, whereas the world is the kingdom of Satan. Before we were saved, we lived in the world, where we had no hope, no expectation, and no God for our enjoyment. That was the reason we pursued worldly entertainments. The worldly people today hunger after entertainment because they do not have God as their enjoyment. But now that we are in Christ, we have God as our enjoyment. How satisfying this enjoyment is! </p>
<p data-content-id="KinSpiWncXMNo5T64K5GnF2rhvJAMAmz0SWiBllAApDxAJJy3NRnyUU_zHhMXOBI9"> A number of years ago some of my unsaved friends asked me why I did not indulge in certain gambling games. I told them that I was busy enjoying the Bible and had no time for nor interest in such games. When I was asked why I did not go to movies, I replied that I had a heavenly movie theater, the church life, where I saw the heavenly vision. Because I have such a full enjoyment of God, there is no room in me for worldly entertainments. Today we are no longer in the world; we are in Christ, in the Spirit, and in the heavenlies. </p>

Through the blood of Christ we have been brought near both to God and to God’s people. Christ, who has accomplished full redemption for both Jewish and Gentile believers, is Himself our peace, our harmony, in that He made both one. Due to the fall of mankind and the call of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles. Through Christ’s redemption, this separation has been removed. Now the two are one in the redeeming Christ, who is the bond of oneness. </p>
<p data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxiyxsj-WAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy"> At present, there is still a separation between Israel and the rest of mankind. But according to God’s economy, this separation has already been removed. In the eyes of God, it was taken away by the redemption of Christ on the cross.

The Middle Wall of Partition<br/>Being the Law of the Commandments<br/>in Ordinances</h2>
<p data-content-id="MiS0T4a3KCiS0HGposEC8jScsqKJAv0mQ1p8RXf91j3qhYPyaQ4vSp2OaxeR_yzEI"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88125" data-verses="Ephesians 2:14">Verse 14</span> speaks of the middle wall of partition. This middle wall of partition is “the law of the commandments in <span class="pg" data-page-id="198" id="198">[198]</span> ordinances” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88126" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">v. 15</span>), which was given because of man’s flesh. The first of these ordinances was circumcision to cut off man’s flesh. Circumcision became the middle wall of partition because it made the main distinction between the Jews, the circumcision, and the Gentiles, the uncircumcision. Thus, the middle wall of partition, this distinction, became the enmity between the Jews and the Gentiles. </p>
<p data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fBVWNPMXEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z"> In the law of Moses there were two kinds of commandments: moral commandments, such as the commandments concerning stealing and the honoring of parents, and ritual commandments, such as the commandment concerning the keeping of the Sabbath. The commandments regarding circumcision and the eating regulations were ritual commandments, not moral commandments. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88127" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">Leviticus 11</span> there are a number of commandments dealing with eating. These commandments surely have nothing to do with morality. A person’s morality is not affected by whether or not he eats something that is regarded as unclean. </p>
<p data-content-id="inTRR5aqA6f3Zp0g5VCt5vC0nxBsQPP9fz0SGMS6TD8Ev1RYK0XGG-yq2bZI5h3Uz"> The three main ordinances in Judaism were circumcision, the keeping of the Sabbath, and the dietary regulations. Every Israelite male had to be circumcised on the eighth day. Furthermore, the Jews were required to keep the Sabbath and to observe numerous regulations concerning their diet. These ordinances were the three main columns supporting Judaism. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He broke down the column of Sabbath keeping. During the years of His ministry, He purposely broke the Sabbath by healing people on the Sabbath day. The Jews were very much offended by this. Then Peter took the lead to break the dietary regulations, although he did it in a rather weak way. Because he received the vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88128" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span>, Peter was forced to give up these regulations. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88129" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">Galatians 2</span>, Peter withdrew from eating with the Gentiles when certain men came down from Jerusalem. Nevertheless, through the breaking of the dietary regulations, another supporting column of Judaism was brought down. The Apostle Paul broke down the column of circumcision. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88130" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span> he even used a new derogatory term, the “concision,” to replace <span class="pg" data-page-id="199" id="199">[199]</span> the honorable term, “circumcision.” Furthermore, he referred to those of the circumcision as “dogs” and told the Philippians to “beware of dogs.” No wonder the Jews tried to kill him! In a sense he was even worse in their eyes than Jesus, for circumcision was the leading ordinance in Judaism; it meant more to them than the Sabbath or the dietary regulations. Therefore, through the work of the Apostle Paul, the remaining structure of Judaism collapsed. </p>
<p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQobI9Pvddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> We need to keep in mind the difference between moral laws and ritual laws. The moral laws will never be abolished, not in this age nor in the millennium nor in eternity. The ritual commandments, on the contrary, are not permanent. Whether a person is allowed to eat pork or is required to keep the Sabbath or practice circumcision depends upon the age in which he lives. Any Jewish male born after Abraham and before John the Baptist was obligated to practice circumcision. Likewise, the commandments regarding the Sabbath and diet were in force during a particular time. </p>
<p data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bDXpOVJW0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D"> By the middle wall of partition Paul meant the law of commandments in ordinances, the ritual commandments related to circumcision, the Sabbath, and diet. The law of ritual commandments was a middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles. As we shall see, any ordinance or ritual is a middle wall of partition. </p>
<p data-content-id="jzy56D5a4K14njv2OL9Qfpnk43HnN1Ab9R3e21WSu1YH0DQn4sk-OuELvP5dRJ2jv"> The ritual commandments were given firstly because of man’s flesh. Circumcision, for example, was required because man had become fleshly. Therefore, God commanded man to cut off the flesh. The ritual commandments concerning diet were given so that God’s chosen people would be careful to keep themselves clean. Animals that did not have cloven hoofs and that did not chew the cud were unclean. The cloven hoof symbolizes discernment in walking; it indicates that we should not walk in any place that is defiled. God’s people need to have a keen discernment in their daily walk. Furthermore, they need to learn to “chew the cud” by taking in God’s word and considering it again and again. Because fallen people do not have the necessary <span class="pg" data-page-id="200" id="200">[200]</span> discernment and do not consider God’s word, these commandments were given to God’s chosen people. However, these ordinances became the middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles. Moreover, this distinction and separation became the cause of enmity between the circumcision, the Jews, and the uncircumcision, the Gentiles. </p>
<p data-content-id="TS0vLm3wTVrzuTUulNHSpsNC1UDSyc-25mTg4xYz74KQnIYS77RmuCw_eSmkzr8AS"> Every ordinance creates enmity. In 1963 I was invited to speak at a meeting in Tyler, Texas. During the meeting, I began to say “Amen” in a very quiet way. Immediately someone warned me that the people in this country could not tolerate this. After that warning, I did not dare to utter “Amen.” If I insisted on doing so, a partition would have been erected, and enmity would have been created. </p>
<p data-content-id="nFupmXdU7v_F8Wz3VyT4gw6lMecWHqgfhZHMQs6SxdJFG3VrWN2G3kyhCMk9WVErP"> It is even possible for the practice of pray-reading to become a middle wall of partition and a source of enmity. Although you may find pray-reading very helpful, you should not insist on it if others do not agree. To do so is to cause separation and to create enmity. </p>
<p data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR0kbBZ2OWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB"> We must be careful not to bring any ordinances into the church life, for all ordinances kill. Some may prefer shouting in the meetings, and others may prefer silence. It is possible to make ordinances about either shouting or being silent. These ordinances cause not only division but enmity. I have witnessed the enmity created by such ordinances. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4WwWofJDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> In 1963 I went with some other brothers to visit a certain group in Los Angeles. In the meeting I simply did whatever the others did. Afterward a brother asked me how I could do this. I replied, “What was wrong with that practice? Was it sinful? Why would you not do it? Why do you insist upon being different from the other saints?” I did not personally care for some of the practices in that meeting, but I participated in them nonetheless in order to remove the middle wall of partition. </p>
<p data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAzmuTlVnH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9"> I had a similar experience in Manchuria in 1933. During my visit there, I was a guest one day in the home of some Japanese Christians. Like many young Chinese, I had been taught to dislike the Japanese because of the unfriendly <span class="pg" data-page-id="201" id="201">[201]</span> political relationship between China and Japan. However, when I entered this home, I took off my shoes and sat on the tatami, just as everyone else did. Surely there is nothing wrong with sitting on a tatami instead of on a chair. We cannot say that the one is right and that the other is wrong. The same is true with shouting in the meetings or with being silent. In the Bible there are verses that give place for both. </p>

This matter is extremely crucial in the New Testament, but it has been neglected by most Christians. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nFupmXdU7v_F8Wz3VyT4gw6lLecHKqgfhZHMQs6SxdJFG3VrWN2G3kyhCMk9WVErP">THE ABOLISHING OF THE ORDINANCES</h2><p data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR0kcBZrMWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB"> When Christ died on the cross, not only did He deal with sins, the old man, Satan, and the world; He also dealt with the ordinances. On the cross Christ abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances. Therefore, by His death on the cross, Christ dealt with five categories of things: sins, the old man, Satan, the world, and the ordinances. It seems that very few Christians today talk about Christ’s dealing with the ordinances, and I doubt that any books have been written on this subject. Most Christians think that all our problems concern sins, the old man, Satan, and the world. Many think that we are all right as long as these four things are dealt with. But not all the problems are solved, and we cannot be all right until the ordinances have been dealt with. The ordinances, the different ways of living and worshipping, had to be abolished by Christ on the cross so that He could create in Himself the one new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4W3WoGKDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> We have heard repeatedly that on the cross Christ accomplished redemption, destroyed the Devil, judged the world, and crucified the self. But perhaps you have never heard that Christ’s death on the cross was also for the creation of the one new man. In order to create the one new man, it was necessary for Christ to abolish the ordinances. By abolishing in His flesh the separating ordinances and by creating the Jewish and Gentile believers into one new man, Christ has made peace among all believers. The Jews and Gentiles were <span class="pg" data-page-id="206" id="206">[206]</span> separated to the uttermost by the ordinances. But both peoples were created in Christ with the divine essence into one new entity, which is a corporate man, the church. Because no other Christians speak about the abolishing of the ordinances and the creating of the new man, we are very burdened to give a word concerning these things. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAzmpTl8tH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9">THE HIGHEST ASPECT OF THE CHURCH</h2><p data-content-id="wZZd7ZXC7lqDMlD_3-HJuDfbR2iIDM5RxitkD5PpVOrwkpldqqeIgnRv2-Kvi2tyM"> Most believers recognize that the church is the <em>ekklesia,</em> the gathering or assembling of God’s called people. The Brethren emphasized this aspect of the church and even translated the Greek word <em>ekklesia</em> into “assembly,” which is an accurate rendering. This, however, is an even less than elementary understanding of the church. A somewhat more advanced concept of the church is that the church is God’s household or family. An even higher understanding of the church is to see that the church is the Body of Christ. The highest understanding of the church is that the church is the one new man. These four concepts of the church are like four levels in the educational system: kindergarten, elementary, high school, and college. We need to advance from the kindergarten level of the church, that of the assembly, to the college level, that of the one new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="8h6Q8qq7fu5OpgOocEN7CqtHtk5Cf-y1o55tduWJ4FjR4dq0idwixNOYWvRUriXAE"> The relationship among Christians in an assembly, a gathering, is not very close. It is much closer and more intimate among those in the family, the household. However, we are not only members of God’s family but also members of the Body of Christ, where the relationship among the members is still closer. Those in the assembly and the members of a family may be separated from one another, but the members of the Body cannot be separated from the Body unless they are amputated. Wherever the Body goes, the members must go also; they have no choice. However, in the one new man the fellowship is even more intimate than in the Body. The new man is corporate and universal. There are many believers, but there is only one new man in the universe. All the believers are components of this one corporate and universal new man. May the Lord show us more light <span class="pg" data-page-id="207" id="207">[207]</span> concerning the new man! We must admit that as yet we have not seen very much of this aspect of the church. The aspect of the church as the new man is a new discovery opened up in recent years. I believe that in the days to come the Lord will reveal more concerning the one new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUmS0oJQ3XNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0"> The family is more intimate than the assembly, the Body is much higher than the family, and the new man is higher than the Body. Thus, with the new man we come to the highest aspect of the church. Although Christian teachers have spoken a great deal about the assembly, the family, and the Body, hardly any have touched the matter of the one new man. This lack is evident in the deplorable translation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88136" data-verses="Ephesians 4:22">Ephesians 4:22</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88137" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">24</span> in the New American Standard Bible. Instead of using the word “man” in these two verses, this version says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88138" data-verses="Ephesians 4:22">verse 22</span> to “lay aside the old self” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88139" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">verse 24</span> to “put on the new self.” What a serious mistake this is in translation! The Revised Standard Version is also greatly in error by adopting the renderings, “put off your old nature” and “put on the new nature.” These errors came in because the translators responsible for them did not have the proper concept or knowledge. W. E. Vine, however, had some understanding of this matter. In his <em>Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words,</em> he says that the new man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88140" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">4:24</span> is the church because it is the very new man mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88141" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">2:15</span>. Because the new man is created of two peoples, the Jewish and Gentile believers, it must be a corporate entity. </p>
<p data-content-id="7_JcBoLt_f4p4TwS9GhdcDPic4eOJ0dHgTG9jncdwDuWZJuJ-gcIVOYb7Z2qhulnR"> The Lord has no way to accomplish His purpose until He has this new man on earth. The situation among today’s Christians is far short of God’s goal. Although there is much talk about the Body, not many have a proper understanding of the Body. Furthermore, Christians rarely even speak of the one new man. How crucial it is that this aspect of the church be fully recovered! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_gz5R_nH5oLy8-la4zwars7hTBAIZijurKKMBUDGJR9KRsTuy0qXMYueEupKE4DZW">GOD’S INTENTION TO HAVE A CORPORATE MAN</h2><p data-content-id="B77vULL4YXIHFFm6havIcY9pQVNW0oUVhHMvf-EO7Y7mN_8U3mz_Sb5pyhxZje63p"> In order to see the one new man, we need to have a proper understanding of the old man. Before exhorting us to put on the new man, Paul tells us to put off the old man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88142" data-verses="Ephesians 4:22">4:22</span>). After <span class="pg" data-page-id="208" id="208">[208]</span> creating heaven and earth, God created man, not merely as an individual but as a collective entity. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88143" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> speaks of man both in the singular and in the plural: “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion....” This reveals that God’s intention has always been to have one collective man. The corporate man created by God was damaged through the fall, and there is now the need for God to have a new man. In order to produce this new man, Christ had to deal not only with sin, the fallen nature of the old man, Satan, and the world, but as we have pointed out, He also had to abolish the ordinances. What most frustrates God from gaining the new man is ordinances. When Christ was crucified on the cross, our sins, our old man, Satan, and the world were not the only things crucified; all the ordinances were crucified also. The crucifixion of the ordinances was not for forgiveness, holiness, victory over Satan, or the imparting of life; rather, it was absolutely for the creation of the one new man. </p>

This verse says, “Having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace.” When Christ’s flesh was nailed to the cross, He abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances so that He might create the two, the Jews and Gentiles, in Himself into one new man.

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiEnor6yt8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND">CREATED AND RENEWED</h2><p data-content-id="P5LAppNM9anuOY8qKFZGxcazxXKMNW6wXX1IPiDZBj9REBKOwCbu8774faHM2uakW"> The way the New Testament speaks of the new man may sound strange to our natural mind. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88166" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">4:24</span>, the new man is created in righteousness and holiness of the truth, but according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88167" data-verses="Colossians 3:10">Colossians 3:10</span>, the new man is being renewed. How can the new man be both created, which has nothing to do with anything old, and renewed, which is related to something old? The creation of the new man is one thing, but the experience of the new man is another. From Christ’s side, the new man has already been created. But from our side, our experience, the new man is being renewed. According to the new creation, the new man has been completed by the work of Christ. But according to our experience, the new man is in the process of being renewed daily. My burden in this message is to point out how the new man is being renewed. This renewing is actually the putting on of the new man. As we pointed out in the previous message, the new man has been created, but now our need is to put him on in our experience. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-xjGehvejCQlzalTuo32KU2TXU96fuPgtsH4FEYaUB1lCP61PJ3xPUdWBlbNL_kSt">AN INWARD, SUBJECTIVE RENEWING</h2><p data-content-id="pUgU6yw7JGTUYrgFoe8JTp3SeQJiYv7TrTsP0dxOoJBaWmsdb5vA9y_VoOGAtYpSI"> The Greek word rendered “put on” is used with respect to clothing. Suppose a brother has a suit of clothes tailor-made for him. We may say that the suit has been completed. Now the brother must put on this suit in a proper way. He cannot put it on all at once; rather, it is a gradual, step-by-step procedure. <span class="pg" data-page-id="218" id="218">[218]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="vNGdZHHY14iAb_v6HwIE3H6SLAnwWeE22cQi8F0_YUxRFUJ9ktsfg-XG_7irJOOpq"> The putting on of a suit of clothes, however, is not a fully accurate picture of the putting on of the new man. The putting on of a suit is objective, whereas the putting on of the new man involves an inward renewing. We do not put on the new man in an outward, objective way. On the contrary, the putting on of the new man begins from within; it is related to an inward, subjective renewing. </p>
<p data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR0kdBZ2GWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB"> At the time of our regeneration, the new man was put into, or born into, our spirit. Now this new man must spread into every part of our being. This spreading of the new man is the putting on of the new man. It is also the renewing. By this we see that the putting on of the new man is not an outward, objective matter, but an inward, subjective experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4W2WofBDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> We have pointed out that on the cross Christ has slain the ordinances in order to produce the one new man in resurrection. Hence, in the resurrection of Christ, the new man was created and brought forth. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, the life-giving Spirit came into our spirit, bringing with Him the new man as a finished product. In this way the new man was born into our spirit. Therefore, since the time of our regeneration, the new man has been in our spirit. Now the new man must saturate every part of us. This spreading is both the putting on of the new man and the renewing. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88168" data-verses="Colossians 3:10">Colossians 3:10</span> says, we need to put on the new man, which is being renewed. How much of the new man we put on depends on how much we are renewed. </p>

Before you were saved, you had a certain manner of life. Perhaps you worked five days a week and then in the evenings or on the weekends amused yourself with certain worldly entertainments. To some, the manner of life may be gambling. To others, it may be going to certain places or eating certain foods. These are all part of the manner of life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="219" id="219">[219]</span> In every country of the world and among every people there is a characteristic manner of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5em5ryI5O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6"> If we truly desire to be renewed, we need to put off the former manner of life. By putting off our manner of life, we put off the old man in a practical way. To bury the former manner of life is virtually the same as burying the old man. Therefore, my burden in this message is not simply to encourage you to put off the old man; it is specifically to encourage you to put off your former manner of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6o52PdlgLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9"> Many of the saints in the Lord’s recovery still hold on to their old manner of life. Do not say that I am legal, conservative, or old-fashioned in telling you to put off your former manner of life. To have this attitude toward what I am saying here is a sign of being caught in the evil current of today’s satanic system. We should not be swept along by the current of this age; instead, we should bury our former manner of life and even hold a funeral for it. To speak merely of putting off the old man is too doctrinal. The actual putting off of the old man is the putting off of the former manner of life, which always involves ordinances and our way of living. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZF7iQ7T0lQJP8gtIC7nMKHR6gLd4AgK5Boj8tqPtmmD8KvxV6FuuLU1d_HGholgwP">NO DISTINCTIONS</h2><p data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OAmZSb02SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH"> Speaking of the new man, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88172" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">Colossians 3:11</span> says, “Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bondman, and freeman; but Christ is all things and in all” (Gk.). In his <em>Word Studies of the New Testament</em> Vincent says that in the Greek language the words rendered “cannot be” are very strong and mean that there is no possibility. In the new man there is no possibility for Greek and Jew, Barbarian and Scythian, bondman and freeman to exist, because the former manner of life found among these peoples has been put away. No doubt, in the church in Colosse there were people from all these backgrounds. Nevertheless, according to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88173" data-verses="Ephesians 4:22">Ephesians 4:22</span>, they all had to put away their former manner of life. By doing this they were renewed. <span class="pg" data-page-id="220" id="220">[220]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2etYdK13kgmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg"> If we consider today’s church life from the perspective of the putting away of the former manner of life, we shall have to admit that we have not adequately done this. On the contrary, too many of us are still holding on to our manner of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiEnor6ju8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND"> When Paul wrote the Epistle to the Colossians, there were Jews in virtually every city in the Mediterranean area. When the Jews and the Greeks in a particular city were saved, they came together as the church in that locality. In many localities there must have been not only Jews and Greeks but also Barbarians (northern Europeans) and Scythians, who, as some Bible teachers believe, were the most uncultured and barbarous of people. Therefore, in some cities it was possible for the church to include cultured Greeks, religious Jews, Barbarians, and uncultured Scythians. Furthermore, there were also bondmen, those who had been sold into slavery, and masters, those who owned slaves. What would happen if all these different peoples came together for the Lord’s table? In order for them to have the church life, they had to put off the old man embodied in their former manner of life. The Greeks had to put off their philosophy; the Jews, their religious observances and dietary regulations; the Scythians, their barbarous living; the masters, their attitude toward slaves; and the slaves, the manner of life peculiar to them. In the church life there is no room for such distinctions. There cannot be Jews and Gentiles, Barbarians and Scythians, bondmen and freemen. In the church life there is room only for Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="P5LAppNM9anuOY8qKFZGxcazxXKdHW6wXX1IPiDZBj9REBKOwCbu8774faHM2uakW"> Through modern means of transportation and communication, the peoples of the world have been brought together more closely today than at any other time in history. The United States in particular has been called a melting pot, a blend of all different races and peoples. People with completely different temperaments, some outwardly expressive and others silent and mysterious, are brought together. This certainly is true of the churches in the Lord’s recovery, where we see so many different peoples: Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Brazilians, Swiss, French, Germans, Swedes, <span class="pg" data-page-id="221" id="221">[221]</span> Danes, Indonesians, Malaysians, Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, Ghanians, and Americans. The difference between peoples is seen even in the way they sing hymns. Some may sing in what they regard as the dignified manner, barely moving their lips, whereas others may be filled with enthusiasm and exercise their whole body. Thus, even in singing and in praising the Lord we may hold on to our manner of life. </p>

This one Body, the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88182" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22-23">1:22-23</span>), is the one new man in the previous verse. It was in this Body that both the Jews and the Gentiles were reconciled to God through the cross. We, the believers, both Jews and Gentiles, were reconciled not only <em>for</em> the Body of Christ, but also <em>in</em> the Body of Christ. What a revelation here! We were reconciled to God; we were saved in the Body of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="ziHhFbwj9qduVCwT62zA_ZS-gUWkCVUD31ttVpb1c14zDjDyuEyTtvwQz3ufe66GN"> We usually regard reconciliation as an individual matter; we do not often think of corporate reconciliation.

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88183" data-verses="Colossians 3:15">Colossians 3:15</span>, we have even been called in the one Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9DuVFU_TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> This corporate concept pervades the New Testament. Our concept, however, is that we were reconciled to God as individuals. But in the eyes of God we have been called in one Body and reconciled to Him in the Body. The exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt is a clear picture of this. In Egypt the children of Israel were, in a sense, far off from God. After they were brought out of Egypt and passed through the Red Sea together, at Mount Sinai they were reconciled to God as one congregation, not as individuals. That was a type of our being reconciled to God in the one Body. We today need to have this corporate concept. Do not think that you have been saved individually. On the contrary, we were saved all together and reconciled to God in one Body. </p>

If we have the cross without the Spirit, we have the fact without the experience. Hence, the Spirit is crucial. Firstly, both the Jewish and Gentile believers were reconciled in one Body to God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88187" data-verses="Ephesians 2:16">v. 16</span>). That was a positional matter.

We have been reconciled to God positionally for salvation, and we have access unto the Father experientially for enjoyment.

As we come to these verses, we should not come with our natural concepts, religious understanding, or doctrinal preoccupations, all of which make us dull and insensitive in understanding the Word. Because the aspect of the church as the Body is not as high as that of the new man, we may think that the Body should be mentioned first. But how could there be the Body if there were not first a man? Firstly we speak about a man and then about the body of the man. The creation of the new man was primary, and the producing of the Body was secondary. Therefore, Paul firstly said that Christ’s death on the cross abolished in His flesh the ordinances in order to create in Himself the one new man. By doing this, the Body was produced. As soon as the man was created, the Body came into being. In this regard the word “and” at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88191" data-verses="Ephesians 2:16">verse 16</span> is significant; it connects the thought of reconciliation in the one Body with that of the creation of the one new man. When Christ created the two, <span class="pg" data-page-id="229" id="229">[229]</span> the Jews and the Gentiles, into one new man, He reconciled them in one Body to God. For this reason, Paul mentioned the new man before the Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="MiS0T4a3KCiS0HGposEC8jScpqKBAv0mQ1p8RXf91j3qhYPyaQ4vSp2OaxeR_yzEI"> Remember, Christ did not reconcile individuals. He reconciled two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles, in one Body. If He had merely reconciled individual sinners, He would not have needed to reconcile them in the Body. But in order to reconcile two collective peoples, He had to do so in the Body. </p>

Here we have the revelation of the building in two aspects, the universal aspect and the local aspect. Universally the church is uniquely one, and the church in a particular locality is locally one. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88201" data-verses="Ephesians 2:21">verse 21</span> we see the universal aspect of the church: “All the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88202" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">verse 22</span> we have the local aspect: “You also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.” Therefore, the holy temple refers to the universal aspect, and the dwelling place of God, to the local aspect. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUmS3oJB8XNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0">I. BUILT UPON THE FOUNDATION<br/>OF THE APOSTLES AND PROPHETS</h2><p data-content-id="7_JcBoLt_f4p4TwS9GhdcDPif4eTB0dHgTG9jncdwDuWZJuJ-gcIVOYb7Z2qhulnR"> As the Body of Christ, the church has been regenerated, and as the house of God, the church is being built. Apparently, growth and building are separate things. Actually, the building of the house is the growth of the Body. If the Body does not grow, the house cannot be built. </p>
<p data-content-id="_gz5R_nH5oLy8-la4zwars7hQBARQijurKKMBUDGJR9KRsTuy0qXMYueEupKE4DZW"> In considering the church as God’s building, we need to pay special attention to the foundation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88203" data-verses="Ephesians 2:20">Verse 20</span> says, “Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone.” Many Christians have difficulty understanding what the foundation is in this verse. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88204" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:11">First Corinthians 3:11</span> says, “For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.” Christ is the only foundation. Nevertheless, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88205" data-verses="Ephesians 2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span> speaks of the foundation of the apostles and <span class="pg" data-page-id="234" id="234">[234]</span> prophets. This does not mean, however, that the apostles and prophets themselves are the foundation. In contrast to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88206" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span> where the foundations are the very persons of the apostles, the foundation here is not the apostles and prophets themselves. Since the mystery of Christ has been revealed to the apostles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88207" data-verses="Ephesians 3:4-5">Eph. 3:4-5</span>), the revelation they received is considered the foundation upon which the church is built. This corresponds to the rock in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88208" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>, which is not only Christ Himself but also the revelation concerning Christ, upon which Christ will build His church. Therefore, the foundation of the apostles and prophets is the revelation they received regarding Christ and the church for the building of the church. The church is built upon this revelation. This is the meaning of the foundation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88209" data-verses="Ephesians 2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="B77vULL4YXIHFFm6havIcY9pTVNz6oUVhHMvf-EO7Y7mN_8U3mz_Sb5pyhxZje63p"> Upon what are we in the Lord’s recovery building the church? To say that we are building upon Christ is too vague and indefinite. We need to build the church upon the revelation received by the apostles and prophets. The so-called churches established according to nationalities are not built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Some so-called churches even exclude members of particular racial or ethnic groups. Surely those congregations are not built upon the foundation spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88210" data-verses="Ephesians 2:20">2:20</span>. The Roman Catholic Church and all the denominations claim that their foundation is Christ. However, none of these groups declares that their foundation is the foundation of the apostles and prophets. For example, the Presbyterian denomination is built upon the concept of presbytery. The apostles and prophets, however, never received a revelation that the presbytery should be the foundation of the church. The Methodist Church is built upon the principles of John Wesley, and the Catholic Church is built upon the concept of hierarchy. If the revelation given to the apostles and prophets were applied to the Catholic Church, the Catholic Church would collapse. The charismatic churches are built upon the foundation of certain charismatic gifts and experiences. In contrast to all these so-called churches, we in the Lord’s recovery must be <span class="pg" data-page-id="235" id="235">[235]</span> able to strongly affirm that the churches in the recovery are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. This means that the churches in the Lord’s recovery are built according to the revelation received by the apostles and prophets. This revelation embraces believers of all races and nationalities; it includes those who speak in tongues and those who do not. If you have the vision of the proper foundation of the church, you will realize that only the churches in the Lord’s recovery, not the Catholic Church, the denominations, nor the independent groups, are built upon the proper foundation. </p>

Here Christ is referred to, not as the foundation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88212" data-verses="Isaiah 28:16">Isa. 28:16</span>), but as the cornerstone, because the main concern here is not the foundation but the cornerstone that joins together the two main walls: the wall of the Jewish believers and the wall of the Gentile believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiEnqr6jm8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND"> When the Jewish builders rejected Christ, they rejected Him as the cornerstone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88213" data-verses="Acts 4:11">Acts 4:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88214" data-verses="1Peter 2:7">1 Pet. 2:7</span>), which joins the Gentiles to them for the building of God’s house. </p>
<p data-content-id="P5LAppNM9anuOY8qKFZGxcazzXKRFW6wXX1IPiDZBj9REBKOwCbu8774faHM2uakW"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88215" data-verses="Matthew 21:1">Matthew 21</span> the Lord Jesus indicated, in a figurative way, that the Pharisees would reject Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88216" data-verses="Matthew 21:42">Verse 42</span> says, “Have you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the cornerstone; this was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?” By this word the Lord revealed that after His resurrection He would become the cornerstone to join the Jews and the Gentiles. Referring to Christ, Peter said to the religionists in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88217" data-verses="Acts 4:11-12">Acts 4:11 and 12</span>, “This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” Peter’s word shows that salvation implies building. God’s intention in saving us is not to bring us into the heavens; rather, it is to join us to the Jews so that He may have His building. Many unbelieving Jews despise the Lord Jesus <span class="pg" data-page-id="236" id="236">[236]</span> because they do not want to be joined to the Gentiles. As long as a Jew does not believe in Christ, he may be separated from the Gentiles. But as soon as such a Jew believes in Him, he is joined by Christ, the cornerstone, to the Gentile believers. Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, we have been saved in order to be joined together in Christ for God’s building. </p>

It grows into a holy temple. The actual building of the church as the house of God is by the growth in life of the believers. Today the church is growing. However, it is not growing in our natural life, but in the divine life, the spiritual life. </p>
<p data-content-id="uRn6e8DCDhYvxWArZZyg1AAFUPaenbWQ-S4ajELiYI6nagGr9Sjsomhlk1pMnAffa"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88220" data-verses="Ephesians 2:21">Verse 21</span> also says that all the building is fitted together.

The Greek word rendered “temple” means the sanctuary, the inner part of the whole temple. It is in the Lord that the building is growing into a holy temple. This means that the entire building of God’s house as His sanctuary is in Christ the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="HfUkPNVdvPc-TGtNi_PIz-v411zmW3n27HnTj40Roiaxg_VGkAzUncYLNZiT2Ke0a"> At this point I would like to ask you a question: Has the temple of God in the universe been completed? The fact that the temple is still growing indicates that, from our point of view at least, the temple of God is not complete. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88222" data-verses="Ephesians 2:21">Verse 21 </span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="237" id="237">[237]</span> does not say that all the building has grown into a holy temple; it says that all the building is growing into a holy temple. </p>
<p data-content-id="XN29daXoEaiDc-NwR9H8WYCzOCQHQqlHCNZd9RwShWBkL98XRz-1aU8fWCfEcI9un"> The phrase “all the building” refers to the universal church. If you consider the past nineteen centuries of church history, you may find it difficult to see the growth of the building. But do not be disappointed. The purpose of God cannot be thwarted. The universal building is still growing. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88223" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">Matthew 16</span> the Lord Jesus prophesied that He would build His church. The building in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88224" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> is the very building in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88225" data-verses="Ephesians 2:21">Ephesians 2:21</span>. Although the growth of the building is slow and hardly noticeable, it is nonetheless taking place. </p>

In this parenthetical, beseeching word, the Apostle Paul described to the Gentile believers his ministry for them, a ministry which he received in the stewardship of grace through the revelation of the mystery of Christ. He also prayed in this parenthesis that the church might experience Christ to the fullest extent. </p>
<p data-content-id="ORuveXsLSL_KAUQRmmsRwUAnuxfYpsZhadewDeZFVr0RNBcjRKpEUgJ7ZofkxfD26"> In this message we shall consider the stewardship of the grace of God. Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88237" data-verses="Ephesians 3:2">3:2</span>, “If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you.” In Greek, the word rendered “stewardship” in this verse is the same word rendered “dispensation” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88238" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">1:10</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88239" data-verses="Ephesians 3:9">3:9</span>. The stewardship of the grace is the dispensing of the grace of God into God’s chosen people for the producing and building up of the church. Out of this stewardship comes the ministry of the apostle, who is a steward in God’s house, ministering Christ as God’s grace to God’s household. </p>
<p data-content-id="4hu3V9NSxOD4qIDQx-aI8nyXHXQdfHAukquOkznsExY9T1eCWD6YHuZmIvOhld_9j"> The Greek word translated “stewardship” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88240" data-verses="Ephesians 3:2">verse 2</span> is <em>oikonomia.</em> According to ancient usage, <em>oikonomia</em> denoted a stewardship, a dispensation, or an administration. At the time of Paul, many rich families had stewards whose responsibility was to distribute food and other necessities to members of the household. Our Father has a great family, a divine household. Because our Father has such vast riches, there is the need in His household for many stewards to dispense these riches to His children. This dispensing is the stewardship. Hence, a stewardship is a dispensation. The word “dispensation” here does not denote an age or means by which God deals with people; it refers to God’s dispensing of His riches into His chosen ones. This dispensation is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="242" id="242">[242]</span> stewardship with the dispensing ministry of the ministers of God. This ministry of dispensing is also God’s administration. Today God administrates by dispensing Himself into us. This stewardship, this dispensation, this administration, is God’s economy. In the New Testament economy of God there is the desperate need for the stewardship of grace. </p>

Apparently he was confined in a physical prison; actually he was imprisoned in Christ. On the basis of such a status, the status of his actual living as a prisoner in Christ, he besought the saints. In releasing the revelation of God’s mystery concerning the church in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88242" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">chapters one and two</span>, Paul spoke on the basis of his status as the apostle of Christ through the will of God. That status was the authority of his revelation concerning the church. In beseeching the saints to walk worthily of God’s calling, he spoke from his status as the prisoner of the Lord. His status as the apostle of Christ qualified him to release God’s revelation, whereas his status as the prisoner of the Lord demonstrated his walk in the Lord, by which he could inspire and beseech the saints to walk in the Lord as he did. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y7KPbnfhmVACkNVkC3njcSp1ykiFDRrpc5RUdAorxwk76X6_8r4-6ikKrq_X9AheN"> Paul considered himself the prisoner of Christ because he had been imprisoned by Christ. Later, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88243" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">4:1</span> he refers to himself as “the prisoner in the Lord.” Christ was Paul’s prison. One day, the very Christ whom you love will become your prison. Sooner or later, every steward of God, every minister of God’s riches, every faithful lover of Christ, will be imprisoned not only by Christ but also in Christ. The more <span class="pg" data-page-id="243" id="243">[243]</span> you love Him, the more you will be in Him. Eventually, you will be in Him to such an extent that He will become your prison. Once you are placed in this prison, you will not want to get out, because you will love this prison very much. Here you enjoy Christ to the uttermost. </p>
<p data-content-id="EkaMV3Soowz1Y1LdwSAggraIwcxws6M0H0MN5WrZ4ZYcDUwX2c921mm7c4iIL8IZY"> Everyone who loves the Bible has a high regard for the Epistle to the Ephesians. It would be a great loss for us not to have this book in the New Testament, for Ephesians contains the highest revelation in the Bible. This revelation was given to a man imprisoned in Christ, a man who enjoyed Christ as his prison. This indicates that in order to see something so heavenly and divine, we need to be a prisoner in the Lord. The more freedom we have, the more blind we are. But if Christ is our prison, our eyes will be opened to see the heavenly vision, and we shall receive the highest revelation. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="D20V42Q_F8EMHQVYOrygvO7N62B2s4EAp5I6xaxu5BS3a8z8gUxLYQQk1sl7LSiAO">B. On Behalf of the Saints</h2><p data-content-id="S26jTFFVZnj955_hMlMnIhYk4Mx0hdPkCD61VuHGKt4L3wCMJyIZ3UBt_LzbPLTVG"> Paul saw this vision on behalf of the saints, for as he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88244" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">3:1</span>, he was a prisoner on behalf of the Gentiles. If we enjoy Christ as our prison, we also shall see a vision not for ourselves, but for the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="gBi8-OiEa7te_n7JZc2wVW6wsMFH-ZhCfpqqsc2x3FtvD6W9167GIkeZns_JUH8SK"> Many Christians read Ephesians again and again without seeing the revelation contained in it because they are not imprisoned in Christ. They are too free, and their freedom makes them blind. But if you are willing to lose your freedom, the vision will come to you. Which do you prefer to have—the freedom or the vision? We all need to pray, “Lord, for the sake of the heavenly vision, I am willing to lose my freedom. Lord, I want to be imprisoned in You. Others may think that I am suffering, but when I am imprisoned in You, I enjoy You to the uttermost.” The enjoyment of being imprisoned in Christ enables us to receive the heavenly revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="e7TeZuy6ip5trkTcKOr38frdwDb6mup2tVAiVqlMGn0mLpxnTuxCJvbcyNlyALCaC"> No doubt, there are precious truths in all the books of the Bible. But the sweetest and deepest truths are in Ephesians. These truths are conveyed in heavenly utterances such as, “Be strengthened into the inner man,” “Are renewed in the spirit of the mind,” and “Be filled unto all the fullness of <span class="pg" data-page-id="244" id="244">[244]</span> God.” These heavenly expressions were uttered by one who saw a vision as a prisoner in Christ. While he was imprisoned in Christ, Paul saw what it was to be strengthened into the inner man, to be renewed in the spirit of the mind, and to be filled unto all the fullness of God. In principle, it is the same with us today. Whenever we enjoy freedom outside of Christ, we lose our spiritual sight. But if we are willing to abide in Christ as our prison, the vision will come, and our sight will be restored. The heavens will be open to us, and everything will become crystal clear. </p>
<p data-content-id="5tbeNC7n4bELsmeplIXgNzTurgwifKoF26Q5SKhmn5Z95j36NkbT_ysCBWMthTXfH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88245" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span> the Apostle Paul had a very high vision. It was in this chapter that he used the term “the unsearchable riches of Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88246" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">v. 8</span>). What Paul saw regarding this is far beyond our understanding. Not even Paul himself had words adequate to express it. Eventually, he could speak only of the breadth and length and depth and height (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88247" data-verses="Ephesians 3:18">v. 18</span>). These dimensions, which are the dimensions of Christ, are actually the dimensions of the universe. As he was confined and restricted in a prison, Paul had a vision of the universal dimensions of Christ. Although you may consider yourself a little brother or sister, you also will see something on behalf of the church if you are willing to be a prisoner in Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8reJawAUiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> The stewardship of the grace is the dispensing of the riches of Christ. According to the context of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88248" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">chapter three</span>, grace refers to the riches of Christ. When the riches of Christ are enjoyed by you, they become grace. Paul’s ministry was to dispense the riches of Christ as grace to the believers. A stewardess on an airplane dispenses food to the passengers; she does not dispense information on how to cook. Likewise, the Apostle Paul dispensed the riches of Christ to the saints. This is what we are doing in the ministry today. </p>

With <span class="pg" data-page-id="245" id="245">[245]</span> God it is a matter of economy; with us it is a matter of stewardship. All the saints, no matter how insignificant they may seem to be, have a stewardship according to God’s economy. This means that every saint can infuse Christ into others. Even a young sister in high school can dispense Christ into her classmates. This dispensing of Christ into others is the stewardship according to God’s economy. </p>

What Paul speaks regarding himself in this chapter is a pattern for one who would walk worthily of God’s calling. In order to walk worthily of God’s calling, we need to be a prisoner of the Lord, a steward, and a minister. As one imprisoned in Christ, Paul saw a heavenly vision. The more he saw of this vision, the more he experienced Christ and gained Christ. Paul was also a steward dispensing the riches of Christ to the members of the household of God. Furthermore, he was a faithful minister, one who ministered Christ to the members of the Body so that Christ might be expressed in the Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="gBi8-OiEa7te_n7JZc2wVW6wtMFWxZhCfpqqsc2x3FtvD6W9167GIkeZns_JUH8SK"> To walk worthily of God’s calling is not simply to be kind, humble, and loving. It is to be imprisoned, confined, in Christ, where we see the vision. By seeing this vision, we experience Christ, and Christ is wrought into our being to make us stewards to dispense the riches of Christ into others. We also become ministers dispensing the riches of Christ to the members of the Body so that the Body may be built up. We all need to be imprisoned in Christ so that we may experience Him more and minister more of Him to others. </p>
<p data-content-id="e7TeZuy6ip5trkTcKOr38frdxDbnqup2tVAiVqlMGn0mLpxnTuxCJvbcyNlyALCaC"> Having considered the stewardship of the grace in the previous message, we need now to see the revelation of the mystery. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88258" data-verses="Ephesians 3:3">Ephesians 3:3</span> says, “That by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I have written previously in brief.” God’s hidden purpose is the mystery, and the unveiling of this mystery is the revelation. To carry out this revelation is the apostle’s ministry for the producing of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="250" id="250">[250]</span> church. A revelation is an unveiling, the taking away of a veil. In the New Testament we have the revelation, the unveiling, of God’s economy. In other ages and generations this economy was a hidden mystery. It was not made known to Adam, to Abraham, to Moses, to David, or to Isaiah and the other prophets. If they had been asked what God’s economy is, they would have been unable to answer, for during their time the mystery was still veiled. God’s economy, the dispensing of Himself into man to produce a Body for His Son, had not been revealed to them. </p>
<p data-content-id="5tbeNC7n4bELsmeplIXgNzTuqgw7SKoF26Q5SKhmn5Z95j36NkbT_ysCBWMthTXfH"> The Son of God is the embodiment of God. God’s economy is to dispense Himself into a great number of human beings in order to produce a Body for this embodiment of Himself. This means that the Son of God as the embodiment of God requires a Body, an increase, an expansion. This expansion can be produced only by God’s dispensing of Himself into His chosen people. This is the greatest mystery in the universe. Although many political leaders and dignitaries know nothing about this great mystery, by God’s mercy we know what it is. Even the young sisters among us know what presidents and philosophers do not know. We know that God’s economy is to dispense Himself into His chosen people in order to produce the Body as the expansion of the Son of God for the full expression of God in the universe. Nothing is greater or more important than this. Praise the Lord that not only do we know what God’s economy is, but we are also in it! In fact, we even are it. We know it, we are in it, and we are it. By revelation this great mystery, which had been hidden until the coming of the Lord Jesus, has been unveiled to us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyF790iQXOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi">I. THE REVELATION<br/>TO THE APOSTLES AND PROPHETS</h2><p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyTzEtH1br2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> This mystery has been revealed to the apostles and prophets (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88259" data-verses="Ephesians 3:5">3:5</span>). Do you regard the apostles and prophets as outstanding people? The fact that the mystery has been revealed to them causes many to regard them as extraordinary. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88260" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">3:8</span> Paul, who was an apostle, referred to himself as “less than the least of all saints.” According to <span class="pg" data-page-id="251" id="251">[251]</span> Paul’s own word, the apostles and prophets were not extraordinary, for Paul said that he was less than we are. On the one hand, we may regard the apostles and prophets as extraordinary; but, on the other hand, we should consider them the same as we are. </p>
<p data-content-id="uRn6e8DCDhYvxWArZZyg1AAFaPaevbWQ-S4ajELiYI6nagGr9Sjsomhlk1pMnAffa"> Only in the book of Ephesians does Paul say that he was less than the least of all saints. Notice that he did not say here that he was less than the apostles, although in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88261" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:9">1 Corinthians 15:9</span> he did say that he was “the least of the apostles.” It is surely very significant that Paul inserted such a word into this section of Ephesians. If we did not have this verse, we would all be inclined to view the apostles as great men. Why did Paul mention this? It was because he was exhorting the believers to walk worthily of God’s calling. As he made this exhortation, he presented himself as an example, saying that he was less than the least of all saints. If Paul had not uttered this word, we might be tempted to excuse ourselves by saying that Paul, who was a great apostle, could have such a walk, but that we are not able to have it. By inserting this word, Paul gave no place for such an excuse. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88262" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">3:8</span> Paul seemed to be saying, “Saints, don’t think that I am greater than you. No, I am less. Since someone less than you can do this, then certainly you can do it also.” We should not make excuses for ourselves. If Paul could have this kind of grace, we all can have it. If Paul could live such a life and walk worthily of God’s calling, then we can also. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4agemKx5XOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1"> Many Christians think that only certain believers such as Peter are “saints.” They even speak of Saint So-and-so. But according to the writings of the Apostle Paul, all believers are saints. As saints, we are not inferior to Paul. We all can walk in the same way he did. </p>
<p data-content-id="IYKcWTBZD2wraBqVv8VOsOtHUdnZAu5Z92lk4lPzJmdAd2biN-nCndK5RLnSYtepK"> The meaning of the Greek word rendered “apostle” is a sent one. If you send me to Los Angeles for a certain purpose, I am your apostle, your sent one. In the Bible an apostle is someone sent by God. Although John the Baptist was sent by God, he should not be considered the first sent one in the New Testament economy, because his ministry was during a <span class="pg" data-page-id="252" id="252">[252]</span> transitional period. The first one sent by God in the New Testament economy was the Lord Jesus. Hence, He was the first Apostle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88263" data-verses="Hebrews 3:1">Heb. 3:1</span>). The Lord sent out the twelve Apostles. These twelve, however, were not the only sent ones. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88264" data-verses="John 20:21">John 20:21</span> the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, “As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.” This verse proves that all the disciples were sent ones. This means that every believer is a sent one. Even a young sister in junior high school is one sent to school by the Lord to minister Christ to her teachers and classmates. Likewise, if you are burdened for one of your relatives and the Lord sends you to him for the purpose of ministering Christ to him, are you not one sent by Christ? Yes, to your relatives you are Christ’s apostle. You may even be an apostle to those in your own family. One day the Lord may send you to your mother to share Christ with her. At such a time you are an apostle to your mother. Therefore, in a sense, we all are the Lord’s apostles, His sent ones. </p>
<p data-content-id="HfUkPNVdvPc-TGtNi_PIz-v471zqU3n27HnTj40Roiaxg_VGkAzUncYLNZiT2Ke0a"> In like manner, there is a sense in which all believers in Christ are prophets. Contrary to the concept of many Christians, a prophet is not primarily one who predicts the future; he is a spokesman for God. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88265" data-verses="Hebrews 3:1">Hebrews 3</span>, Moses, one called by God and sent to the children of Israel, was an apostle; he typified Christ as God’s Apostle. When the Lord called him and sent him out as an apostle, Moses was timid and claimed that he could not speak well. Then the Lord told Moses that He would give him his brother Aaron as a prophet. Aaron was given by God to Moses not to predict the future on behalf of Moses, but to be his spokesman. By this we see that the ministry of a prophet goes along with that of an apostle. Moses was the apostle, and Aaron was the prophet. </p>

As one with such a worthy walk, he was a prisoner, a steward, and a minister. In this chapter Paul told us that the revelation of the mystery concerning Christ for the church has been given to the apostles and prophets (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88280" data-verses="Ephesians 3:5">v. 5</span>). Paul’s revelation of Christ was mainly a revelation of Christ’s unsearchable riches. Because Paul’s walk was governed by his revelation of Christ, he could not keep from speaking of the riches of Christ. The apostle’s preaching was focused on the riches of Christ, not on the doctrines. The riches of Christ are what Christ is to us, such as light, life, righteousness, and holiness. These riches are unsearchable; it is beyond our ability to trace them out. Since we also can be apostles and prophets, there is the need for us to see the unsearchable riches of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQsYI9emddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> Many Christians have the mistaken concept that the apostles in the universal church and the elders in the local churches are high officials, far above the so-called laymen or common believers. As we pointed out in the foregoing message, the Apostle Paul, realizing that such was a wrong concept, purposely indicated that the apostles and prophets were not extraordinary. On the contrary, they should be regarded simply as leading ones among the saints in the churches. They take the lead to receive the revelation concerning Christ for the church, to live Christ, to experience Christ, to enjoy Christ, and to minister the riches of Christ to others. If the enjoyment of the riches of Christ were available only for certain exceptional persons of high rank, then <span class="pg" data-page-id="260" id="260">[260]</span> the rest of us would have no share in it. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88281" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">3:8</span> Paul said that he was less than the least of all saints; yet he could preach the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel. The fact that Paul could do this indicates that we can do it also. Because he was less than we are, what was available to him is available also to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bDTqOVUY0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D"> The apostles and prophets are not a special class of believers. Rather, they are ordinary believers like the rest of us. The difference between them and other believers is that they are leading ones. It is the same with the elders in the local churches. The elders are not extraordinary people of high rank, higher than other believers. No, they are simply those who take the lead in the church life. We all need to allow this concept to sink into our being. </p>
<p data-content-id="jzy56D5a4K14njv2OL9Qfpng73H-C1Ab9R3e21WSu1YH0DQn4sk-OuELvP5dRJ2jv"> In the Lord’s recovery we must drop the thought of rank. There is no rank among us. At most, we just have some leading ones to take the lead to live Christ for the church life. There is no higher class, no special class, in the church. We have no leader. According to the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88282" data-verses="Matthew 23:8-10">Matthew 23:8-10</span>, He is our unique Leader, and we all are brothers. We must drop the concept that the apostles and elders are special. We all are sheep, and the apostles, prophets, and elders take the lead to set an example, a pattern, of how to know Christ, to enjoy Him, to gain Him for the church life, and to dispense Him into others. This is a matter of setting an example, not a matter of rank or position. </p>

In Types</h2><p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyT3NtHUQr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> The riches of Christ are depicted in types. It is not easy to find all the types of Christ in the Old Testament. Some types are hidden. For example, the earth that emerges in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88283" data-verses="Genesis 1:9-10">Genesis 1:9 and 10</span> is a type of Christ. Many other types are <span class="pg" data-page-id="261" id="261">[261]</span> found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88284" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapter one</span> of Genesis: light, the sun, the star, and the trees. Elsewhere in the Bible we see that the vine tree, the apple tree, the cedar, and the cypress are all types of Christ. Herbs also typify Christ. At the time of the Passover, the children of Israel ate not only the lamb, but also unleavened bread and bitter herbs. Wheat and barley are also types of Christ, and the henna flower spoken of in Song of Songs as well. Certain persons also typify Christ. Adam, Abel, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron are some of these who are types of Christ. The priests, the kings, and the prophets also typify Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8raBawMWiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> The more I study the Bible, the more I realize how little I know it. A hundred messages could be given on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88285" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, mainly on the types of Christ in this chapter. The Bible is deep and profound. Only when we get into its depths do we see the riches it contains. Beneath the surface of the Bible are the riches of Christ. Because these riches are so vast, it is difficult for anyone to say how many types of Christ there are in the Old Testament. Just this one matter of the types reveals many of the riches of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxi2ysjnfAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy">B. In Shadows</h2><p data-content-id="MiS0T4a3KCiS0HGposEC8jSYvqKJEv0mQ1p8RXf91j3qhYPyaQ4vSp2OaxeR_yzEI"> Along with the types, there are the shadows and figures of Christ. Although types and shadows are similar in certain respects, they are like human faces in that they not only share similarities, but also differ from each other. Types are mainly persons or things that signify Christ, whereas shadows mainly refer to rituals and practices in the Old Testament that portray Christ. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88286" data-verses="Colossians 2:16-17">Colossians 2:16 and 17</span>, eating regulations, rituals, and holy days were shadows. By this we see that the laws, ordinances, and ceremonies in the Old Testament were shadows portraying Christ. But Adam, Aaron, and Moses were not shadows; they were types. The Sabbath day and the new moon, on the contrary, were shadows. Although the Sabbath was a rest, it was not the real rest, for the real rest is Christ. Likewise, the law as a testimony of God described what God was like. As a description and explanation of God, the law was a <span class="pg" data-page-id="262" id="262">[262]</span> testimony of God. In this it was a shadow of Christ as the real explanation, definition, and testimony of God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fBRVNPMTEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z">C. In Figures</h2><p data-content-id="inTRR5aqA6f3Zp0g5VCt5vCwkxBsUPP9fz0SGMS6TD8Ev1RYK0XGG-yq2bZI5h3Uz"> A figure mainly refers to a situation that presents a certain picture. For example, the wandering of the children of Israel in the wilderness is a figure, a picture, of our experience in the Christian life today, which is often a life of wandering. The Passover is another figure. Although the Passover lamb is a type of Christ, the Passover itself is a figure depicting how Christ, our Passover, saves us from God’s judgment and feeds us with what He is. Hence, the picture of the Passover is a figure of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQsYI9Prddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> Christ is so rich that He needs not only types, but also shadows and figures to portray Him. All the types, shadows, and figures of Christ in the Old Testament are descriptions, explanations, and definitions of what Christ is. We need to study all these matters in the Scriptures in order to know the riches of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bDTqOVJa0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D">D. In Prophecies</h2><p data-content-id="jzy56D5a4K14njv2OL9Qfpng73HnB1Ab9R3e21WSu1YH0DQn4sk-OuELvP5dRJ2jv"> The riches of Christ are also seen in prophecies. In the Bible the first prophecy concerning Christ is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88287" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>, a verse which predicts that Christ as the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent, Satan. This implies that Christ had to become a man born of a virgin, for He was to be the seed of woman. Christ is not the descendant of a man; He is the seed of a woman. This one verse reveals much of the riches of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="TS0vLm3wTVrzuTUulNHSpsNG2UDe0c-25mTg4xYz74KQnIYS77RmuCw_eSmkzr8AS"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88288" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span> is another prophecy regarding Christ. This verse gives us seven titles of Christ: Child, Son, Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. In the Old Testament, there are a great many other prophecies of Christ. Even the short book of Zechariah contains many detailed prophecies concerning Him. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="nFupmXdU7v_F8Wz3VyT4gw6hPecaBqgfhZHMQs6SxdJFG3VrWN2G3kyhCMk9WVErP">E. In Fulfillment</h2><p data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR0gYBZ6EWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB"> The riches of Christ are also seen in the fulfillment of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="263" id="263">[263]</span> prophecies. Sometimes in the fulfillment of a prophecy in the New Testament something further is added. For example, the Old Testament reveals that Christ will be the lamb. But in the Old Testament, Christ is never called the Lamb of God. Nevertheless, in the fulfillment of the prophecy regarding Christ as the lamb, He is called the Lamb of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88289" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>).

God is very wise, and the universe reveals His wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OEiZSC52SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH"> We need to see the difference between wisdom and knowledge. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88302" data-verses="Colossians 2:3">Colossians 2:3</span> the two are mentioned together. Wisdom is both higher and deeper than knowledge. Wisdom is seen in the initiation of something, for example, in the formulation of a new invention, and knowledge is seen in the practical application. If you have only knowledge and lack wisdom, you will not be able to initiate anything nor to invent anything. God is the unique Initiator. He has initiated many things, not by His knowledge, but by His wisdom. When He comes in to apply what He has initiated, He displays His knowledge. <span class="pg" data-page-id="268" id="268">[268]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2etcZK1SmgmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg"> In our case, wisdom is in our spirit, and knowledge is in our mind. If you do not know how to get into your spirit, you may have a great deal of knowledge, but you will not have any wisdom. But if you are a person in the spirit, you will be wise. Furthermore, in your mind you will have knowledge, prudence. </p>
<p data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiEjsr6Ct8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88303" data-verses="Ephesians 3:10">Verse 10</span> says that through the church the multifarious wisdom of God is made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies. These rulers and authorities are the angelic rulers and authorities, both good and evil. The passage here especially refers to the evil ones—Satan and his angels. According to the New Testament, Satan has his kingdom, his angels, and his sphere of rule. Satan’s sphere of rule is in the air and on the earth. The book of Daniel indicates that all nations on earth are under the rule of Satan in the air. Therefore, through the church God makes His wisdom known not mainly to human beings but to those rebellious angels who are the followers of God’s enemy. </p>
<p data-content-id="a-sefdyyFRnPSiT6ZZ18VpqpmG9JQTLq-KbZep_8kFXpjCLum-lwALY397Cqj_hpR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88304" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Verse 8</span> reveals that the church is produced from the unsearchable riches of Christ. When God’s chosen people partake of and enjoy the riches of Christ, these riches constitute them the church, through which God’s multifarious wisdom is made known to the angelic rulers and authorities in the heavenlies. Hence, the church is God’s wise exhibition of all that Christ is. </p>
<p data-content-id="bx_UdsKHw-vHF3mnF2hC5zE5tzAlAWM1-A9auvEbkRZG4a2E4SntYRIkifhdfEuRY"> Even the rebellion of Satan is within the realm of God’s wisdom. If it were not for Satan’s rebellion, God’s wisdom could not be made known in a full way. If you are a person full of wisdom, the more troubles and difficulties you have, the more wisdom you will express. But if everything related to you is peaceful and without problems, you will have no opportunity to express your wisdom. Actually, when everything is going well, there is little need of wisdom. You need trouble in order to display your wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="qrCoreirL3MU0e6xc6vji8PRoGrIvz5zIOcWFV4v-HiHK0TVU2I9mwTIzwi4vYBpQ"> God also needs trouble. He even needs an adversary, Satan. Few Christians realize that God actually needs Satan. Although God needs us, He needs Satan even more. When I was young, I wondered why God did not cast Satan <span class="pg" data-page-id="269" id="269">[269]</span> into the lake of fire immediately when he rebelled against Him. I questioned why God gave Satan so much freedom. I also asked why God put the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden of Eden. If this tree had not been there, man would not have fallen. But without Satan and without the tree of knowledge, God’s wisdom cannot be fully manifested. Satan and the tree of knowledge have created many opportunities for God’s wisdom to be manifested in a multifarious way, that is, in various ways and aspects and from many angles. The Greek word translated “multifarious” indicates that God’s wisdom has many sides, aspects, and directions. Only through problems can all the aspects of God’s wisdom be manifested. </p>
<p data-content-id="yso9Pxvovo30rgMfTrxdwDtEWBNZgZ3STh7ddBjVVV-UFyNUyESGMFZxFx7YtQwo0"> When some hear of such a word, they may be tempted to say, “Let us create more trouble for God. Let us do evil that good may come.” Never say this. If you intend to create trouble or to do evil, you may find yourself unable to do so. For example, although it is easy to stand up, it is difficult to fall purposely. We need to realize our nothingness. On our own, we cannot succeed either in being defeated or in being victorious. If you try not to be defeated, you may be defeated. But if you want to be defeated, you may find that you cannot be defeated. </p>
<p data-content-id="8h6Q8qq7fu5OpgOocEN7CqtDok5Cb-y1o55tduWJ4FjR4dq0idwixNOYWvRUriXAE"> Consider the example of David. With respect to Bath-sheba, David had a great failure. If God had not allowed him to fall in this matter, David could not have fallen. David’s fall gave God an opportunity to express His wisdom. Through David’s fall and repentance combined with God’s forgiveness, David gained a son, Solomon, to be the builder of the temple. Later, David fell again, this time in numbering the army of Israel. But through this second fall David acquired the site on which the temple was built. For the building of the temple there was the need for both the builder and the site. If you read the Bible with understanding, you will see that David’s falls were neither of David nor of God; they were of Satan. It was Satan who tempted David to commit immorality and to number the army of Israel. When David yielded to these temptations, Satan was <span class="pg" data-page-id="270" id="270">[270]</span> pleased, convinced that he had damaged an excellent king whose heart was absolute for God. Satan, however, did not know that his temptations created opportunities for God’s wisdom to be manifested. </p>
<p data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUmWxoJQzXNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0"> Whatever the enemy of God does gives God the opportunity to show forth His wisdom. If we had never been poisoned and corrupted, we would not have needed God very much, and there would have been no need for God’s salvation. The more sinful, corrupt, and damaged we are, the greater is our need for God and the more opportunity there is for God to do something for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="7_JcBoLt_f4p4TwS9GhdcDPmZ4eON0dHgTG9jncdwDuWZJuJ-gcIVOYb7Z2qhulnR"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88305" data-verses="Ephesians 3:10">verse 10</span> Paul declares that God’s multifarious wisdom is made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies through the church. The church is the Body of Christ, the joint-heirs, and the joint-partakers. The church is composed of those who once were ruined, corrupted, and damaged. Before we were saved, we were vipers, poisonous serpents. Furthermore, we were dead in trespasses and sins. Moreover, we were scattered and divided, utterly unable to be one. Thus, all the members of the church were in a hopeless situation. Nevertheless, God in His wisdom is able to make us the church. Now we are not only redeemed, saved, cleansed, freed, liberated, and regenerated—we are also united. We are one with God and with one another. Therefore, we are the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="_gz5R_nH5oLy8-la4zwars7lWBAIdijurKKMBUDGJR9KRsTuy0qXMYueEupKE4DZW"> The church is God’s greatest boast. Although you may not care that much for the church, God cares very much for the church. Sometimes God may say, “Look, Satan, I have taken the very people whom you have ruined and I have made them into the church. Do you have the wisdom to do such a thing? You do not have this wisdom, but I have it.” </p>

<p data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4agatKxgcOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1"> The Apostle Paul begins his prayer in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88317" data-verses="Ephesians 3:14">verse 14</span> with the words “for this cause.” The cause for which Paul prayed is hidden in the depths of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88318" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">chapter three</span>. We have seen that in this chapter Paul presents himself as a pattern of one who has seen God’s economy. Paul received the revelation that God’s economy is God’s dispensing of Himself into His chosen ones to make them the expansion, the enlargement, of Christ, who is the embodiment of God, for God’s full expression. Having received such a revelation, Paul became an apostle, a sent one. He was also a prophet, one who spoke for God. Paul not only spoke for God, but he even spoke forth God. As God’s spokesman, Paul ministered the unsearchable riches of Christ to others so that they might see the same revelation and also become apostles and prophets. This means that Paul’s desire was to produce more apostles and prophets. For this purpose he even suffered imprisonment. But the more he was confined in prison, the more revelation he received and the more of Christ he was <span class="pg" data-page-id="276" id="276">[276]</span> able to minister to the believers to make them all apostles and prophets. All this is the cause for which Paul prayed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88319" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="IYKcWTBZD2wraBqVv8VOsOtDfdn8Iu5Z92lk4lPzJmdAd2biN-nCndK5RLnSYtepK"> When some hear that all the saints can be apostles and prophets, they may wonder about <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88320" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:29">1 Corinthians 12:29</span>, a verse which says, “Are all apostles? are all prophets?” Not all are <em>the</em> apostles or <em>the</em> prophets, but, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88321" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:31">1 Corinthians 14:31</span> says, all can prophesy. <em>The</em> apostles and <em>the</em> prophets were those who took the lead in the New Testament. The difference between us and them is that they were the leaders and we are the followers. But this does not mean that we cannot do what the leading apostles and prophets did. In the same principle, the difference between the elders and all the other members in a local church is that the elders take the lead and the other members follow. This does not mean, however, that the other members cannot do what the elders do. On the contrary, all the members should do what the elders do, and they should do even more. How different this is from the concept in Christianity that the laymen cannot do what the ministers do! The elders are not a higher rank; rather, all are of the same rank. The only difference is that the elders take the lead, like sheep who walk at the front of the flock. Likewise, the leading apostles and prophets are not on a higher level than the rest of the saints. They take the lead, and we all follow them to do what they do. </p>
<p data-content-id="HfUkPNVdvPc-TGtNi_PIz-v8w1zLd3n27HnTj40Roiaxg_VGkAzUncYLNZiT2Ke0a"> When I came to this country, I came with a revelation concerning Christ for the church. Having received such a revelation, I was sent here to speak for God and even to speak forth God. I am simply a follower of <em>the</em> apostles and prophets in the New Testament. My burden is for all the saints to become such followers. I hope that one day thousands will be sent out to speak for God. Although we cannot be the leading apostles, we can be the followers. In like manner, we cannot be <em>the</em> prophets, but we all can prophesy. We all can be sent, and we all can speak for Christ. What a privilege, a mercy, and a grace to be the followers of the leading apostles and prophets! <span class="pg" data-page-id="277" id="277">[277]</span> </p>

The “Father” here is used in a broad sense, signifying not only the Father of the household of faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88323" data-verses="Galatians 6:10">Gal. 6:10</span>), but the Father of every family in the heavens and on earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88324" data-verses="Ephesians 3:15">v. 15</span>). The Father is the source, not only of the regenerated believers, but also of the God-created mankind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88325" data-verses="Luke 3:38">Luke 3:38</span>), of the God-created Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88326" data-verses="Isaiah 63:16">Isa. 63:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88327" data-verses="Isaiah 64:8">64:8</span>), and of the God-created angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88328" data-verses="Job 1:6">Job 1:6</span>). The Jews’ concept was that God was Father only to them. So the apostle prayed to the Father of all the families in the heavens and on earth, according to his revelation, not as the Jews, who prayed only to the Father of Israel, according to the Jewish concept. </p>
<p data-content-id="TS0vLm3wTVrzuTUulNHSpsNG0UDS2c-25mTg4xYz74KQnIYS77RmuCw_eSmkzr8AS"> Since God is the source of the angelic family in the heavens and all the human families on earth, so it is of God that every family is named, just as producers give names to their products and fathers give names to their children. </p>

The need in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88331" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> is for us to see the things related to the Body of Christ, to see how the Body comes into existence and how it is constituted. But it is inadequate simply to see the revelation; we also need the experience of what we see. Because we need to experience Christ in a subjective way, Paul prayed that we would be strengthened with power into the inner man. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4SxWofFDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu">A.

Glory is the expression of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88333" data-verses="John 1:18">John 1:18</span> says, “No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.” In this declaration of God there is glory, for the declaration of God is the manifestation of God, which is glory. When the Lord Jesus expressed God on earth, God’s glory was manifested. </p>
<p data-content-id="wZZd7ZXC7lqDMlD_3-HJuDffX2ipOM5RxitkD5PpVOrwkpldqqeIgnRv2-Kvi2tyM"> All the families in the heavens and on earth express God to some extent. With their expressions of God, there are the riches of His glory. The apostle prayed that the Gentile believers might experience God in a full way according to the riches of His glory, that He might be expressed through the Gentile believers by their experiencing Him in a full way. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5ei-ryI1O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6"> What then are the riches of God’s glory? The riches of glory in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88334" data-verses="Ephesians 3:16">verse 16</span> are related to every family in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88335" data-verses="Ephesians 3:15">verse 15</span>. Every family is an expression of God to a certain degree. Because the Father is the source, the origin, of every family in the heavens and on earth, every family is His expression. The family that expresses the Father the most is the family of the believers. Therefore, Paul prayed to the Father that we might be strengthened for the purpose of expressing Him to the uttermost. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6o9xPdlsLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9">B.

This power is the resurrection power referred to in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88336" data-verses="Ephesians 1:19-20">1:19-20</span>; it is this power which operates in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88337" data-verses="Ephesians 3:20">3:20</span>). This power raised Christ up from among the dead, uplifted Him to the heavens, and put everything under His feet. With such a power God is strengthening us. </p>

If we have been strengthened into the inner man, Christ can then make His home in our hearts with the result that we are strong to apprehend with all saints what is the breadth, length, height, and depth of Christ and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of God. The result of all this is that we are filled unto all the fullness of God. Here we see several steps. From Paul’s prayer we go on to being strengthened; from being strengthened we proceed to Christ’s making His home in our hearts; and from this we progress to the apprehending and the knowing and finally to being filled unto all the fullness of God. It is by these steps that we can apprehend the dimensions of Christ and know His knowledge-surpassing love. </p>

We have pointed out that the Body is not the riches of Christ, but the fullness of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88364" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">1:23</span>). As the riches of Christ are being digested and assimilated into us, they are metabolized. By this process of metabolism we become the fullness of Christ as His expression. Many Christians regard the riches and the fullness as synonymous. The riches of Christ are the various aspects of Christ for our enjoyment, whereas the fullness is the result, the issue, of the enjoyment of these riches. For example, when we eat and digest the riches of American foodstuffs, we become the fullness of America. As the fullness of America, we are the expression of America. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88365" data-verses="Ephesians 3:19">Ephesians 3:19</span> does not say that we are filled with the riches of God, but that we are filled unto the fullness of God. This means that we are filled with the result that we become the expression of God. The expression of God today is the church, which is the Body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. Hence, the fullness of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88366" data-verses="Ephesians 3:19">3:19</span> is the fullness of Christ, which is the Body, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88367" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">1:23</span>. The Body is constituted through our enjoyment of the riches of Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="285" id="285">[285]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88370" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">chapter three</span> we see that Paul, who was a leading one and a pattern, received the revelation and enjoyed the riches of Christ. These riches were metabolically constituted into his being to make him a part of the Body. All who would follow him to be today’s apostles and prophets must be the same as Paul in these matters. Then the church will be constituted to become the fullness of Christ and the fullness of God. In order for this to take place, Paul prayed that we might be strengthened into our inner man with the result that Christ could make His home in our heart and thereby occupy, possess, permeate, and saturate our whole inner being with Himself. In this way we are filled with Christ, and we become strong to apprehend the dimensions of Christ and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ. Eventually, we shall be filled with Christ to such an extent that we become the fullness of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9HrVFU7TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> As we pass through all these steps, we need to apprehend the dimensions of Christ. The Greek word translated “apprehend” means not only to know, but also to grasp, to lay hold of intensively. In order to grasp the dimensions of Christ, we need all the saints; for this we must lay hold of Christ corporately. </p>

These dimensions are the dimensions of the universe. Only God Himself knows the measurements of the universe. We can measure the distance from one point in the universe to another, for example, from the earth to the moon, but we cannot measure the universe itself. Now the very dimensions of the universe are also the dimensions of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="ORuveXsLSL_KAUQRmmsRwUAjlxfJksZhadewDeZFVr0RNBcjRKpEUgJ7ZofkxfD26"> Christ is our real universe. Elsewhere we have pointed out that Christ is our earth, our good land, and also our sun and morning star. Now, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88371" data-verses="Ephesians 3:18">verse 18</span>, we have the boldness to say that Christ is our universe, for His <span class="pg" data-page-id="286" id="286">[286]</span> dimensions are the dimensions of the universe. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88372" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span> speaks of the fullness of Him who fills all in all, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88373" data-verses="Ephesians 4:9-10">4:9 and 10</span> reveal that He who descended into the lower parts of the earth also ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things. When we enter into the new heaven and the new earth to dwell in the New Jerusalem, we all shall realize that Christ the Lord is our universe. </p>

This is horizontal. When we advance in Christ, we experience the height and depth of His riches. This is vertical. Firstly we experience Christ spreading as the breadth and the length. Later we experience Him rising up as the height and finally descending as the depth. As we shall see, our experience of Christ must eventually become three-dimensional, like a cube. </p>
<p data-content-id="3GEuFAt2o9byg8MZDzK996mf_fH7FXg_LkbTuP-LW2tuU3xrWTByUo7lMUOiCI2ZU"> If we have only the length of Christ, without any breadth, our experience will be a “line,” that is, an experience that is long and narrow to an extreme. Our experience of Christ, however, should not have only one dimension, like a line, but it should have two dimensions, like a square, and then three dimensions, like a cube. It is of great importance that we all have a two-dimensional, or a “square,” experience of Christ. If we have only a “line” experience of Him, this “line” will eventually continue until it reaches an extreme. All extremists are “one-liners,” those whose experience of Christ is on a single “line.” If you experience Christ properly and normally as the breadth and the length, you will be kept from going to an extreme. Do not go too far out on the “line” of a narrow and long experience of Christ. Rather, experience Him in a “square” way as the breadth and as the length. By experiencing Christ continually as the breadth and length, our experience will be like a solidly woven “carpet,” not a long, single “thread.” </p>
<p data-content-id="GJHsP88GHseo8rpjYyem_lGHRqQ544KrNMLYo1DtwblC8XXjSuatQl8WDTK_MeK3O"> Some examples will help to make this matter clear. For a number of years, I listened to a certain great Bible teacher. <span class="pg" data-page-id="287" id="287">[287]</span> He was extremely knowledgeable in the Scriptures. Although he spent very little time in prayer, he was constantly reading the Word and writing notes
in his Bible. After talking about the Bible for a period of time, he would excuse himself in order to smoke his pipe. Then he would resume his discussion of the Scriptures. With him there was a “line” of only one dimension—an extreme emphasis on studying the Bible—but there was not the normal spreading of Christ in two dimensions as a “square” in his experience. </p>

Through His indwelling, Christ continually imparts the very element of God into our being.

The church is neither organized nor formed; it is metabolically constituted in us through our experience and enjoyment of the riches of Christ. In order for the church to be constituted in a practical way, we need to be strengthened into our inner man. Then Christ must make His home in our hearts; He must occupy all the parts of our inner being and saturate them with His riches. Then we need to be rooted <span class="pg" data-page-id="292" id="292">[292]</span> and grounded in love, rooted for growth and grounded for building. Following this, we must grasp the dimensions of Christ. This is to experience Christ in His universal dimensions both horizontally and vertically. Along with this, we come to know in our experience the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ. As a result of all these experiences, we are eventually filled unto all the fullness of God. Therefore, being filled unto the fullness of God is the outcome, the result, of all the deeper, higher, and richer experiences of Christ described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88385" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span>. </p>

Some may be troubled at such a statement and may wonder how this claim can be substantiated. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88386" data-verses="Ephesians 3:21">verse 21</span> Paul says, “To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus.” According to the context, the church in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88387" data-verses="Ephesians 3:21">verse 21</span> is the very fullness of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88388" data-verses="Ephesians 3:19">verse 19</span>. When in our experience we are filled unto all the fullness of God, the church comes into being in a practical way. It is at such a time that Paul says, “To Him be the glory in the church.” This glory is the expression of God. Hence, in the fullness of God there is the expression of God. Therefore, the fullness of God is the church as God’s expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5ei4ryI9O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6"> Some translations of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88389" data-verses="Ephesians 3:19">verse 19</span> say, “filled <em>with</em> all the fullness of God.” According to this rendering, the fullness of God would have to be the element, the essence, with which we are filled. But this is a mistaken understanding of this verse. Here Paul is saying that we shall be filled <em>unto</em> all the fullness of God, that is, we shall be filled to be the expression of God. </p>

Isn’t this <span class="pg" data-page-id="293" id="293">[293]</span> fullness the riches of Christ? How then can you make a distinction between the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ?” When Christ was on earth with His disciples, would you say that the riches of God were there with Him or that the fullness of God was there with Him? If the riches had been with Him but the fullness had not, something would have been lacking; there would have been no completion. For example, suppose a glass jar contains just a few pieces of delicious candies. The jar contains some riches of the candies but not the fullness. However, after the jar is filled with the candies, it will have not only the riches but also the fullness. If the jar remains only partly filled, there will not be in the jar the expression of the candies. Because the fullness is the expression, without the fullness there can be no expression. Only when the candies fill the jar to the brim will there be the fullness as the expression of the riches. </p>
<p data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OEnZSbw2SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH"> When the Lord Jesus came, He no doubt brought all the riches of God with Him. However, with Him there were not only the riches of God, but there was also the fullness of God. This is the reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88392" data-verses="John 1:16">John 1:16</span> says that we all have received of His fullness; it does not say that we have received of His riches. If you take a piece of candy from a jar filled with candies, you will be receiving candy, not from the riches of the jar, but from its fullness. </p>
<p data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2etccK13ogmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg"> The fullness is the completion of the riches. In Greek the word for “fullness” means completion. Hence, it is correct to render this Greek word as “completeness.” The Greek word translated “of” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88393" data-verses="John 1:16">John 1:16</span> means “out from” or “out of.” Thus, out of the fullness of Christ, the completeness of all the riches of God, we have all received. </p>
<p data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiEjpr6ji8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND"> Before retiring at night, I often enjoy a glass of protein drink, preferably a glass filled to the brim. As I drink from such a full glass, I partake of the fullness of the protein drink in the glass. When Christ came, He did not come only partially filled with the riches of God. On the contrary, He was filled to the brim. Hence, the fullness, the completeness of what God is, was present with Him. This fullness, this <span class="pg" data-page-id="294" id="294">[294]</span> completeness, is the expression of God. The Lord Jesus was like the glass, and the riches of God with which He was filled unto all the fullness of God were like the protein drink.

This is the reason that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88394" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">3:8</span> Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ and then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88395" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">1:23</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88396" data-verses="Ephesians 4:13">4:13</span> speaks of the fullness of Christ. The riches of Christ are the various aspects of what Christ is, and the fullness of Christ is the result, the issue, of our enjoyment of these riches. As we enjoy the riches of Christ, these riches are assimilated into our being metabolically. Then they constitute us into the fullness of Christ, into the Body of Christ, the church, as His expression. Therefore, the fullness of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88397" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">1:23</span> is the very fullness of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88398" data-verses="Ephesians 3:19">3:19</span>.

We also need Christ to make His home in our heart, that is, to occupy, possess, and metabolically saturate every part of our inward being with all that He is. Then we shall be rooted for the growth in life and grounded for the building. Furthermore, we shall become strong to grasp Christ experientially in all His universal dimensions. Along with this, we shall know through our experience the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ. When we have experienced Christ to such an extent, we shall be filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God. All this is for the constituting of the church in a practical way as the Body of Christ for His expression. </p>

The highest definition of the church is that it is the fullness of God. We must admit that among us today we do not yet have the church as the fullness of God, as God’s full expression. However, we believe that the church will come up to this level. The fact that the Lord has spoken such a word concerning the church is an indication that He will do what He has spoken. The Lord’s word will not return void (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88415" data-verses="Isaiah 55:11">Isa. 55:11</span>). Whatever He speaks, He will <span class="pg" data-page-id="300" id="300">[300]</span> perform. For example, when God spoke something in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88416" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, it came to pass. Therefore, we believe that the Lord’s word regarding the church as the fullness of God will be accomplished. Not only do we believe this word, but we also claim it and pray according to it. We need to pray, “Lord, You have spoken concerning the church as the fullness of God. Now You must fulfill what You have spoken.” When the church on earth reaches the stage of being the fullness of God, we shall be able to say with Paul, “To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus.” </p>

In his prayer Paul asked that the Father would strengthen the saints according to the riches of His glory. This implies that the glory of God is wrought into the saints. In the doxology Paul said, “To Him be the glory” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88418" data-verses="Ephesians 3:21">v. 21</span>). This implies that the glory of God returns to God after it has been wrought into the saints. Firstly, the glory of God is wrought into us; then it returns to God for His glorification. As an illustration, Isaac’s wealth was firstly given to Rebekah for her beautification; then when Rebekah came to Isaac, all the wealth came back to Isaac with Rebekah for his glorification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88419" data-verses="Genesis 24:47">Gen. 24:47</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88420" data-verses="Genesis 24:53">53</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88421" data-verses="Genesis 24:61-67">61-67</span>). The apostle prayed that God would strengthen the saints according to His glory, but eventually God’s glory, after being wrought into them, returns to Him along with the strengthened saints. This is the way God is glorified in the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="4hu3V9NSxOD4qIDQx-aI8nyTKXQAVHAukquOkznsExY9T1eCWD6YHuZmIvOhld_9j"> We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88422" data-verses="Ephesians 3:16">verse 16</span> Paul prayed that the Father would grant us, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power into our inner man. To be strengthened according to glory is to have the glory of God worked into our being. This is the only way to be strengthened according to God’s glory. Suppose a person who is physically very weak can be strengthened according to someone who is physically strong. This would mean that the strength of the strong one is wrought into the very fibers of <span class="pg" data-page-id="301" id="301">[301]</span> the weak one. In the same principle, to be strengthened into the inner man according to the Father’s glory means to have His glory wrought into our being. Firstly, the glory comes to us, and then it goes back to God. When the glory comes into our being, we are filled and strengthened. When it returns to God, He is glorified in the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="od6p5sc1GDqOFwWB01GI4UN9FvyhwTvvTOTFDcnJar4LT8Qnqe8UcaKDTX05Qn6K7"> The Greek word rendered “but” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88423" data-verses="Ephesians 3:20">verse 20</span> can also be translated “now.” In such a case “now” would mean “in view of the fact that” or “based on the preceding.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88424" data-verses="Ephesians 3:20-21">verses 20 and 21</span> it seems that Paul was saying, “Now that the church has come into existence as the fullness of God, God can be glorified in the church. Before this time it was impossible for the glory to return to God. But because the church has become the fullness of God in a practical way, this is now possible.” </p>
<p data-content-id="3GEuFAt2o9byg8MZDzK996mf5fH3HXg_LkbTuP-LW2tuU3xrWTByUo7lMUOiCI2ZU"> It is correct to translate the Greek word here as either “but” or “now.” In either case the word is not a meaningless insertion. The word “but” suggests that the glory which has come to us and which has been wrought into our being is now going back to God with us. The word “now” suggests that, in view of the fact that the church has come into existence as the fullness of God, God may at this time be glorified in the church. Both are true. </p>
<p data-content-id="GJHsP88GHseo8rpjYyem_lGHXqQ164KrNMLYo1DtwblC8XXjSuatQl8WDTK_MeK3O"> The church is the glory of God coming to us with God and going back to God with us. In such a church there is two-way traffic between God and us, and between us and God. By means of this two-way traffic, God’s glory is wrought into us and God is glorified in us. This traffic is signified by the little word “but.” </p>

For these spiritual things, we need not only to ask, but also to think. We may think more than we ask. God fulfills not only what we <span class="pg" data-page-id="302" id="302">[302]</span> ask for the church, but also what we think concerning the church, and God is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think for the church through the power which operates in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="EkaMV3Soowz1Y1LdwSAggraM9cxwo6M0H0MN5WrZ4ZYcDUwX2c921mm7c4iIL8IZY"> God’s ability to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88426" data-verses="Ephesians 3:20">verse 20</span>, is different from His ability in creation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88427" data-verses="Ephesians 3:20">Verse 20</span> refers not to creation, but to the church. A number of times I have heard the saints quote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88428" data-verses="Ephesians 3:20">verse 20</span> in testifying concerning their experience of God’s material blessing. To quote this verse for such a purpose is to misapply it. Paul’s concept here is related not to what God does outside of us, but to what He does inside of us. He specifically mentions “the power which operates in us.” This is the inward power, the resurrection power, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88429" data-verses="Ephesians 1:19-20">1:19 and 20</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="D20V42Q_F8EMHQVYOrygvO7J32B2o4EAp5I6xaxu5BS3a8z8gUxLYQQk1sl7LSiAO"> God’s creating power is the origin of the material things in our environment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88430" data-verses="Romans 8:28">Rom. 8:28</span>), whereas God’s resurrection power accomplishes the spiritual things for the church within our inward being. In order for God to give us a good job, there is no need for resurrection power to operate in us. God’s being able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think is related not to His acts in our environment, but to His working organically and metabolically within us. As far as the environment is concerned, there may be times when God apparently does nothing for you. You may pray for a promotion, but He allows you to be laid off from your present job. During this time of unemployment, God may operate within you to enable Christ to make His home in you. When we are in a favorable environment, there may be very little opportunity for Christ to spread Himself in our hearts. But when we are placed in a difficult environment, the Lord may have more of an opportunity to spread within our inward being. From our side, it may seem beneficial for us to be in a good environment, but from the Lord’s side, it may be better for us to be in a difficult environment, for then He may have greater opportunity to work within us. </p>

This indicates that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88439" data-verses="Ephesians 3:2-21">3:2-21</span> is all parenthetical. </p>

The first, composed of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88440" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapters one through three</span>, reveals the blessing and the position which the church has obtained in Christ in the heavenlies. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88441" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Chapter three</span>, in particular, reveals how the church comes into existence in a practical way through being constituted with the riches of the living Christ. The second section, comprising <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88442" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapters four through six</span>, charges us concerning the living and responsibility the church should have in the Spirit on the earth. The basic charge is that we should walk worthily of the calling, which is the totality of the blessings bestowed upon the church, as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88443" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3-14">1:3-14</span>. In the church, under the Triune God’s abundant blessing, the saints should walk worthily of the Father’s selection and predestination, the Son’s redemption, and the Spirit’s sealing and pledging. </p>
<p data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fBRTNPVcEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z"> In walking worthily of God’s calling, the church must have a certain kind of life and also bear responsibility to the full extent. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88444" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapters four through six</span> we see, on the one hand, the living the church should have, and, on the other hand, the responsibility the church should bear. </p>
<p data-content-id="inTRR5aqA6f3Zp0g5VCt5vCwixBJYPP9fz0SGMS6TD8Ev1RYK0XGG-yq2bZI5h3Uz"> In exhorting the saints to walk worthily of God’s calling, Paul spoke from his status as a prisoner in the Lord. His status as an apostle of Christ through the will of God <span class="pg" data-page-id="306" id="306">[306]</span> authorized him to reveal the things concerning the church, to speak concerning the mystery of Christ. However, his status as a prisoner in the Lord qualified him to exhort us to walk worthily of God’s high calling. Paul’s living was surely worthy of God’s calling. Furthermore, he bore the responsibility required by this calling. </p>
<p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQseI9umddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88445" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">3:1</span> Paul speaks of himself as “the prisoner of Christ Jesus,” but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88446" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">4:1</span> he says that he is “the prisoner in the Lord.” To be a prisoner <em>in</em> the Lord is deeper than to be a prisoner <em>of</em> the Lord. As such a prisoner, Paul was a pattern for those who would walk worthily of God’s calling. </p>

We must keep the oneness of the Spirit. This is crucial and vital to the Body of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="WMnpS5Obzk_YTS3q3GOFH1SFqAwpMrnZYpJ1P_jLUOjwyCSv5ZbC6HMtrIdmASj5I"> Oneness, strictly speaking, differs from unity. Unity is formed by many people uniting together, whereas oneness is the one entity of the Spirit within the believers making them all one. Some Christians may have a certain kind of unity, but we in the Lord’s recovery appreciate oneness much more than unity. In the Lord’s recovery, we are not united—that is, we have not formed a certain kind of union—but we are one. Our oneness is a Person, even the Lord Jesus Himself realized as the life-giving Spirit. Today the Lord is the life-giving Spirit within us, and this Spirit is our oneness. Therefore, our oneness is not an objective Person far away in the heavens; it is a subjective Person indwelling us as our life. </p>
<p data-content-id="2dq7QF0hlVfHljch6uMOWbrM38vUpD7PM_en5LHupWopm5T9JM8tlnCWOoNUSQNy6"> This oneness is similar to the electricity in many lights that makes them all one in the shining. Although there may be dozens of lights in a large room, they are one in the electricity that flows within them. In themselves, the lights are not one; neither are they united to form one entity. The unique electricity in the lights is their oneness. This electricity does not unite the lights; it is the oneness within them. In themselves, the lights are individual and separate, but in the electricity they have oneness. It is the same in <span class="pg" data-page-id="307" id="307">[307]</span> principle with the believers in Christ. The Spirit indwelling us is our oneness. </p>
<p data-content-id="uRn6e8DCDhYvxWArZZyg1AABVPaerbWQ-S4ajELiYI6nagGr9Sjsomhlk1pMnAffa"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88447" data-verses="Ephesians 4:3">4:3</span> this oneness is called “the oneness of the Spirit.” The oneness of the Spirit is actually the Spirit Himself. In the illustration of the electricity and the lights, the oneness of the electricity is the electricity itself. There is not another element, apart from the electricity, that is the oneness of the electricity. The oneness of the electricity is simply the electricity itself. In the same principle, the oneness of the Spirit is not something apart from the Spirit. On the contrary, it is the Spirit Himself. The oneness within us and among us is the very life-giving Spirit. Therefore, to keep the oneness is to keep the life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4agapKx5TOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1"> Many Christians talk about unity or oneness but neglect the Spirit. This indicates that they make oneness something separate from the Spirit. The more talk certain believers have had about unity, the more divided they have become. Some can even argue with one another in a fleshly way over the matter of unity. There is no need for us to talk so much about oneness. Oneness is like a dove. If we do not talk about it, the dove is present with us. But if we talk about it, it flies away. When we talk a great deal about oneness, we are in danger of losing it. We do not keep the oneness by talking about it; we keep it by staying in the life-giving Spirit. As long as we love the Lord and embrace Him, we keep the oneness; for, as we have strongly emphasized, oneness is the Person of Christ as the life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="IYKcWTBZD2wraBqVv8VOsOtDbdnZEu5Z92lk4lPzJmdAd2biN-nCndK5RLnSYtepK"> Keeping the oneness of the Spirit implies that we already have the Spirit. If we did not have Him, how could we keep Him? However, most Christians live apart from the Spirit most of the time. Any action taken apart from the life-giving Spirit is divisive. When we are one with the Spirit, living according to Him and doing all things in Him, we keep the oneness without making any conscious effort to do so. But whenever we act apart from the Spirit, we are divisive and lose the oneness. Therefore, instead of charging you to talk about oneness, I would encourage you to take care of the life-giving Spirit, who is the Lord Himself as life within you. <span class="pg" data-page-id="308" id="308">[308]</span> </p>

We should have these two virtues in dealing with ourselves. Long-suffering is to endure mistreatment. We should have this virtue in dealing with others. By these virtues we bear one another; that is, we do not forsake the troublesome ones but bear them in love. This is the expression of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="kW37bRWd4n3ChsU9j6t193oKZSZGaNT7Km646Yo-l1oZoLWUehit8wxR0xamoxSLO"> The word “all” governs both lowliness and meekness. It does not mean that there are many kinds of lowliness and meekness; it means that we should have lowliness and meekness in all things. Thus, we must keep the oneness of the Spirit with all lowliness and meekness. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jf0PJ3Yzh-Zban-Z3PEii4PHkX0Kz6DqyCleWzpwECAyBCCrwndk4EBUpamTJ1Vjs"> The problem, however, is that in ourselves we cannot be either lowly or meek. If we are honest and sincere, we shall admit that we have no genuine lowliness or meekness. On the contrary, we tend to exalt ourselves and to fight in defense of ourselves. Just as we do not have lowliness or meekness, we are not long-suffering and we cannot bear others in love. Nevertheless, Paul charges us to have such a worthy walk. </p>
<p data-content-id="ziHhFbwj9qduVCwT62zA_ZS6gUWJJVUD31ttVpb1c14zDjDyuEyTtvwQz3ufe66GN"> If we would keep the oneness of the Spirit, we must have a proper humanity, a humanity with lowliness, meekness, and long-suffering and a humanity that bears others in love. If we do not have such a humanity as our “capital,” then we cannot operate the “business” of keeping the oneness of the Spirit. The fact that the virtues in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88449" data-verses="Ephesians 4:2">verse 2</span> are mentioned before the oneness of the Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88450" data-verses="Ephesians 4:3">verse 3</span> indicates that we must have these virtues in order to keep the oneness of the Spirit. </p>

These seven ones are of three groups. The first three can be grouped together, the Spirit with the Body as His expression and the Body related to the one hope. This Body, having been regenerated and being saturated with the Spirit as its essence, has the hope of being transfigured into the full likeness of Christ. The next three can also be grouped together, the Lord with faith and baptism, that we may be joined to Him. Then we have one God and Father, who is the Originator and source of all. The Spirit as the Executor of the Body, the Son as the Creator of the Body, and God the Father as the Originator of the Body—all three of the Triune God—are related to the Body. The third of the Trinity is mentioned first because the main concern here is the Body, and the Spirit is the essence of the Body. Then the course is traced back to the Son and then to the Father. </p>

If we do not see this relationship, we shall not be able to know why Paul put the one Spirit and the one hope together with the one Body. The Spirit is the essence of the one Body. Without the Spirit, the Body is empty and has no life. The Body here is the Body of Christ, and the essence of the Body of Christ is the Spirit. Hence, the Body and the essence of the Body are one. It is impossible for the Body of Christ to have more than one essence. The unique essence of the Body is the Spirit. </p>

On one hand, we appreciate our bodies because they are useful and because without them we cannot exist in this world.

In speaking about the transfiguration of the body in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88469" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:1">1 Corinthians 15</span>, Paul <span class="pg" data-page-id="315" id="315">[315]</span> compares our bodies to seeds (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88470" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:35-44">vv. 35-44</span>).

For this reason, the worldly people treat us the same as everyone else, without any realization that we are sons of God. However, the time is coming when our sonship will be manifested. Then it will no longer be necessary to tell others that we are Christians. It will be apparent to all that we are sons of God in glory. The manifestation of the sons of God will also be the glorification of the sons of God. This is our hope. </p>
<p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyT3KtHUUr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> Neither the transfiguration of our body nor our manifestation as the sons of God will merely be a sudden, unexpected occurrence. On the contrary, both our transfiguration and our manifestation are gradually taking place today. Yes, there is a sense in which transfiguration and manifestation will take place suddenly. But according to the truth of the New Testament and according to our experience, transfiguration and manifestation are also a gradual process in which we are involved today. This process is being carried out by the one Spirit, who is the essence, the life, and the life supply of the Body of Christ. The Spirit is presently working within us to transfigure us and to manifest our sonship. This is the reason Paul linked the one hope and the one Spirit to the one Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8raGawMSiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> As believers, we are members of the Body of Christ. Although you are a member of the Body, are you satisfied with the way you are? If we are honest, we shall admit that the present situation of both ourselves and the church is less than satisfactory. We need to be transfigured. Within us as members of the Body and within the Body as a whole there is the one Spirit, who is the essence of the Body and the life and life supply of the Body. This Spirit is neither dormant nor idle; on the contrary, He is working energetically within us toward the goal of bringing us into the fulfillment of the hope of our calling. This is why we say that the transfiguration of the body will not be accidental. Today the indwelling Spirit <span class="pg" data-page-id="316" id="316">[316]</span> is carrying out both the transfiguration of the body and the manifestation of the sons of God. Because we are in the process of transfiguration and manifestation, the rapture should not come as a surprise. Rather, it should be a normal experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxi21sjnbAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88472" data-verses="Ephesians 4:4">Verse 4</span> implies that the indwelling Spirit today is carrying out the process of bringing the Body of Christ into glory as the fulfillment of our hope. Therefore, in this verse we have the one Body, the one Spirit, and the one hope. Because we all are in the one Body with the one Spirit and have the one hope, we are one. There is no reason for us not to be one, and there is no cause to be different. We are one Body, and we have the one Spirit working within us to bring us to the goal of our hope. </p>

In the Gospel of John it is the Son in whom we believe (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88474" data-verses="John 3:16">3:16</span>), but in Acts, it is the Lord in whom we believe (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88475" data-verses="Acts 16:31">Acts 16:31</span>). In the writings of John, the Son is for life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88476" data-verses="1John 5:12">1 John 5:12</span>), whereas in Acts, the Lord, after His ascension, is for authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88477" data-verses="Acts 2:36">Acts 2:36</span>), a matter which concerns His headship. Here, as the Head of the Body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88478" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22">Eph. 1:22</span>), He is the Lord. Our believing in Christ is related to both life and authority. Not many Christians, however, realize that they must believe in the Lord for authority as well as for life. As lost sinners, we were not only spiritually dead, but we were also without the Lord, without a head. But after believing in the Lord, we have both life and a head. </p>
<p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQsfI9Dtddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> In Ephesians the oneness of the Body is related not only to life but also to headship. Christians are divided because they do not care for the Head. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88479" data-verses="Ephesians 4:4">verse 4</span> Paul covers life, which is closely related to the Spirit. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88480" data-verses="Ephesians 4:5">verse 5</span> he deals with authority. Today few Christians care for life, and even fewer have any care for authority. By the Lord’s mercy and grace, we in the Lord’s recovery care both for life and for <span class="pg" data-page-id="317" id="317">[317]</span> headship. We have not only the one Body with the one Spirit and the one hope, but also the one Lord with the one faith and the one baptism. </p>

Although the basic elements of the Body are one, the gifts, or the functions, are many and varied. The word “but” at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88495" data-verses="Ephesians 4:7">verse 7</span> brings out this contrast between the oneness of the Body and the variety of the gifts or functions. </p>

Grace actually is the divine life that both produces and supplies the gifts. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88498" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span> it is the grace that produces the gift. Thus, the gift is according to grace.

Hence, here the grace is according to the gift, according to the measure of the gift. Grace according to the measure of the gift can be compared to our blood, which supplies the members of our body according to their size. The measure of the gift of Christ is the size of a member of His Body. </p>

He Who descended is the same Who also ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.” The “lower parts of the earth” refers to Hades, underneath the earth, where Christ went after His death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88519" data-verses="Acts 2:27">Acts 2:27</span>). Christ firstly descended from heaven to earth in His incarnation. Then after He died on the cross, in His death He descended further, from earth to Hades. Eventually, in His resurrection He ascended from Hades to earth, and from earth to heaven in His ascension. By His descending in death and ascending in resurrection, He gave gifts to men. </p>

The thought here is profound. Firstly, Christ was in the heavens. In His incarnation He came down to earth as a man and lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years. Then He died on the cross and descended into Hades, ascended in resurrection from Hades to earth, and then ascended to the third heaven. By means of such a traffic of descending and ascending, He fills all things. Now Christ is everywhere, on the earth as well as in the heavens. </p>

It indicates that Christ gave apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers for the purpose of perfecting the <span class="pg" data-page-id="324" id="324">[324]</span> saints. The saints are perfected “unto the work of ministry.” The Greek word translated “unto” means “resulting in.” Therefore, the perfecting of the saints results in the work of ministry. The many gifted persons in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88521" data-verses="Ephesians 4:11">verse 11</span> have only one ministry, that of ministering Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ, the church.

Christ has a fullness, the fullness has a stature, and the stature has a measure. We must arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.

We have seen that, concerning the Body, all the basic elements are one. However, the gifts and the functions are different.

How could a sinful, devilish persecutor of the church such as Saul of Tarsus become a gift to the Body of Christ? Only by the traveling of Christ throughout the universe. Christ traveled from <span class="pg" data-page-id="325" id="325">[325]</span> the heavens to the earth. He was born in a manger in Bethlehem, and He lived for about thirty years in the little town of Nazareth. After He was crucified on the cross, He went down into Hades and took a tour of that region for three days. Then He came out of Hades on the day of His resurrection. Between His resurrection and ascension, He appeared to His disciples over a period of forty days. At the end of those forty days, He ascended into the heavens. </p>

Paul, however, was a model not only of God’s salvation, but also of one called by the Lord. </p>

Many think that this goal is simply to receive grace and to be saved. Grace and salvation, however, are not the ultimate goal of God’s calling. According to Ephesians, the unique goal of God’s calling is the building up of the Body of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88539" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">Matthew 16</span> the Lord Jesus said that He would build His church. The book of Acts and the Epistles reveal that the church is built up not by the Lord directly, but through the members of the Body. Christ builds the Body by the Body. God has called us for the fulfillment of this goal. </p>

Do not think that Paul was such a steward and that you are not. Paul’s intention here is to impress the saints with the fact that they all have received the stewardship of the grace of God for the building up of the Body of Christ. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88544" data-verses="Ephesians 4:12">4:12</span>, the building up of the Body is not the work of the apostles alone; it is the responsibility of all the saints. This verse reveals that the saints are perfected unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ. The Greek word rendered “unto” in this verse also means “for the purpose of,” “with a view to,” or “resulting in.” The perfecting of the saints results in the work of ministry, which in turn results in the building up of the Body of Christ. The Body is not built up directly by the apostles and the other leading ones; it is built up directly by the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="MiS0T4a3KCiS0HGposEC8jSYmqKJAv0mQ1p8RXf91j3qhYPyaQ4vSp2OaxeR_yzEI"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88545" data-verses="Ephesians 4:16">4:16</span> Paul says, “Out from Whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88546" data-verses="Ephesians 4:12">Verse 12</span> speaks of the saints, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88547" data-verses="Ephesians 4:16">verse 16</span> mentions “each one part.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88548" data-verses="Ephesians 4:16">verse 16</span>, the Body causes the growth of itself unto the building up of itself in love. In order for this to take place in a practical way, all the saints need to be perfected by the apostles and the other leading ones. </p>

Paul’s expectation was that every believer would be an apostle. This means that Paul expected every saint to be the same as he was. </p>
<p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQsRI9Pvddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> Paul was not only an apostle; he was also a prophet, an evangelist, and a shepherd and teacher. Many of us, however, may classify the gifted ones mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88549" data-verses="Ephesians 4:11">verse 11</span> into four distinct categories: the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. But Paul, the pattern of God’s called one, was all of these. Paul certainly was a prophet. In his Epistles he uttered some great <span class="pg" data-page-id="331" id="331">[331]</span> prophecies, such as those found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88550" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:1">1 Corinthians 15</span> and in 1 and 2 Thessalonians. Paul was also an evangelist. Who was a greater evangelist than he was? He preached the gospel wherever he went. Furthermore, Paul was a shepherd and a teacher. Day and night, he cared for all the churches and all the saints. Finally, who can deny that Paul was a teacher? If Paul was not a teacher, then no one in the New Testament was a teacher. Therefore, Paul was an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist, and a shepherd and teacher. His burden and intention in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88551" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">chapters three and four</span> was to point out that every saint should be the same as he was in these respects. </p>
<p data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bDTjOVJW0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88552" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Chapters three and four</span> are part of Paul’s charge concerning a walk worthy of God’s calling. If we would have a walk worthy of God’s calling, we need to be like the Apostle Paul. To have a worthy walk, we should devote our attention not only to such things as humility, kindness, and love, but to the important matter of being apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. If we are not such persons, then we do not have a walk worthy of God’s calling. In these chapters Paul is an example, not of a victorious Christian nor even of a believer who is full of life, but of one who is an apostle, prophet, evangelist, and shepherd and teacher. </p>

An apostle is not a king; he is a sent one. If I send you out to do a specific task, then you are my sent one, my apostle. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88553" data-verses="John 17:18">John 17:18</span> the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father, “As You have sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.” The “them” in this verse refers not only to the twelve Apostles, but to all the disciples. This indicates that all who believe in Christ should be sent ones. This is confirmed by the Lord’s word to the disciples in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88554" data-verses="John 20:21">John 20:21</span>: “As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.” All disciples of the Lord Jesus, both male and female, are to be sent ones. If you have been a <span class="pg" data-page-id="332" id="332">[332]</span> Christian for years without ever having been sent by Him, you are not up to the standard. If we consider our past experience, we shall realize that many of us have been sent—to our husband or wife, to our parents and relatives, and to our friends. Like Paul, we are sent ones, we are apostles. </p>
<p data-content-id="nFupmXdU7v_F8Wz3VyT4gw6hGecWHqgfhZHMQs6SxdJFG3VrWN2G3kyhCMk9WVErP"> We are also prophets. According to the Scriptures, a prophet does not primarily predict the future; he is one who speaks for God. For example, when Moses was called by God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88555" data-verses="Exodus 3:1-2">Exodus 3 and 4</span>, he told the Lord that he was not eloquent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88556" data-verses="Exodus 4:10">4:10</span>). The Lord said that He would give Aaron to Moses to be his prophet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88557" data-verses="Exodus 4:14-16">4:14-16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88558" data-verses="Exodus 7:1">7:1</span>). Aaron did not predict things for Moses; he spoke on his behalf. This indicates that to be a prophet is to be a spokesman. Just as we have functioned as apostles, so we have also been prophets, perhaps to our parents, relatives, and friends. As prophets, we speak on behalf of the Lord, telling others how the Lord loves them and desires to be life and everything to them. The more we speak in such a way, the more we function as prophets. </p>
<p data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR0gRBZ2OWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB"> In speaking for God, we also preach the gospel. This means that we are evangelists. To be an evangelist is simply to preach the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4S6WofJDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> In the same principle, we are also shepherds and teachers. In caring for the ones saved through our gospel preaching, we shepherd them and teach them. Hence, we are apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. </p>
<p data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAzikTlVnH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9"> To have a walk worthy of God’s calling is to be one who is sent by God, who speaks for God, who preaches the gospel, and who shepherds others and teaches them. If we are not such a person, we are not up to God’s standard. Due to the influence of our religious background and environment, we are accustomed to thinking of apostles and prophets as extraordinary people. But an apostle is an ordinary Christian, a Christian who meets God’s standard. </p>

<p data-content-id="_gz5R_nH5oLy8-la4zwars75XBAZQijurKKMBUDGJR9KRsTuy0qXMYueEupKE4DZW"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88578" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span> says, “For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you, the nations.” This verse is not a complete sentence; it contains a subject but not a predicate. All the verses from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88579" data-verses="Ephesians 3:2">3:2 through 3:21</span> are a parenthesis, and Darby places them within parentheses in his translation. This means that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88580" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">4:1</span> continues Paul’s thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88581" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">3:1</span>. As Paul was writing this Epistle, a burden rose up in him in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88582" data-verses="Ephesians 3:2">3:2</span> to utter a parenthetical word. Then he continued in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88583" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">4:1</span>, “I beseech you therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called.” Here Paul completed the thought he began to express in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88584" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">3:1</span>. Thus, by putting <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88585" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">3:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88586" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">4:1</span> together we have a complete thought. </p>
<p data-content-id="B77vULL4YXIHFFm6havIcY9xUVNL6oUVhHMvf-EO7Y7mN_8U3mz_Sb5pyhxZje63p"> The lengthy parenthesis between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88587" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">3:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88588" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">4:1</span> is an extremely crucial section of Ephesians. In this portion Paul indicated that he longed for all the believers to be the same as he was. As those who would walk worthily of God’s calling, we must take Paul as our standard. In order that we might do this, Paul presented himself as an example. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88589" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">chapter three</span> Paul did not speak on the basis of being an apostle called by God, but he spoke on the basis of being a prisoner of the Lord. As such a prisoner, he was the standard model of one who walked worthily of God’s calling. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88590" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">chapter three</span> of Ephesians Paul presented not only the standard, but also the way to reach this standard. Let us consider the various aspects of this way in some detail. <span class="pg" data-page-id="338" id="338">[338]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xOItbD1M_SnXcAkcMHRO0aDVsC_-JBIPiZ8yi6s5e1DrTLjV78UWPV1TgR921-jvh">THE UNIVERSAL STEWARDSHIP</h2><p data-content-id="rzBtTvnnp8EWQ9SXyt4WJFpSMK0VQN18pC-iFM-wWF7biwez5fLvQHeKFo4_b1dI7"> Firstly, we must all be stewards, just as Paul was (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88591" data-verses="Ephesians 3:2">3:2</span>). The stewardship is not limited to the leading apostles. Rather, it is universal; that is, it is for all the Lord’s disciples. For example, the parable of the steward in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88592" data-verses="Luke 16:1">Luke 16</span> was spoken to the disciples. This indicates that every believer, including all of us, must be a steward. I believe that, when Paul spoke of the stewardship in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88593" data-verses="Ephesians 3:2">3:2</span>, he realized within him that the stewardship is for all believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="dvx25G8sssSYMALmWN9v-wwXD3yhgwN7G3_YIZuDLoUsHACVRNy6oYa6xgCQFEpxU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88594" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span> Paul develops a concept presented by the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels. The Gospels reveal that all the believers are both stewards and slaves (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88595" data-verses="Matthew 25:14-30">Matt. 25:14-30</span>). According to the Gospels, a slave is not different from a servant, a steward. The concept in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88596" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span> is that not only the apostles are stewards and servants, but that all the believers are stewards and servants. </p>
<p data-content-id="8h6Q8qq7fu5OpgOocEN7Cqtfpk5Cf-y1o55tduWJ4FjR4dq0idwixNOYWvRUriXAE"> Because of the influence of their religious background and environment, not many Christians regard themselves as stewards. Do you realize that you are not simply a believer, one who trusts in the Lord for salvation? Moreover, have you seen that you are not just a disciple, one who is disciplined and trained? Have you seen that you are a steward, one who serves others with the riches of Christ? We all need to regard ourselves as stewards. If we have this concept, our whole Christian life will be changed. We are all stewards; even we could be called waiters, those imparting Christ’s riches to others as nourishing food. The “kitchen” in which all this food is prepared is the church. If you do not have anything with which to serve others, you may come to this “kitchen” and receive the supply. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUmKwoJQ3XNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0">RECEIVING GRACE</h2><p data-content-id="7_JcBoLt_f4p4TwS9GhdcDP6Y4eOJ0dHgTG9jncdwDuWZJuJ-gcIVOYb7Z2qhulnR"> Because our stewardship is the stewardship of the grace of God, we need to receive grace, even the abundance of grace. Yes, we all can be God’s sent ones and God’s spokesmen, but in order to fulfill such a function, we must have grace. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88597" data-verses="John 1:16">John 1:16</span> says, “For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="339" id="339">[339]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="_gz5R_nH5oLy8-la4zwars75XBAIZijurKKMBUDGJR9KRsTuy0qXMYueEupKE4DZW"> We have pointed out that all the believers are stewards. Furthermore, we as the stewards have the supply that comes from an excellent “kitchen.” But when we contact the “customers,” what shall we serve them? We need to serve them the very grace we have received. </p>
<p data-content-id="B77vULL4YXIHFFm6havIcY9xUVNW0oUVhHMvf-EO7Y7mN_8U3mz_Sb5pyhxZje63p"> Perhaps you are wondering how you can receive grace in a practical way. For this, we must get into the Word and pray with the Word. To get into the Word is to receive grace, and to pray with the Word is to touch reality. After getting into the Word and praying with the Word, we need to walk in spirit according to the Word. If we do these three things daily, we shall receive a continual supply of grace. With this grace, we shall be enlightened and shall experience the reality of God as grace. This grace spontaneously connects us to the church, giving us a vital link to the “kitchen.” In this way we become proper stewards. </p>
<p data-content-id="xOItbD1M_SnXcAkcMHRO0aDVsC_nGBIPiZ8yi6s5e1DrTLjV78UWPV1TgR921-jvh"> If we say that we are apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, but we do not get into the Word, pray, and walk in the spirit according to the Word, then what we have is just an empty title. We have no reality, and we have no way to reach the standard set by Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="rzBtTvnnp8EWQ9SXyt4WJFpSMK0wcN18pC-iFM-wWF7biwez5fLvQHeKFo4_b1dI7"> In our prayer we should not be concerned about trivial matters. For example, do not pray about a minor problem with your health or about your temper. The more you pray about your temper, the more you will be troubled by it. Pray with the Word, especially with chapters like <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88598" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span>. We should pray with the Word until it gets into us and fills us. When the Word gets into us and the Spirit fills our spirit, spontaneously our daily walk becomes worthy of God’s calling. We shall then walk in spirit according to the Word, and we shall receive grace and experience grace. By receiving grace in this way, we are brought on to the standard established by Paul. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dvx25G8sssSYMALmWN9v-wwXD3yAtwN7G3_YIZuDLoUsHACVRNy6oYa6xgCQFEpxU">RECEIVING REVELATION</h2><p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9boVFU3TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> In order to reach the standard, we also need to receive revelation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88599" data-verses="Ephesians 3:3">3:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88600" data-verses="Ephesians 3:5">5</span>). A prophet is one who is full of light, one who sees what others do not see. Those who are in darkness <span class="pg" data-page-id="340" id="340">[340]</span> have nothing to say, but those who are in the light have a great deal to speak forth. Whenever we see something by revelation, we automatically have something to talk about. If we would be today’s sent ones and prophets, we must receive both grace and revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="KinSpiWncXMNo5T64K5GnF2zjvJMCAmz0SWiBllAApDxAJJy3NRnyUU_zHhMXOBI9"> By receiving grace and revelation, we shall spontaneously become burdened to contact others. One who gets into the Word daily and who prays consistently will have a burden to speak to others about what he has seen and experienced. At the very least, he will have the desire to call someone on the telephone. Do not think that the grace and revelation you receive will allow you to remain passive or inactive. No, the grace and revelation will burden you to go to others and to minister to them. This is to be an apostle and a prophet in a practical way. It is useless for me or anyone else to charge you to be such a sent one and spokesman. The only thing that avails is for you to get into the Word, pray, and receive grace and revelation. Whenever you are enlightened by the Lord, you will be eager to tell others what you have seen. </p>
<p data-content-id="lwsB7fTo0YBNqEyc92s8YZtJauR1j2669bSShh3cXlYnPCMXGJH6EofNa-wN0fGTI"> The way to receive revelation is to get into the Word. I believe that Paul received revelation through his study of the Old Testament. Because he spent so much time in the Word, revelation could come to him by means of the Word. The Pharisees, however, could not receive revelation from the Word because they were closed and disobedient. Paul, however, was open. All the veils that covered him were taken away by the Lord. As we come to the Word, we should ask the Lord to remove the veils from our eyes. Although we do not know what veils are still upon us, the Lord knows, and He is willing to remove them. We need to pray, “Lord, I am coming to Your Word. Take away anything that veils my sight, and make Your Word open to me.” If we pray in this manner, light will come in, and we shall receive revelation. Then we shall speak to others according to the light we have received from the Lord. Such a speaking, a speaking full of divine light, will greatly surprise the religious ones. Oh, the church people must be full of light, full of revelation! <span class="pg" data-page-id="341" id="341">[341]</span> </p>

He did not put himself in a special category, in a category separate from that of the other saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="GJHsP88GHseo8rpjYyem_lGbTqQsz4KrNMLYo1DtwblC8XXjSuatQl8WDTK_MeK3O"> Grace has been given to each of us according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Each member of our physical body has a certain measure. For example, the measure of the ear is of one size, and the measure of the shoulder is of another. The words “the measure of the gift of Christ” refer to the size of a member of Christ’s Body. With every member there is a certain size, a certain measure. Just as our blood supplies the members of our body according to their size, grace also is given to each member according to its size. Although there is more blood in the shoulder than in the ear, the quality of the blood is the same. Just as blood is the life supply to our physical body, so grace is the life supply to the members in the Body of Christ.

Hence, the work of ministry is the building up of the Body. </p>

Is it the work of the perfecting ones, or the work of the perfected ones? The answer is that it is the work both of the perfecting ones and the perfected ones. The building up of the Body is not only the work of the apostles and the other gifted ones, but also the work of all the saints. I believe that the work of ministry in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88622" data-verses="Ephesians 4:12">verse 12</span> refers more to the work of the saints than it does to the work of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4OyWofBDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> The work of building the meeting hall in Anaheim is an illustration of this. Many brothers worked on the construction of the hall. But very few of these brothers were professional builders. Most of them had little experience in the building trades. The few experienced tradesmen took the lead, and gradually the inexperienced ones were perfected. Eventually, both the journeymen and the learners worked together on the building of the meeting hall. However, most of the work was done, not by the professionals, but by the learners. In the same principle, the work of ministry refers to the unique work of building up the Body of Christ. This work is the responsibility not mainly of the apostles, but of all the saints. Both the leading apostles and <span class="pg" data-page-id="347" id="347">[347]</span> prophets and all the believers, including even the smallest member, work together to build up the Body. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAz-sTlZlH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9">THE CONCEPT OF HIERARCHY</h2><p data-content-id="wZZd7ZXC7lqDMlD_3-HJuDfDU2ipKM5RxitkD5PpVOrwkpldqqeIgnRv2-Kvi2tyM"> At this point I need to say a frank and honest word about the degraded condition of today’s Christianity. Christianity has become degraded largely because of the influence of the natural concept. According to the natural concept, in any group or society there should be ranks among the people, with some of a higher rank and others of a lower rank. Ignatius, one of the great church fathers, a good teacher and a pious man, made the mistake of saying that bishops are higher than elders. He said that the authority of the elders is local, but that the authority of the bishops is regional. Through such a concept the seed of hierarchy was sown. As the hierarchy developed, there were not only bishops, but also archbishops, cardinals, and, at the top, the pope. After the Reformation, this hierarchy was not abolished. Rather, it continued in various forms in the Protestant denominations, and it still exists today. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5e-9ryI5O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6"> The concept of a hierarchy or a pyramid arrangement among the believers, fits into the natural concept. But if we have the light from the clear revelation in the New Testament, we shall see that the church is not a pyramid; it is a living organism, the Body, with Christ as the unique Head. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88623" data-verses="Matthew 23:8-10">Matthew 23:8-10</span> the Lord Jesus said, “But you, do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone your father on the earth; for One is your Father, He Who is in the heavens. Neither be called leaders, because One is your Leader, the Christ.” Nevertheless, according to the natural concept, the twelve apostles are regarded as being above all the other saints. However, if you study the New Testament carefully, you will not find very much difference between the twelve apostles and all the other disciples. The grace in the New Testament is not given uniquely to the twelve apostles, but generally to all the disciples. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88624" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span> the Lord Jesus prayed, not for the apostles, but for the disciples. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88625" data-verses="John 20:1">chapter twenty</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="348" id="348">[348]</span> of John, the Lord appeared on the day of His resurrection to the disciples. On the day of Pentecost one hundred twenty were together praying. The Spirit poured out on the day of Pentecost was poured out upon all the disciples, not just upon the apostles. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6ohyPdlgLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9">NO RANK AMONG THE BELIEVERS</h2><p data-content-id="ZF7iQ7T0lQJP8gtIC7nMKHRikLd4AgK5Boj8tqPtmmD8KvxV6FuuLU1d_HGholgwP"> In the New Testament economy there is no thought of hierarchy. On the contrary, God’s economy in the New Testament makes all the believers of the same rank. This is the reason that the Lord Jesus said that we all are brothers and that only Christ is our Leader, Guide, Instructor, and Director. Although God’s economy puts all believers in Christ on the same level, the natural concept is that in the church, as in any social group or organization, there should be a special class of leaders. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OYiZSb02SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH">THE APOSTOLIC AGE</h2><p data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2etAZK13kgmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg"> Due to the influence of this concept, a great mistake was made in the history of the church. According to the traditional view of church history, the first century is regarded as the apostolic age. This concept is erroneous. The apostolic age includes the entire New Testament age. Is the present age not part of the apostolic age? If it is not, then what age is it—the age of the clergy or the age of the hierarchy? If we are enlightened by the revelation in the New Testament, we shall see that the whole New Testament age is the apostolic age. </p>

Actually the church is not an organization. As Paul says in his Epistles, the church is the Body of Christ. Our physical body, which is a picture of the mystical Body of Christ, is not an organization, but an organism. As an organism, it is altogether dependent upon life. When the life is gone, the body becomes a corpse, which could possibly be regarded as an organization. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5tbeNC7n4bELsmeplIXgNzT2hgwzSKoF26Q5SKhmn5Z95j36NkbT_ysCBWMthTXfH">AN ORDER OF FUNCTION, NOT OF RANK</h2><p data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyFj20ioXOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi"> The concept that the church is a social organization has caused a great deal of damage. In social organizations there is the need for certain members to be on the top, to be of the highest rank. In religion this may take the form of hierarchy. But there is no hierarchy in our physical body. No doubt, certain members are above others, but this is a matter of functional order, not of rank. For example, for the purpose of function, the nose is higher than the mouth. It would be absurd to say that the nose has a higher rank than the mouth has. In like manner, our fingers are below both our arms and shoulders. But this does not mean that the fingers have a lower rank. This is entirely a matter of order according to function. How could the fingers function if they were attached to the shoulders? Therefore, in the physical body, a picture of the living organism of the Body of Christ, there is no rank nor hierarchal order, but only order according to function. </p>
<p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyTrPtHNbr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> In the past I have met some women who did not agree with Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88631" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span> about wives submitting to their husbands. Likewise, they could not accept Paul’s word <span class="pg" data-page-id="356" id="356">[356]</span> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88632" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">1 Corinthians 11</span> about the man being the head of the woman. Under the influence of the modern concept of female emancipation, they questioned why the woman had to be under the man. I answered them by pointing to the arrangement of the members in our physical body. I tried to show them that this arrangement is not a matter of rank, but a matter of function. For example, the nose is in the right place for its particular function. The same is true of all the members of the body. However, the fact that the nose is higher than the mouth in functional order does not mean that it is of a higher rank than the mouth. To consider the matter of rank with respect to the Body of Christ is to be under the influence of the fallen human concept. Many troubles and problems have been caused by this very concept. </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8rGDawpeiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> As we consider the apostles, prophets, and elders spoken of in the New Testament, we need to drop the natural concept. If we hold to our natural concept, we shall automatically think that the apostles, prophets, and elders have a higher rank. The concept of rank is altogether a natural concept, a concept foreign to the Scriptures. The apostles, prophets, and elders carry out certain functions, but fulfilling these functions does not place them on a level above the other saints. In the Body there are many members, and these members have different functions. Although there is a difference of function, there is no difference of rank. In an organism there is no consciousness of rank. If our shoulders could speak, they would say that they have never thought of having any rank in our body; they would say that they have never regarded themselves as higher than the other members. </p>
<p data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxiqwsjGWAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy"> Some of the elders have been rather proud of their position and have expected the saints to give place to them. Other brothers have been ambitious to become elders. There is no room for such ambition in the church life. If we know the Bible, we shall realize that an elder is a slave. The thought of rank must be purged away. The apostles and elders are not high officials. On the contrary, they are those who serve Christ to the churches and to the saints. <span class="pg" data-page-id="357" id="357">[357]</span> </p>

Rather, they are given for the perfecting of the saints (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88634" data-verses="Ephesians 4:12">v. 12</span>). The saints need to be perfected, equipped, furnished, unto the work of ministry. This work of ministry is the building up of the Body of Christ. Because so many saints are not yet doing the work of ministry, they need the gifted ones mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88635" data-verses="Ephesians 4:11">verse 11</span> to perfect them, to equip them, that they may be qualified to carry out the work of ministry for the building up of the Body of Christ. The perfecting or equipping is related both to growth in life and to training in certain skills. </p>
<p data-content-id="lwsB7fTo0YBNqEyc92s8YZtJYuR5h2669bSShh3cXlYnPCMXGJH6EofNa-wN0fGTI"> The light on these verses has never been as bright and clear as it is today. We have seen that the work of ministry is simply the building up of the Body of Christ. This work should be carried out not only by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, but by all the members. Hence, all the saints are building members. We are not only members who have been built up, but we are also members who build up the Body. Firstly, the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers perfect the saints. This means that they build up the saints. Then the perfected saints become the building members. In these days the saints are being perfected. But after another period of time I expect that the saints who are being perfected now will also become the building ones. </p>

However, he was waiting for the immature ones to <span class="pg" data-page-id="358" id="358">[358]</span> grow up. In other words, he was waiting until we all arrive. Paul did not want to arrive at the destination ahead of the younger ones. Rather, he was waiting until we all arrive at three things: at the oneness of the faith, at a full-grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. In this verse there are three phrases beginning with the word <em>at.</em> The fact that there is no conjunction indicates that the second is in apposition to the first and that the third is in apposition to the second. Thus, the three phrases actually refer to one thing. </p>
<p data-content-id="od6p5sc1GDqOFwWB01GI4UNhCvyh0TvvTOTFDcnJar4LT8Qnqe8UcaKDTX05Qn6K7"> Paul expected all the saints to come up to his standard and to be the same as he was. Paul was a builder, and we all should be builders also. Paul was not some great official. At most, he was simply a member of the Body. The difference between him and most of us is that Paul was a building member, whereas most of us are just builded members. Nevertheless, the day is coming, perhaps after a few years, when we all shall be building members. Then we shall all arrive at the destination together. </p>

He first needs to become a builded one. For this, a spiritual babe needs to grow. If we would be a builded member and especially a building member, we must grow. Furthermore, we need to develop certain skills. In the foregoing message we pointed out that the way to perfect the saints is to feed them so that they may grow and to train them so that they may learn certain skills. The learning of skills is related to our growth in life. The more mature we are, the more we are able to be trained. For example, an older child is able to learn more skills in mathematics than a younger child. It is the growth in life that gives us the capacity to learn certain skills. </p>

We have pointed out that the gifted ones in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88649" data-verses="Ephesians 4:11">verse 11</span> perfect the saints to do the same things that they themselves do. We all can be sent out and we all can speak for the Lord as prophets, preach the gospel as evangelists, and shepherd others and teach them as shepherds and teachers. If we love the Lord, we shall speak for Him as His witnesses. Furthermore, we need to preach the gospel, whether in season or out of season. This is not only the task of the leading evangelists, but of all the saints. Furthermore, we daily need to shepherd others and to teach them. The leading ones set the pattern for these functions, and we follow their example. Hence, all the saints can do the work of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. </p>

After the saints have been perfected, the leading ones should step aside and allow the saints to do the direct work of building. Every leading one must learn when and how to step aside.

We already have the oneness of the divine life in reality. We only need to keep it. But we need to go on until we arrive at the oneness of our living in practicality. This aspect of oneness is of two things: the faith and the full knowledge of the Son of God.

Oneness is nothing less than the Spirit Himself. If there were no Spirit, then there would be no oneness. Although we have the oneness in reality, there is still the need for the oneness of practicality. This means that the oneness of reality must be practiced; that is, it must become the oneness in practice. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88658" data-verses="Ephesians 4:13">verse 13</span> Paul speaks of the oneness of practicality. </p>

This work of perfecting will cause them to care for the oneness of the Spirit and to lay aside the divisive doctrines. As they arrive at the oneness of the faith, they no longer care for the various divisive doctrines but care only for the unique faith concerning Christ and His redemptive work. By the perfecting work they also arrive experientially at the full knowledge of the Son of God. They do not pay attention to divisive doctrines or practices but care only for Christ as the Son of God. They care for the full knowledge of the Son of God as life experientially. They desire more and more to experience Christ in their daily life. By arriving at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, these believers have not only the oneness of reality but also the oneness of practicality. Now they are able to come together without division and to enjoy oneness in a practical way. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4agGsKx5fOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1"> The oneness in the Lord’s recovery is such a practical oneness. Our oneness is the oneness of our unique faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God in our daily experience of Him as our life. I believe that most of us in the Lord’s recovery have arrived at the oneness of practicality. Therefore, we are one both in reality and in practicality. </p>

It is difficult to define these items adequately because they are all related to life and life is very mysterious. The real oneness in practicality is a matter of life. Likewise, the full-grown man and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ are matters of life. Only after our experience of life has reached a certain degree can we understand such a verse as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88671" data-verses="Ephesians 4:13">4:13</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OYnZSK52SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88672" data-verses="Ephesians 4:13">4:13</span> Paul begins with the oneness of the faith. From my limited experience, I can say that the faith here refers to Christ with His redemptive work. Hence, the object of our Christian faith is the living Christ with His work. </p>
<p data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2etAcK1qmgmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88673" data-verses="Ephesians 4:13">Verse 13</span> also speaks of the full knowledge of the Son of God. Apparently there is little relationship between the faith and the full knowledge of the Son of God. According to our experience, however, the two are actually one, for both refer to Christ. The full knowledge of the Son of God is a matter of knowing Christ as life and everything to us. In the New Testament the Lord is called the Son of God in relation to life, but in relation to His commission He is called Christ. When Peter received the revelation regarding Christ, he said that the Lord Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88674" data-verses="Matthew 16:16">Matt. 16:16</span>). Furthermore, in the Gospel of John we are told that we need to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88675" data-verses="John 20:31">John 20:31</span>). This means that we believe in the Lord Jesus for life and for His commission. To know the Lord’s commission is rather easy, but to know Him as <span class="pg" data-page-id="374" id="374">[374]</span> our life is quite difficult. This comes not by mere objective knowledge, but by experience. When we experience Christ as our life, we know Him as the Son of God. Then we have the experiential and practical oneness, that is, the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiE_pr66t8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND"> God desires that Christ be everything to us. Christ is the object of our faith, and He is also our life. If we see this, we shall begin to lay aside whatever distracts us from Christ; we shall drop everything other than Christ Himself. How much we drop depends on our experience of Christ. The more we experience Christ as life, the more things we shall lay aside. In this way we arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="P5LAppNM9anuOY8qKFZGxcarwXK0NW6wXX1IPiDZBj9REBKOwCbu8774faHM2uakW"> Today, because we are still short of the experience of life, we do not have the full realization of this practical oneness. But we are growing. We cannot say that we have arrived at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, or at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Nevertheless, we thank the Lord that, in His recovery, we are on the way toward this goal. </p>

The word “that,” which may also be rendered “in order that,” indicates that the result of arriving at the three things in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88678" data-verses="Ephesians 4:13">verse 13</span> is that we are no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching. Therefore, arriving at the three things in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88679" data-verses="Ephesians 4:13">verse 13</span> has a purpose, and this purpose is that we be no longer babes. </p>

In the first stage of our spiritual life, we Christians are all babes. <span class="pg" data-page-id="375" id="375">[375]</span> </p>

The Christian life is like a journey on the sea, where there are many storms. As Christians, we should not expect our journey to be calm, with no waves or winds. The waves and the storms come not only upon individual believers, but even upon the church. There are times when the church experiences waves and is in the midst of storms. Paul’s concept here is not that we can avoid the waves and winds, but that we can be kept from being tossed by waves and carried about by winds. </p>
<p data-content-id="gBi8-OiEa7te_n7JZc2wVW6ogMFH-ZhCfpqqsc2x3FtvD6W9167GIkeZns_JUH8SK"> Difficulties and hardships are different from waves and storms. Hardships are like rocks, and difficulties are like heavy weights that we must bear. Waves, on the contrary, often come in a pleasant, appealing way and even with a sweet, loving appearance. Most of those who are tossed by waves are not tossed against their will, but are tossed willingly by waves that seem most pleasant and enjoyable to them. As they are being tossed by the waves, they have no sense of danger. Rather, they may have a sense of excitement or enjoyment. Because waves may have such a pleasant appearance, they are quite different from hardships or difficulties. Actually, few Christians are tossed by difficulties, but many are tossed by waves and carried away by winds. </p>
<p data-content-id="e7TeZuy6ip5trkTcKOr38frF8Db6mup2tVAiVqlMGn0mLpxnTuxCJvbcyNlyALCaC"> Perhaps you are wondering what the waves and the winds are. They are the various teachings, doctrines, concepts, and opinions. As the church is journeying on the sea, Satan will seek an opportunity to send in some appealing teachings, concepts, and opinions to entice the believers. His purpose in doing so is to carry them away from Christ and the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="5tbeNC7n4bELsmeplIXgNzT2ngwifKoF26Q5SKhmn5Z95j36NkbT_ysCBWMthTXfH"> At the time of Paul, certain Judaizers taught the Old Testament in an enticing manner. Their teaching was related to certain practices that had been ordained by God in the Old Testament. It was difficult for the babes in Christ to discern the subtleties of these appealing teachings. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="376" id="376">[376]</span> principle is the same today, but now there are even more distracting teachings, concepts, and opinions. All these have a pleasant and positive appearance. Otherwise, no one could be cheated by them. Thus, many today are being tossed by waves and carried about by winds of teaching. </p>
<p data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyFjw0i1VOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi"> A babe can easily be deceived or led astray. For example, children can be led away from home by someone who offers them candy or gum. Their love for candy causes them to forget everything else. Because many Christians are still babyish, desiring sugar-coated teachings, they are easily deceived. </p>
<p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyTrJtHUYr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> The only way to escape from the waves and the winds is to grow in life. As you are growing, you need to hide under the covering of your parents in the Lord. Do not care for spiritual candies, but care for the way your parents in Christ are taking. In this way you will be preserved and safeguarded. </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8rGFawAUiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> In the church life the young ones should hide under the shelter provided by the older ones. This covering is the best hiding place. On your own do not take in any concept, no matter how sweet it may seem. Whenever you are tempted in this way, you should say, “I don’t care for these sweet things. I care for Christ, for the church, and for the shelter of the older ones.” If you take in the candy, you will discover that there is poison under its sugar coating. </p>
<p data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxiq2sjrdAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy"> By reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88684" data-verses="Ephesians 4:14">verse 14</span> in its context we see that the most reliable test to expose any deceptive teaching is Christ and the church. In his subtlety, the enemy, Satan, uses waves and winds to distract the saints from Christ and the church. At times, Satan will even use the Bible to do this. This indicates that even scriptural teachings may be used by Satan to carry us away from God’s purpose. Satan can use almost anything to distract us from Christ and the church. He used even the words of Scripture to tempt the Lord Jesus in the wilderness. There is no better safeguard than Christ with the church. Do not accept any teaching that cannot pass the test of Christ and the church. </p>

Hence, to them speaking the truth is in contrast to telling lies. I do not say that this understanding is wrong. However, if we consider this verse in its context, we shall see that in its spiritual meaning a great deal more is involved here than merely speaking truth instead of lies. </p>

The word truth in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88694" data-verses="Ephesians 4:15">verse 15</span> denotes that which is real. In this universe the real things, the true things, are Christ and <span class="pg" data-page-id="382" id="382">[382]</span> the church. Only by speaking concerning Christ with the church do we actually handle the truth. This means that although we may refrain from telling lies, we still may not be speaking the truth. For example, certain reports in the newspapers may not be lies; however, these reports are not the truth, the reality. On the contrary, they are vanity. Anything apart from Christ with the church is a vanity and a falsehood. If I am a person without Christ, my very being is vanity. A person may be extremely wealthy and possess an abundance of material things, but if he does not have Christ, all those riches and material items are nothing but vanity. The book of Ecclesiastes says that all is vanity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88695" data-verses="Ecclesiastes 1:2">1:2</span>). Apart from Christ with the church, nothing is true, nothing is real. To those who love the Lord Jesus and who are for today’s church life, the only reality in the universe is Christ with the church. Day by day, we may talk about many things. But if we do not speak concerning Christ and the church, we are handling vanity; we are not handling the truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="uRn6e8DCDhYvxWArZZyg1AAdWPaevbWQ-S4ajELiYI6nagGr9Sjsomhlk1pMnAffa"> Instead of being carried about by winds of teaching, we should handle the truth and embrace it. Suppose someone comes to you advocating a particular doctrine, such as the doctrine of foot-washing. Although his particular teaching may be true, even this true teaching can distract you from Christ and the proper church life. Thus, even something such as foot-washing may become a falsehood, a vanity. I know of a brother who became distracted and eventually dissenting over this very thing. This indicates that we may talk about scriptural doctrines but still not be handling the truth. </p>

The first item of truth in this chapter is the oneness in two aspects: the oneness of the Spirit and oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. If you truly desire to handle the truth and to speak the truth, you must care for the oneness of the Spirit and the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. Furthermore, you must take care of Christ, who is the center of God’s New Testament economy. God’s economy today is nothing less <span class="pg" data-page-id="383" id="383">[383]</span> than Christ with His Body. However, many Christians care neither for the Head nor for the Body. Instead, they are occupied by secondary teachings. To neglect Christ as the Head and the church as the Body and to speak about secondary matters is not handling the truth. This is not the speaking of the truth; it is the speaking of vanity. </p>

No doubt these waves and winds refer to various teachings and practices. Although these teachings may be scriptural or fundamental, they do not minister Christ to people. Their effect is to distract people from Christ and the church. Others may be tossed or carried about by such teachings, but we must hold to the truth in love; that is, we must hold to Christ and the church. This is what we speak, and this is our fellowship. It should even be the focal point of our prayer. </p>

They walk without God in the vanity of their mind and are controlled and directed by their vain thoughts. Whatever they do according to their fallen mind is vanity; it is all without reality. The life of fallen mankind is a walk in the vanity of the mind. All the worldly people today walk in such vanity. In the eyes of God and in the eyes of the Apostle Paul, whatever the people in the world think, say, and do is nothing but vanity. None of those things is real or solid—everything is empty. As believers, we should no longer walk in the vanity of the mind. Instead, we must walk in the reality of our spirit. </p>

Estranged from the Life of God</h2><p data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fBNTNPMTEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z"> The nations are also “estranged from the life of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88722" data-verses="Ephesians 4:18">v. 18</span>). This life is the uncreated, eternal life of God, which man did not receive at the time of creation. After being created, man with the created human life was placed before the tree of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88723" data-verses="Genesis 2:8-9">Gen. 2:8-9</span>) to receive the uncreated divine life. But man fell into the vanity of his mind and became darkened in his understanding. In such a fallen condition, man is not able to touch the life of God until he has his mind turned to God, until he repents and believes in the Lord Jesus to receive God’s eternal life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88724" data-verses="Acts 11:18">Acts 11:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88725" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="inTRR5aqA6f3Zp0g5VCt5vCsixBsUPP9fz0SGMS6TD8Ev1RYK0XGG-yq2bZI5h3Uz"> God’s intention in His creation of man was that man would partake of the fruit of the tree of life and thereby receive the eternal life of God. But in the fall, Satan’s evil nature was injected into man. As a result, man had to be barred from the tree of life. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88726" data-verses="Genesis 3:24">Genesis 3:24</span>, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="391" id="391">[391]</span> Lord “drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.” Thus, man was estranged from the life of God. The cherubim, the flame, and the sword signify God’s glory, holiness, and righteousness. These three things kept sinful man from receiving eternal life. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He fulfilled all the requirements of God’s glory, holiness, and righteousness. Therefore, through the redemption of the Lord Jesus, the way has been opened for us to contact the tree of life once more. This is the reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88727" data-verses="Hebrews 10:19">Hebrews 10:19</span> says that we have “boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus.” The tree of life is in the Holy of Holies. As believers in Christ, we have been brought back to the tree of life. Now the divine life in the Holy of Holies may be our daily enjoyment. The nations, however, are still estranged from the life of God. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQweI9Prddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_">1. Because of the Ignorance Which Is in Them</h2><p data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bDPsOVJa0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D"> One reason for this estrangement is “the ignorance which is in them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88728" data-verses="Ephesians 4:18">v. 18</span>). Ignorance here means not only lack of knowledge, but also not wanting to know. Fallen man does not approve of knowing the things of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88729" data-verses="Romans 1:28">Rom. 1:28</span>) because of the hardness of his heart. Due to this, his understanding is darkened that he cannot know God. </p>
<p data-content-id="jzy56D5a4K14njv2OL9Qfpn893HnB1Ab9R3e21WSu1YH0DQn4sk-OuELvP5dRJ2jv"> The unbelievers have no knowledge of God or of spiritual things. Furthermore, they are not willing to gain this knowledge. What a mercy that we not only have the proper knowledge, but also have the desire to know! It is a great blessing to have within us the desire to know God, to know life, and to know spiritual things. Before we were saved, we did not have this desire. We, like the nations, lacked both the knowledge and the willingness to know. But now we hunger and thirst to know God. The more we can know of Him and of the divine life, the better it is. Any Christian who does not seek to know the Lord cannot be happy or satisfied. To seek the Lord and to seek to know life and the things of God is a source of great happiness. This is the reason we are so happy in the church meetings. It is also the reason that I have an <span class="pg" data-page-id="392" id="392">[392]</span> inward joy when I minister the Word to the Lord’s people. Something of the Lord has been sown into us to give us the desire to know Him. </p>

Because of the Hardness of Their Heart</h2><p data-content-id="nFupmXdU7v_F8Wz3VyT4gw69JecaBqgfhZHMQs6SxdJFG3VrWN2G3kyhCMk9WVErP"> Another reason the nations are estranged from the life of God is the hardness of their heart. The hardness of fallen man’s heart is the source of the darkness in his understanding and the vanity of his mind. Before we were saved, we also were hard of heart. We seemed to be impenetrable, and God’s words could not enter into us. This is the situation of unbelievers today. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR08eBZ6EWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB">D. Having Ceased from Feeling</h2><p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4O1WoTDDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> Furthermore, in his thorough diagnosis of the condition of fallen man, Paul points out that the nations have “ceased from feeling” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88730" data-verses="Ephesians 4:19">v. 19</span>). The word feeling here refers mainly to the consciousness of the conscience. Hence, “having ceased from feeling” means not to care for the conscience. After man’s fall, God ordained that man should be under the rule of his conscience. But rather than regard his conscience, fallen man gave himself over to unsatisfied lust. Because the unbelievers refused to care for the feeling of their conscience, eventually the conscience stopped functioning. Therefore, the feeling within them ceased. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAz-rTlVjH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9">E. Having Given Themselves Over to Lewdness</h2><p data-content-id="wZZd7ZXC7lqDMlD_3-HJuDfDT2ilMM5RxitkD5PpVOrwkpldqqeIgnRv2-Kvi2tyM"> Moreover, they give “themselves over to lewdness to work all uncleanness in greedy unsatisfied lust” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88731" data-verses="Ephesians 4:19">v. 19</span>). They are given over to lusts that cannot be satisfied. If we look at the situation in the world today, we shall see that unbelievers have given themselves over to lewdness to work uncleanness in their unsatisfied lust. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88734" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Philippians 1:21</span> Paul declares, “To me to live is Christ.” But here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88735" data-verses="Ephesians 4:20">Ephesians 4:20</span> we are told that we have learned Christ. Notice that Paul uses the past tense in speaking of our learning Christ. He also uses the past tense in the next verse, which says, “Since indeed you have heard Him and been taught in Him as the truth is in Jesus.” This matter of learning Christ as the truth is in Jesus is difficult to comprehend, and we need to consider it very carefully. </p>

According to the record of the four Gospels, the life of the Lord Jesus was a life of truth. Truth is the shining of light. Light is the source, and truth is its expression. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88747" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span> says, the Lord Jesus is the effulgence of God’s glory. This means that He is the shining of God who is light. Because in every aspect of the Lord’s living on earth there was the shining of light, His life was a life of truth, a life of the shining of God Himself. That life of truth was the very expression of God. For this reason Paul says that we learn Christ as the truth is in Jesus. In other words, we learn Christ according to the mold of the life of Jesus. The mold of the life of Jesus is the truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="KinSpiWncXMNo5T64K5GnF2zkvJdBAmz0SWiBllAApDxAJJy3NRnyUU_zHhMXOBI9"> After Christ established this mold, He passed through death and resurrection, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. As such a Spirit, He comes into us to be our life. When we believed in Him and were baptized, God put us into Him as the mold, just as dough is placed into a mold. By being put into the mold we learned the mold. This means that by being put into Christ, we learn Christ. On the one hand, God put us into Christ; on the other hand, Christ has come into us to be our life. Now we may live by Him according to the mold in which we have been placed by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="lwsB7fTo0YBNqEyc92s8YZtJduRkp2669bSShh3cXlYnPCMXGJH6EofNa-wN0fGTI"> Not many of us may realize the influence the four Gospels have on us. When we read in the Gospels of the mold formed by the Lord Jesus, that mold spontaneously influences our living. As we love the Lord, contact Him, and pray to Him, we automatically live Him according to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="398" id="398">[398]</span> mold described in the Gospels. In this way we are shaped, conformed, to the image of this mold. This is what it means to learn Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="ORuveXsLSL_KAUQRmmsRwUA_hxfQpsZhadewDeZFVr0RNBcjRKpEUgJ7ZofkxfD26"> Learning Christ in this way is altogether different from taking Him as an objective example and endeavoring in our natural life to imitate Him. God has put us into the mold formed by the life of Jesus on earth. Simultaneously, Christ as the life-giving Spirit has come into our being as life. The more we love Him and contact Him, the more we live Him according to this mold. As a result, we are spontaneously conformed to the image of that mold. Therefore, with Paul we can say, “For to me to live is Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88748" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Phil. 1:21</span>). We live Christ in the form of His own life, in the form recorded in the Gospels. </p>
<p data-content-id="4hu3V9NSxOD4qIDQx-aI8nyPIXQlfHAukquOkznsExY9T1eCWD6YHuZmIvOhld_9j"> We must distinguish this kind of living from that according to the modernistic teaching regarding imitating Christ as our example. The modernists falsely teach that Christ is not God, but a man who established the highest standard for us to follow. This teaching requires that we exercise our natural life to imitate Christ and to live up to His standard. Such a teaching is heretical. It has absolutely nothing to do with the truth as it is in Jesus. It denies the fact that a true believer is in Christ and has Christ in him. In contrast to this heretical, modernistic teaching, we say according to the New Testament that when a sinner repents and believes in Christ and is baptized into Christ, God puts this one into Christ as the mold. At the same time, Christ as the life-giving Spirit comes into him to be his life. Thereafter, this believer is to live by Christ as his life according to the mold. The more he lives by Christ, the more he will be spontaneously shaped into the form of the mold. This is a life in Christ and also a life of Christ in us. We are in Christ as the mold, and He is in us as our life. In this way we learn Christ as the truth is in Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="od6p5sc1GDqOFwWB01GI4UNhHvyA7TvvTOTFDcnJar4LT8Qnqe8UcaKDTX05Qn6K7"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88749" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">Ephesians 4</span> covers three items concerning a life worthy of God’s calling: keeping the oneness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88750" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1-14">vv. 1-14</span>), growing up into the Head (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88751" data-verses="Ephesians 4:15-16">vv. 15-16</span>), and learning Christ as the <span class="pg" data-page-id="399" id="399">[399]</span> truth is in Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88752" data-verses="Ephesians 4:17-32">vv. 17-32</span>). Concerning the learning of Christ as the truth is in Jesus, Paul firstly exhorts us and testifies to us that we should no longer walk as the Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88753" data-verses="Ephesians 4:17">v. 17</span>). Instead, we should walk in the life that is according to the truth in Jesus. The Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind, but we walk in the reality expressed in the life of Jesus recorded in the Gospels. In His life we see reality, truth, the shining of light, the expression of God. As the believers in Christ, we are to walk in such a reality. </p>

We were taught this when we were put into the mold, that is, when we were baptized. In baptism we were taught that our old man has been crucified and that he is to be buried by baptism. Furthermore, we were taught that as we come out of the water, we are resurrected into the new man. Therefore, by baptism we were taught that we have put off the old man and have put on the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="bx_UdsKHw-vHF3mnF2hC5zElrzAlAWM1-A9auvEbkRZG4a2E4SntYRIkifhdfEuRY"> At this point we need to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88757" data-verses="Romans 6:3-5">Romans 6:3-5</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88758" data-verses="Romans 6:3">Verse 3</span> says, “Are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?” To be baptized into Christ Jesus means to be put into Him. Furthermore, through baptism we have been buried into Christ’s death. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88759" data-verses="Romans 6:4-5">verses 4 and 5</span> we see the mold. These verses indicate that through baptism we were taught that we have put off the old man and have put on the new man. This is the normal Christian experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="qrCoreirL3MU0e6xc6vji8PNuGrIvz5zIOcWFV4v-HiHK0TVU2I9mwTIzwi4vYBpQ"> Normally, as we preach the gospel to sinners, we tell them of the life, death, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Then we encourage those who are willing to believe in Christ to receive Him into them as their life. The next step is to baptize them. This indicates that we put them into Christ as the mold. Thereafter, they are to live by Christ according to the mold. By baptism they have been taught that they have put off the old man and have put on the new man. By being buried through baptism, they learned Christ as the truth is in Jesus. <span class="pg" data-page-id="400" id="400">[400]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="yso9Pxvovo30rgMfTrxdwDtYQBNZgZ3STh7ddBjVVV-UFyNUyESGMFZxFx7YtQwo0"> We should not try to understand verses such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88760" data-verses="Ephesians 4:20-24">4:20-24</span> through the exercise of our natural mind. Rather, we need to consider them in the light of our Christian experience. If we do this, the light will gradually shine upon us, and we shall see the truth. The truth here is that when we were baptized, we were taught that we have put off the old man and that we have put on the new man. Notice that Paul does not say that we have been taught <em>to</em> put off the old man and <em>to</em> put on the new man. No, we have already put off the old man and have put on the new man. Our old man was buried in the waters of baptism. Hence, we have put off the old man. Furthermore, as we rose up from the water in resurrection, we were clothed with the new man. Hence, we have also put on the new man. Therefore, we have been taught in Christ as the truth is in Jesus that we have put off the old man and put on the new man. </p>

This is utterly different from the devilish, modernistic teaching which says that Christ established the highest standard of human living and that we must endeavor to copy Him and to live up to this standard.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88784" data-verses="Ephesians 4:17-24">4:17-24</span> Paul gives us the basic principles for the living needed in our daily walk. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88785" data-verses="Ephesians 4:22">verses 22</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88786" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">24</span> we see that the condition for learning Christ is having put off the old man and having put on the new man. Once this condition is met, it is possible for us to live a life of truth, which is the expression of God in the shining of light. </p>

A LIVING OF LEARNING CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="S26jTFFVZnj955_hMlMnIhY84MxpvdPkCD61VuHGKt4L3wCMJyIZ3UBt_LzbPLTVG"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88787" data-verses="Ephesians 4:25-32">verses 25 through 32</span> we have a description of the practical daily life in the learning of Christ. In covering the daily life of learning Christ, Paul goes into a lot of detail. He mentions things such as anger, stealing, bitterness, wrath, clamor, evil speaking, malice, tenderheartedness, and forgiveness. Although these details are easy to see, it is more difficult to discern two important matters that Paul’s speaking is based upon. These matters are truth and grace. The apostle’s exhortation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88788" data-verses="Ephesians 4:17-32">verses 17 through 32</span> takes truth and grace as its basic elements (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88789" data-verses="Ephesians 4:21">vv. 21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88790" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88791" data-verses="Ephesians 4:25">25</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88792" data-verses="Ephesians 4:29">29</span>). He wants us to live as Jesus did, a life full of grace and truth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88793" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88794" data-verses="John 1:17">17</span>). Grace is God given to us for our enjoyment, and truth is God revealed to us as our reality. When we live and speak truth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88795" data-verses="Ephesians 4:21">Eph. 4:21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88796" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">24</span>), we express God as our reality, and others receive God as grace for their enjoyment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88797" data-verses="Ephesians 4:29">v. 29</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="gBi8-OiEa7te_n7JZc2wVW6osMFexZhCfpqqsc2x3FtvD6W9167GIkeZns_JUH8SK"> In the New Testament grace and truth are a pair. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88798" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and truth, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88799" data-verses="John 1:17">verse 17</span> says that grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="406" id="406">[406]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="e7TeZuy6ip5trkTcKOr38frFwDbfqup2tVAiVqlMGn0mLpxnTuxCJvbcyNlyALCaC"> Just as grace and truth are a pair, so love and light are also a pair. In the Gospel of John we have grace and truth, but in the First Epistle of John we have love and light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88800" data-verses="1John 4:16">4:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88801" data-verses="1John 1:5">1:5</span>). Grace is the expression of love, and love is the source of grace. In the same principle, truth is the expression of light, and light is the source of truth. In God’s heart there is love. When this love is expressed, it becomes grace. Likewise, with God there is light. When the light shines forth, it becomes truth. When we trace grace and truth back to their source in God, we are in love and light. </p>
<p data-content-id="5tbeNC7n4bELsmeplIXgNzT2rgwDSKoF26Q5SKhmn5Z95j36NkbT_ysCBWMthTXfH"> We have pointed out that Paul’s exhortation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88802" data-verses="Ephesians 4:17-32">4:17-32</span> covers both truth and grace. Truth is clearly mentioned, but grace is somewhat hidden, being especially implied in Paul’s mention of the details related to daily living. If we are short of grace, we cannot meet the standard in relation to these details. The principles for our learning of Christ are related to the truth, whereas the details are related to grace. If we would be conformed to the image of Christ, that is, if we would learn Christ, we need both the principles and the details. If we have the truth, we have the principles. If we have grace, we shall succeed in meeting the standard in all the details. </p>
<p data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bDPiOVJS0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D"> Paul says that we learn Christ as the truth is in Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88803" data-verses="Ephesians 4:21">4:21</span>). The pattern, the mold, set up by the Lord Jesus is the truth. The truth is the principle, the principle is the pattern, and the pattern is a matter of having put off the old man and of having put on the new man. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88804" data-verses="Ephesians 4:17-24">verses 17 through 24</span> we have the principle of our renewed daily living for the learning of Christ. This principle is the truth, the living of the Lord Jesus when He was on earth. The Lord’s living was that of always putting off His own life and of putting on the Father’s life. This is the life of Jesus, and this life is the truth that is the principle of a life of learning Christ. According to this principle, we have put off the old man and have put on the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="jzy56D5a4K14njv2OL9Qfpn8z3HnJ1Ab9R3e21WSu1YH0DQn4sk-OuELvP5dRJ2jv"> Every aspect of our daily living should be governed by this principle, not by a standard of ethics. For example, our conversation should be governed not by a standard of ethics, <span class="pg" data-page-id="407" id="407">[407]</span> but by the New Testament principle of having put off the old man and of having put on the new man. Even how much we laugh or cry should be determined by the principle of having put off the old man and of having put on the new man. This principle is much higher than any ethical standard. </p>
<p data-content-id="TS0vLm3wTVrzuTUulNHSpsNa-UDS2c-25mTg4xYz74KQnIYS77RmuCw_eSmkzr8AS"> In baptism we put off the old man and put on the new man, which is the church life. Now our daily living in the church life is to be according to the principle of truth, according to the pattern of the life of truth set up by the living of the Lord Jesus. We have been taught according to this principle as the truth is in Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="nFupmXdU7v_F8Wz3VyT4gw69HecWDqgfhZHMQs6SxdJFG3VrWN2G3kyhCMk9WVErP"> The details of our daily living are related to grace. In every aspect of our daily living, we need grace. Grace is God Himself in Christ as our enjoyment. We need to allow this enjoyment to remove from us the negative elements mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88805" data-verses="Ephesians 4:31">verse 31</span>. One of these negative elements is bitterness. Without grace, we cannot let go of our bitterness. But when we have God in Christ as our enjoyment, our bitterness will disappear. When we have sufficient grace, we can say, “I am filled with Christ as my enjoyment. Because I am filled to the brim with grace, there is no room in me for bitterness of any kind.” </p>
<p data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR08QBZ2CWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB"> Only when we are filled with grace will the negative things be removed from us. Take gossip as an example. We enjoy gossiping because we are short of grace. If we are filled with grace, we shall not seek satisfaction in gossiping. On the contrary, we shall be content with the satisfaction that is in Christ. When we are filled with grace and when Christ is everything to us, we have no need to find satisfaction in other things. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4O7WofFDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> Only by grace can we have a life that is according to the divine standard in all the details mentioned by Paul in these verses. If we are filled with grace, then in the place of bitterness, wrath, anger, and clamor, we shall have kindness, patience, mercy, forgiveness, and love. These qualities come not from self-effort, but from Christ as our enjoyment. When Christ is our enjoyment, we have no appetite for bitterness, wrath, anger, or clamor. Instead, we desire to have kindness, <span class="pg" data-page-id="408" id="408">[408]</span> patience, endurance, gentleness, mercy, love, and various other virtues and qualities. What a difference it makes in our daily living when we are happy and satisfied through the enjoyment of God in Christ as grace! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAz-lTlZhH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9">II. HAVING PUT OFF THE FALSEHOOD</h2><p data-content-id="wZZd7ZXC7lqDMlD_3-HJuDfDd2ipOM5RxitkD5PpVOrwkpldqqeIgnRv2-Kvi2tyM"> Let us now consider the details of a living of learning Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88806" data-verses="Ephesians 4:25">verse 25</span> Paul says, “Wherefore, having put off the falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor, for we are members one of another.” Falsehood here refers to anything that is false in nature. As we have put off the old man, we have also put off everything false. If we have the enjoyment of Christ, then in a practical way in our daily living we shall put off every false thing. The most honest and faithful people are those who have the full enjoyment of Christ. When we are filled to the brim with Christ, all falsehood will be put away from us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5e-0ryI1O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6">III. SPEAKING TRUTH EACH ONE WITH HIS NEIGHBOR</h2><p data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6oh7PdlsLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9"> Having put off the falsehood, we should speak truth each one with his neighbor. When we are filled with Christ, our speaking will be of things that are true. In our speaking there will be no lies and no vanity. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZF7iQ7T0lQJP8gtIC7nMKHRitLd0GgK5Boj8tqPtmmD8KvxV6FuuLU1d_HGholgwP">IV. BEING ANGRY AND NOT SINNING</h2><p data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OYrZSXy2SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88807" data-verses="Ephesians 4:26-27">Verses 26 and 27</span> say, “Be angry, and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation, neither give place to the Devil.” Anger itself is not sin, but it is dangerously close to sin. We should not continue in anger, but rather relinquish our anger before the sun sets. </p>
<p data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2etAQK17ugmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg"> According to the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus sometimes was angry. But His anger was always under control. Hence, He could be angry and not sin. It must be the same with us in our daily living. Our anger must be under control. Otherwise, serious damage will result. In order to control our anger, we need much grace. The more we enjoy Christ, the more our anger will be limited and controlled. <span class="pg" data-page-id="409" id="409">[409]</span> </p>

The condition is a matter of having put off the old man and of having put on the new man. The living of learning Christ is a matter of applying the principle of truth and of living according to grace. In this message we shall present a summary of learning Christ. This summary includes truth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88821" data-verses="Ephesians 4:21">4:21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88822" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88823" data-verses="Ephesians 4:25">25</span>) and grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88824" data-verses="Ephesians 4:29">v. 29</span>) as the basic elements and the life of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88825" data-verses="Ephesians 4:18">v. 18</span>), the Spirit of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88826" data-verses="Ephesians 4:30">v. 30</span>), and the Devil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88827" data-verses="Ephesians 4:27">v. 27</span>) as the basic factors. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fBNcNPdcEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z">I. BASIC ELEMENTS</h2><p data-content-id="inTRR5aqA6f3Zp0g5VCt5vCstxBxYPP9fz0SGMS6TD8Ev1RYK0XGG-yq2bZI5h3Uz"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that in the New Testament grace and truth are a pair and that love and light are another pair. These pairs are revealed mainly in the writings of John. His Gospel speaks of grace and truth, and his First Epistle speaks of love and light. The Gospel of John tells how God came to us in the Son so that we may receive Him as grace and realize Him as truth. Then 1 John reveals that after we have received God in the Son, we may come to God the Father to enjoy Him as love and light. Thus in the Gospel of John God comes to us as grace and truth, but in the First Epistle of John we go to God to enter into His love and light in fellowship. This indicates that there is traffic between God and us and between us and God. According to the book of Revelation, the issue, the result, of this divine traffic is the golden lampstands in this age and the New Jerusalem in eternity. </p>
<p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQwRI9Wmddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88828" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span> says that the law was given through Moses and that grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="414" id="414">[414]</span> means that before the coming of Christ grace and truth had not come to God’s people. Yes, there were shadows of grace and truth in the Old Testament age, but there was not the reality of grace and truth until Jesus Christ appeared. When Christ came, grace and truth came also. </p>
<p data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bDPjOVsY0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D"> The Gospel of John reveals how God came to man through incarnation. The Word which was with God and which was God became flesh and tabernacled among us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88829" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88830" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88831" data-verses="John 1:14">Verse 14</span> says that this incarnated One was full of grace and truth. It does not say that He was full of power and authority, majesty and sovereignty, or love and light. Many Christians quote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88832" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> without knowing the meaning of grace and truth. Grace and truth are intimately related to God Himself. Grace is something sweet, and truth is something real. Grace is actually the sweet Person of the Lord Jesus, who is the embodiment of the fullness of God and the effulgence of the divine glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88833" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88834" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">Heb. 1:3</span>). This means that He is the expression of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="jzy56D5a4K14njv2OL9Qfpn8y3HGC1Ab9R3e21WSu1YH0DQn4sk-OuELvP5dRJ2jv"> The Gospel of John speaks a great deal about life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88835" data-verses="John 10:10">John 10:10</span> says that the Lord came that we may have life and may have it abundantly. The sweet and lovely Person of Jesus is the shining forth of God Himself, His very expression. As such a One, He is life to us. Life is the essence, whereas grace is the enjoyment that comes by tasting life. When we taste the sweetness of life, we experience grace as our enjoyment. Thus, life is the substance, and grace is the enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="B77vULL4YXIHFFm6havIcY9xdVNWwoUVhHMvf-EO7Y7mN_8U3mz_Sb5pyhxZje63p"> This is confirmed in the writings of Paul. Paul suffered from “a thorn in the flesh” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88836" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:7">2 Cor. 12:7</span>). This thorn may have been a physical ailment or defect. Paul prayed to the Lord three times that this thorn might depart from him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88837" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:8">2 Cor. 12:8</span>). The Lord answered him by saying, “My grace is sufficient for thee: my power is made perfect in weakness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88838" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:9">2 Cor. 12:9</span>, Gk.). The Lord allowed the thorn to remain so that Paul could have an opportunity to enjoy His grace. In Paul’s weakness God’s power, His sufficient grace, was made perfect. </p>
<p data-content-id="xOItbD1M_SnXcAkcMHRO0aDVlC_nCBIPiZ8yi6s5e1DrTLjV78UWPV1TgR921-jvh"> Grace is the enjoyment of the Triune God in all that He is to us. When He is life to us, that is grace. When He is power <span class="pg" data-page-id="415" id="415">[415]</span> to us, that also is grace. Grace is whatever Christ is to us subjectively as our enjoyment. We need grace daily, even hourly. We need the enjoyment of Christ as our life, our power, and everything to us. Grace is the Triune God becoming our enjoyment. He has come to us so that we may gain Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him. When we experience Him as our enjoyment, He becomes grace to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="rzBtTvnnp8EWQ9SXyt4WJFpSFK0wYN18pC-iFM-wWF7biwez5fLvQHeKFo4_b1dI7"> We come now to the matter of truth. Because our mind may be preoccupied with natural concepts of truth, we may find it difficult to understand the meaning of truth according to the New Testament. Many regard truth merely as doctrine. Whenever they see the word truth in the Bible, they automatically interpret it as doctrine. However, in the New Testament, truth does not denote doctrine. If you want proof of this, try substituting doctrine for truth in various verses where truth is mentioned. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88839" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> would then say that the Word became flesh, full of grace and doctrine; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88840" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span>, that grace and doctrine came through Jesus Christ; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88841" data-verses="John 14:6">John 14:6</span>, that the Lord is the way, the doctrine, and the life. How ridiculous! It is absurd to say that we have learned Christ as the doctrine is in Jesus. Nevertheless, in the concept of many believers, truth means nothing more than doctrine. Others regard truth as sincerity. According to this understanding, to speak in truth is to speak in sincerity. </p>
<p data-content-id="dvx25G8sssSYMALmWN9v-wwXK3yApwN7G3_YIZuDLoUsHACVRNy6oYa6xgCQFEpxU"> If we would know the meaning of truth in the New Testament, we need to lay aside these definitions. Truth is God revealed. How much different this is from saying that truth is doctrine or sincerity! In principle, because grace and truth have come through Jesus Christ, they must be something of God Himself. Jesus is God coming to us. When God comes to us, He does not come as doctrine or sincerity. When He comes, everything related to His being also comes. God comes to us for our enjoyment. This is grace. God also comes to reveal Himself to us. This is truth. In other words, when God is enjoyed by us, He is grace. But when God is revealed to us, He is truth. Truth, therefore, is God revealed to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9bhVFU7TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> These definitions of grace and truth can be applied to almost every case recorded in the four Gospels, especially <span class="pg" data-page-id="416" id="416">[416]</span> to those cases found in the Gospel of John. Let us consider two such cases, one in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88842" data-verses="John 4:1">John 4</span> and the other in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88843" data-verses="John 8:1">John 8</span>. In both chapters truth is mentioned (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88844" data-verses="John 4:23-24">4:23-24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88845" data-verses="John 8:32">8:32</span>). As the Lord Jesus was going from Judea into Galilee, “He had to pass through Samaria” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88846" data-verses="John 4:4">John 4:4</span>) in order to meet a certain immoral Samaritan woman, who came to the well to draw water. Wearied from His journey, the Lord sat down by the well and waited for this Samaritan woman to appear. When the Lord Jesus asked her for a drink, she was surprised that a Jew would ask a drink from a Samaritan woman. The Lord replied, “If you knew the gift of God, and Who it is that says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88847" data-verses="John 4:10">v. 10</span>). After she questioned Him further, the Lord answered, “Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88848" data-verses="John 4:13-14">vv. 13-14</span>). What grace He showed toward her! After the Samaritan woman tasted the grace of God, she came to realize something of who the Lord Jesus was. Thus God was not only enjoyed by her, but also revealed to her. When the Lord Jesus contacted the Samaritan woman, He was the embodiment of grace and truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="KinSpiWncXMNo5T64K5GnF2zqvJMOAmz0SWiBllAApDxAJJy3NRnyUU_zHhMXOBI9"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88849" data-verses="John 8:1">John 8</span> the Lord contacted another sinful woman, a woman caught in adultery. Through His contact with her, God became her enjoyment and was also revealed to her. The Lord helped her to receive Him as grace and to know Him as God revealed. </p>

AS BELOVED CHILDREN,<br/>BECOMING IMITATORS OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5e68ryV3O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88860" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Verse 1</span> says, “Become therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.” Paul’s word here is an imperative, a command. He commands us to become imitators of God. What a glorious fact that since we are His beloved children, we can be imitators of God! As the children of God, we have His life and nature. We imitate God, not by our natural life, but by His divine life. It is by our Father’s life that we, His children, can be perfect as He is (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88861" data-verses="Matthew 5:48">Matt. 5:48</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6olzPd8vLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9"> According to the New Testament, the believers in Christ are children of God. As God’s children, we have God’s life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88862" data-verses="John 1:13">John 1:13</span> says that we have been born of God. To be born of God is to have the life of God. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88863" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span> says that we are partakers of the divine nature. Because we have the divine life and the divine nature, we can be imitators of God. Imitating God in this way is much different from training a monkey to imitate a man. A monkey does not have human life or human nature. But we have the divine life and the divine nature. Therefore, we can be imitators of God. </p>

WALKING IN LOVE</h2><p data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OcjZS652SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88864" data-verses="Ephesians 5:2">verse 2</span> Paul issues another commandment: “Walk in love.” As grace and truth are the basic elements in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88865" data-verses="Ephesians 4:17-32">4:17-32</span>, so love (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88866" data-verses="Ephesians 5:2">5:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88867" data-verses="Ephesians 5:25">25</span>) and light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88868" data-verses="Ephesians 5:8">5:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88869" data-verses="Ephesians 5:9">9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88870" data-verses="Ephesians 5:13">13</span>) are the basic elements <span class="pg" data-page-id="422" id="422">[422]</span> in the apostle’s exhortation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88871" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1-33">5:1-33</span>. Grace is the expression of love, and love is the source of grace. Truth is the revelation of light, and light is the origin of truth. God is love and light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88872" data-verses="1John 4:8">1 John 4:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88873" data-verses="1John 1:5">1:5</span>). When God is expressed and revealed in the Lord Jesus, His love becomes grace and His light becomes truth. After we have, in the Lord Jesus, received God as grace and realized Him as truth, we come to Him and enjoy His love and light. Love and light are deeper than grace and truth. Hence, the apostle firstly takes grace and truth as the basic elements for exhortation and then love and light. This implies that he wants our daily life to grow deeper, from the outward elements to the inward. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5e68ryI9O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6"> Love is the substance of God within, whereas light is the element of God expressed. It is possible to sense the love of God inwardly, and it is possible to see the light of God shining out. Our walk in love should be constituted of both the loving substance and the shining element of God. This should be the inner source of our walk. It is deeper than grace and truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6olzPdlkLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9"> Paul commands us to walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and “gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88874" data-verses="Ephesians 5:2">5:2</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88875" data-verses="Ephesians 4:32">4:32</span> the apostle presents God as the pattern for our daily walk. Here he sets forth Christ as the example for our living. There it is God in Christ as our pattern since, in that section, God’s grace and truth expressed in the life of Jesus are taken as the basic elements. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88876" data-verses="Ephesians 4:32">4:32</span>, we are to forgive others as God in Christ has forgiven us. This means that God is the pattern of forgiveness. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88877" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">chapter five</span> Christ Himself is our example since, in this section, love expressed by Christ to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88878" data-verses="Ephesians 5:2">vv. 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88879" data-verses="Ephesians 5:25">25</span>) and light shined by Christ upon us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88880" data-verses="Ephesians 5:14">v. 14</span>) are taken as the basic elements. Here Christ, who loved us and gave Himself up for us, is the example of walking in love. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZF7iQ7T0lQJP8gtIC7nMKHRmlLd4EgK5Boj8tqPtmmD8KvxV6FuuLU1d_HGholgwP"> Paul says that Christ “gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.” In the Bible there is a difference between an offering and a sacrifice. An offering is for fellowship with God, whereas a <span class="pg" data-page-id="423" id="423">[423]</span> sacrifice is for redemption from sin. Christ gave Himself up for us both as an offering to have fellowship with God and as a sacrifice to redeem us from sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OcjZSbw2SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH"> In loving us Christ gave Himself up for us. It was for us, but it was a sweet-smelling savor to God. In following His example, our walk in love should not only be something for others, but also a sweet-smelling savor to God. </p>

Unbridled greedy lust is a lust full of greed and uncontrolled. Such evil things should not even be named among us, as is fitting for saints, for persons separated unto God and saturated with God, living a life according to God’s holy nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="P5LAppNM9anuOY8qKFZGxcav0XKRBW6wXX1IPiDZBj9REBKOwCbu8774faHM2uakW"> Instead of foolish talking or coarse jesting, there should be the giving of thanks.

What Paul speaks in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88883" data-verses="Ephesians 5:5">verse 5</span> we are to know both subjectively and objectively. We must realize that no fornicator or unclean person or person of unbridled greedy lust has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. In the eyes of God, a person of unbridled greedy lust is actually an idolater, one who worships idols. <span class="pg" data-page-id="424" id="424">[424]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="vNGdZHHY14iAb_v6HwIE3H6OOAnRVeE22cQi8F0_YUxRFUJ9ktsfg-XG_7irJOOpq"> In this verse Paul speaks of the kingdom of Christ and of God. The kingdom of Christ is the millennium (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88884" data-verses="Revelation 20:4">Rev. 20:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88885" data-verses="Revelation 20:6">6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88886" data-verses="Matthew 16:28">Matt. 16:28</span>); it is also the kingdom of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88887" data-verses="Matthew 13:41">Matt. 13:41</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88888" data-verses="Matthew 13:43">43</span>). The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88889" data-verses="John 3:5">John 3:5</span>) and are, in the church life, living in the kingdom of God today (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88890" data-verses="Romans 14:17">Rom. 14:17</span>). Not all believers will participate in the millennium; only the overcoming ones will. The unclean, defeated ones will have no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God in the coming age. </p>
<p data-content-id="WMnpS5Obzk_YTS3q3GOFH1SdsAwlOrnZYpJ1P_jLUOjwyCSv5ZbC6HMtrIdmASj5I"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88891" data-verses="John 3:1">John 3</span>, all those who are regenerated are in the kingdom of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88892" data-verses="Romans 14:17">Romans 14:17</span> also indicates that in the church life we are in the kingdom of God today. However, the millennium will be the kingdom in a way that is more practical than what we are experiencing in the church today. Only in the millennium does the kingdom of Christ also become the kingdom of God. Therefore, the term the kingdom of Christ and of God refers not to the kingdom today in the church life, but to the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming millennium. Today all believers are in the kingdom of God, but not all of them will have an inheritance in the coming millennial kingdom. Both the defeated ones and the overcoming ones may be in the church as the kingdom of God. But only the overcoming ones will inherit the kingdom during the millennium. The fornicators, the unclean persons, and those of unbridled greedy lust will have no share in the reign of Christ in the millennium. </p>

The sons of disobedience are the unbelievers. We, the believers, are beloved children of God. Nevertheless, some of God’s children behave as if they were sons of disobedience. Therefore, the wrath of God will come upon them. For this reason, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88895" data-verses="Ephesians 5:7">verse 7</span> Paul tells us, “Do <span class="pg" data-page-id="425" id="425">[425]</span> not become partakers together with them.” We should be good imitators of God and not be partakers of any unclean thing. </p>

This is covered by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88912" data-verses="Ephesians 5:15-21">5:15-21</span>. </p>

THE FIFTH ITEM<br/>OF THE WALK WORTHY OF GOD’S CALLING</h2><p data-content-id="WMnpS5Obzk_YTS3q3GOFH1SdtAw0ErnZYpJ1P_jLUOjwyCSv5ZbC6HMtrIdmASj5I"> To live by being filled in spirit is the fifth item of a walk worthy of God’s calling. The first four aspects of such a worthy walk are the keeping of the oneness, the growing up into the Head, the learning of Christ, and the living in love and light. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88913" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span> Paul speaks of keeping the oneness, of growing up into the Head, and of learning Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88914" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">chapter five</span> he speaks of living in love and in light and of living by being filled in spirit. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88915" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">chapter five</span> there are three crucial words: love, light, and spirit. Love and light are covered in the first fourteen verses. The next section of this chapter deals with the mingled spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="2dq7QF0hlVfHljch6uMOWbrUw8vNgD7PM_en5LHupWopm5T9JM8tlnCWOoNUSQNy6"> To be filled in spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88916" data-verses="Ephesians 5:18">v. 18</span>) is to be filled in our regenerated spirit, the human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. Our spirit should not be empty, but should be filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88917" data-verses="Ephesians 3:19">3:19</span>). All the items in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88918" data-verses="Ephesians 5:18">5:18—6:9</span> are related to the one matter of being filled in spirit. Many readers of this chapter pay attention to such details as wives submitting to their own husbands or husbands loving their wives, but they fail to see the source of all these virtues, that is, being filled in spirit. When we are filled in our spirit with Christ unto all the fullness of God, then wives will be subject to their husbands, husbands will love their wives, parents will care for their children, slaves will obey their masters, and masters will treat their slaves in <span class="pg" data-page-id="432" id="432">[432]</span> a proper way. All of these things are the issue of being filled in spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="uRn6e8DCDhYvxWArZZyg1AAZSPa7lbWQ-S4ajELiYI6nagGr9Sjsomhlk1pMnAffa"> Those from a Pentecostal or charismatic background may regard the spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88919" data-verses="Ephesians 5:18">verse 18</span> as the Holy Spirit. They may interpret Paul’s word to mean that we should be filled with the Holy Spirit and speak in tongues. But according to the Greek text, Paul here is not saying that we should be filled with the Spirit, but that we should be filled in our spirit, that is, in our regenerated spirit. Our spirit may be empty and flat, like a flat tire. If our spirit is flat, it needs to be filled with <em>pneuma.</em> We need to go to the heavenly “filling station” and get our spirit filled with <em>pneuma.</em> In this way we shall be filled in spirit. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88920" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">chapter three</span>, we are to be filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God. If our spirit is filled with the riches of Christ, we shall have no problems in our Christian life. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4agCuKxYcOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1"> We have pointed out that living by being filled in spirit is the fifth aspect of a walk worthy of God’s calling. The first aspect is the keeping of the oneness. This is for the Body life, the church life. The second aspect is the growing up into Christ the Head in all things. This is for the building. Following this, we learn Christ by being placed into the mold, the standard of a living according to the truth in Jesus. We Christians have a high standard with an uplifted principle to govern our daily walk. To learn Christ is to take Him as the standard and to take His life as the principle. Fourthly, a life worthy of God’s calling is a life in love and in light. We must live not only according to truth and by grace, but also in light and in love. We need to be those who live in intimacy with God and walk in His presence. Our daily life must be altogether according to God’s heart and in His presence. If we have these four aspects of a worthy walk, we shall spontaneously be filled in our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="4hu3V9NSxOD4qIDQx-aI8nyLOXQAVHAukquOkznsExY9T1eCWD6YHuZmIvOhld_9j"> These five items are arranged in a marvelous sequence. Firstly we keep the oneness, and then we grow in Christ. After this, we learn Christ and live in love and in light. Then we are spontaneously filled in our spirit with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God. Out of this inner <span class="pg" data-page-id="433" id="433">[433]</span> filling will come submission, love, obedience, care, and all the other attributes of a proper Christian life, church life, family life, and community life. Therefore, the fifth aspect of a walk worthy of God’s calling is the issue of the first four aspects; that is, it is the issue of keeping the oneness, growing in Christ, learning Christ, and living in love and in light. What a life we have when we demonstrate these five aspects of a worthy walk! If we are filled inwardly unto the fullness of God, there will be no problems at home, in the church, or in the community. This is the crucial point in this message. </p>

Therefore, we must walk wisely that we may redeem the time, seizing every available opportunity. If we do not seize every opportunity, our time will be wasted. Many evil things will come in to distract us and frustrate us. We may be distracted by telephone calls, letters, or visitors.

To be drunk with wine in the body causes us to be dissipated, but to be filled with Christ unto the fullness of God causes us to overflow with Him in speaking, singing, psalming, giving thanks to God, and subjecting ourselves one to another. Day by day we need to be filled in our spirit with the riches of Christ. </p>

Such speaking, singing, and psalming are not only the outflow of being filled in spirit, but also the way to be filled in spirit.

Sometimes we are inspired by singing. But on other occasions, speaking that is filled with <em>pneuma</em> may be more inspiring than singing.

In the exhortations concerning married life, <span class="pg" data-page-id="438" id="438">[438]</span> the apostle deals first with the wives, since the wives, like Eve in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88946" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>, more easily get out of line than the husbands. </p>
<p data-content-id="pUgU6yw7JGTUYrgFoe8JTp3OZQJHSv7TrTsP0dxOoJBaWmsdb5vA9y_VoOGAtYpSI"> In the same principle, Paul deals with children before parents, and slaves before masters. Regarding the relationship between children and parents, most of the problems are caused by the children, not by the parents. The children are disobedient to their parents, but, in actual practice, the parents are obedient to their children. The same is true of the relationship between wives and husbands. Husbands, in your married life, do you obey your wife more than she obeys you, or does she obey you more? Most husbands would have to answer that they obey their wives more than their wives obey them. You may think that it is not right for husbands to obey their wives or for parents to obey their children. Although this may seem backwards according to doctrine, it is true according to practice. If husbands do not know how to obey their wives, they will not have a peaceful married life. Any husband who does not obey his wife does not know how to sympathize with her and to love her. In order for a husband to love his wife, he must sympathize with her and even obey her. Only obedience can beget obedience. Only obedience can pay the price to produce obedience in others. If a husband never obeys his wife, it will be very difficult for his wife to obey him. </p>

In his exhortations concerning wives and husbands, children and parents, and slaves and masters, Paul takes care firstly of the weaker side and then of the stronger side. Those on the stronger side should not place demands on those on the weaker side. If a husband realizes that his wife is the weaker vessel, he will not be demanding of her. </p>

Most wives appreciate and respect others’ husbands. Hence, the apostle exhorts the wives to be subject to their <em>own</em> husbands, no matter what kind of husbands they are. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4agCtKx5TOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1"> Paul’s word about wives submitting to their own husbands indicates that there is the tendency for wives to compare their husbands with the husbands of others. Husbands may do the same thing regarding their wives. If we are short of grace and do not live in the light of God, we may make such comparisons. This is the subtlety of Satan to damage married life. During your engagement, you may have thought that the one you were planning to marry was the best. But after you married him, you may have begun to compare him with others. Therefore, Paul exhorted the wives to submit to their own husbands and not to make comparisons. </p>
<p data-content-id="IYKcWTBZD2wraBqVv8VOsOtbfdnZEu5Z92lk4lPzJmdAd2biN-nCndK5RLnSYtepK"> In the same principle, when Paul addresses the husbands, he exhorts them to love their own wives (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88951" data-verses="Ephesians 5:28">vv. 28</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88952" data-verses="Ephesians 5:33">33</span>). This indicates that they should not compare their wives with the wives of others. We must hate such comparisons. They originate with the enemy, Satan, and can lead to separation or even divorce. If we desire to live a life worthy of God’s calling, a life according to truth, by grace, and in love and light, we must not compare our wife or husband with others. Rather, wives should submit to their own husbands, and husbands should love their own wives. </p>

The reason the wife must submit to her own husband is that in married life he is as the Lord. I doubt that many married sisters regard their husbands as the Lord. The situation regarding married life today is deplorable, filled with disobedience and rebellion. Nevertheless, as <span class="pg" data-page-id="440" id="440">[440]</span> Christ is the Head of the church and the Savior of the Body, wives must be subject to their husbands as to the Lord. Sarah, the wife of Abraham, was a good example of this.

In addition to being the Savior of the Body, Christ is also the Head of the church. The Savior is a matter of love, whereas the Head is a matter of authority. We love Christ as our Savior, but we must also be subject to Him as our Head. It ought to be the same in the relationship between wives and husbands. </p>

According to divine ordination, the subjection of the wives to their husbands should be absolute, without any choice. This does not mean that they should obey their husbands in everything. To obey is different from being subject. In sinful things, things against God, the wives should not obey their husbands. However, they should still be in subjection to them. </p>

As the head of the wife, the husband is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="441" id="441">[441]</span> representative of the Lord. For this reason, the wife should fear the husband. </p>

However, the apostle does not exhort the husbands to rule over the wives, but to love them. In married life, the wife’s obligation is subjection and the husband’s, love. The wife’s subjection plus the husband’s love constitutes proper married life and typifies the normal church life, in which the church is subject to Christ and Christ loves the church. </p>

This aspect of the church reveals that the church comes out of Christ as Eve came out of Adam (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88968" data-verses="Genesis 2:21-22">Gen. 2:21-22</span>), that she has the same life and nature as Christ, and that she, as His counterpart, becomes one with Him as Eve became one flesh with Adam (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88969" data-verses="Genesis 2:24">Gen. 2:24</span>). The church as the new man is a matter of grace and truth, whereas the church as the Bride of Christ is a matter of love and light. The apostle’s exhortation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88970" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span> is focused on the new man with grace and truth as its basic elements, but his exhortation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88971" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">chapter five</span> is focused on the Bride of Christ with love and light as its basic substances. In grace and truth we should live as the new man, and in love and light we should conduct ourselves as the Bride of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="xOItbD1M_SnXcAkcMHRO0aDRvC_2JBIPiZ8yi6s5e1DrTLjV78UWPV1TgR921-jvh"> Many Christians know that husband and wife are a type of Christ and the church.

According to the book of Genesis, God did not create man and woman at the same time and in the same way. Firstly, God formed man’s body from the dust of the ground. Then He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man <span class="pg" data-page-id="446" id="446">[446]</span> became a living soul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88972" data-verses="Genesis 2:7">Gen. 2:7</span>). After God created man, He said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88973" data-verses="Genesis 2:18">Gen. 2:18</span>). The animals and the fowl were brought to Adam, and Adam named them. But for Adam “there was not found a help meet for him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88974" data-verses="Genesis 2:20">Gen. 2:20</span>). Within Adam there was the desire to have a counterpart, to have someone to match him. Among the cattle, the beasts, and the fowl, there was no counterpart to Adam. In order to produce such a counterpart, “the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88975" data-verses="Genesis 2:21">Gen. 2:21</span>). While Adam slept, the Lord took one of Adam’s ribs and used it for the building of a woman (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88976" data-verses="Genesis 2:22">Gen. 2:22</span>, Heb.). In life, nature, and form the woman was the same as the man. Therefore, when God brought the woman to Adam, Adam exclaimed, “This time it is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88977" data-verses="Genesis 2:23">Gen. 2:23</span>, Heb.). Adam knew that at last he had found his counterpart. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9frVFx1TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88978" data-verses="Genesis 2:24">Genesis 2:24</span> indicates that a man and his wife are one flesh. We should regard a husband and wife not as two separate persons, but as one complete person, as two halves of a whole unit. A husband and a wife as a complete unit are a marvelous picture of Christ and the church as one entity. </p>
<p data-content-id="KinSpiWncXMNo5T64K5GnF23gvJtBAmz0SWiBllAApDxAJJy3NRnyUU_zHhMXOBI9"> Because there was no counterpart for Christ in the created universe, God caused Christ to die on the cross. As He slept there, His side was opened, and blood and water came forth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88979" data-verses="John 19:34">John 19:34</span>). Because in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88980" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> the problem of sin had not come in, that chapter mentions only the rib that was taken out of Adam; it says nothing about blood. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88981" data-verses="John 19:1">John 19</span> speaks of blood, which solves the problem of sin. The water signifies the flowing life of Christ, the eternal life, which produces the church. This life is also typified by the rib. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88982" data-verses="John 19:1">John 19</span>, not one of the Lord’s bones was broken when He was on the cross. This was a fulfillment of the Scripture which said, “Not a bone of him shall be broken” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88983" data-verses="Psalms 34:20">Psa. 34:20</span>). The unbroken bone of Christ signifies Christ’s unbreakable eternal life. Hence, Adam’s rib typifies the unbreakable eternal life of Christ. It is with this eternal life that the church is built up as the Bride, the counterpart <span class="pg" data-page-id="447" id="447">[447]</span> prepared for Christ. In this building up of the Bride, Christ gains the church as a match for Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="S26jTFFVZnj955_hMlMnIhY4zMx0ldPkCD61VuHGKt4L3wCMJyIZ3UBt_LzbPLTVG"> We have pointed out that Eve had the same life and nature that Adam had. This signifies that the church has the same life and nature that Christ has. Furthermore, just as Eve had virtually the same image as Adam, so the church bears the same image as Christ. Moreover, in stature Eve was very nearly the same as Adam. This indicates that the church has the same stature as Christ. </p>

Adam and Eve became one flesh, but Christ and the church are one spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88984" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). We can say to the Lord, “Lord Jesus, without the church, You are just a half. You are not complete. Likewise, without You, we are not complete either.” Praise the Lord that when Christ and the church are joined as one, they make a complete unit! </p>
<p data-content-id="5tbeNC7n4bELsmeplIXgNzTyggwibKoF26Q5SKhmn5Z95j36NkbT_ysCBWMthTXfH"> In the church there is no place for our natural life and fallen human nature. The human life and nature are not adequate to match Christ. In order to be His counterpart, we need to be one with Christ in life and in nature. This means that Christ and the church as one unit have the same life and nature. Furthermore, Christ and the church have the same image and stature. We should not merely know this as a doctrine, but see it as a heavenly vision. We need to see why we must receive Christ as our life and partake of His divine nature and, furthermore, be transformed into His image from glory to glory. We also need to see that we must attain to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ because we are to be Christ’s counterpart. If we see this vision, we shall be able to understand the type of Christ and the church in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88985" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">chapter five</span> of Ephesians. </p>

When we are nourished, something enters into our being to meet our need. Nourishment, therefore, must come out of a supply. Without a supply, it is impossible to have nourishment. </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8rCCawMSiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> Christ nourishes the church with all the riches of the Father. Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead. Hence, all the riches of God are in Him, and He enjoys these riches. Then He nourishes the church with the very riches of the Godhead that He Himself has enjoyed. </p>
<p data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxiuxsjnbAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy"> This is proved by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88986" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>. In this chapter the Lord Jesus says that He is the vine and that the Father is the husbandman. The Father is the cultivator, the planter, the farmer. We, the believers in Christ, are the branches. The vine nourishes the branches with what the vine absorbs from the soil. God the Father is the soil, the water, and everything to Christ as the vine. The vine absorbs the riches from the soil and the water, digests them, and then transmits them to the branches. This is the nourishing. Christ nourishes the church with the riches of the Father which He has absorbed and assimilated. By nourishing the church, Christ meets the inward need of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="MiS0T4a3KCiS0HGposEC8jSAsqKJIv0mQ1p8RXf91j3qhYPyaQ4vSp2OaxeR_yzEI"> It is correct to say that Christ nourishes the church with His life and with His word. But neither life nor His word is the source. The source is the Father. What Christ receives of the Father becomes the life and the life supply which are embodied in the Word. For this reason, the Word is the word of life, even the bread of life or the supply of life. If we would be nourished by Christ today, we need to abide in Him to absorb His content into our being as life and the life supply. In order to experience this in a practical way, we daily need to contact the living Word, for the Word is the embodiment of life and of the life supply. The more we abide in the Lord and contact the Word, the more we experience His nourishing. This is the way Christ nourishes the church. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="od6p5sc1GDqOFwWB01GI4UNlEvyo7TvvTOTFDcnJar4LT8Qnqe8UcaKDTX05Qn6K7">CHRIST SANCTIFYING THE CHURCH<br/>BY CLEANSING HER</h1><p data-content-id="3GEuFAt2o9byg8MZDzK996mH4fHiPXg_LkbTuP-LW2tuU3xrWTByUo7lMUOiCI2ZU"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that the church has the same life and nature as Christ. This is revealed in the type of Adam and Eve. If the church did not have the life and nature of Christ, the church could not be Christ’s counterpart and could never be a match for Christ. If two halves of a unit did not have the same life and nature, they could not make a complete whole. Christ and the church as one entity share the same life and the same nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="GJHsP88GHseo8rpjYyem_lGfWqQkz4KrNMLYo1DtwblC8XXjSuatQl8WDTK_MeK3O"> We have also pointed out that Christ nourishes and cherishes the church. He supplies the church and cares for the church in order that the church may grow. Although the church has received Christ’s own life and nature, there is still need for supply and for care so that there may be growth. Growth is implied in the formation of Eve, who is a type of the church. God created Adam as a full-grown man. Hence, with Adam, there was no need for growth. However, Eve was built from a rib taken out of Adam’s side. This building implies growth. Firstly, Eve received the life and nature of Adam. Then she grew into a woman by being built into a woman. The reference to nourishing and cherishing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88996" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span> indicates the need for growth. Nourishing and cherishing are not related to the initial impartation of life. They are related to supplying and caring for the life that has already come into existence so that this life may grow to its full measure. </p>
<p data-content-id="cUZm3R2OO3-xg87ohmxD-0kZcbXG2m8pa3KWJwuNiJOAyh8b5NcNgFoM_6ZG01679"> Consider the vine tree as an illustration. The vine firstly receives nourishment from the soil and the water. The nourishing element is absorbed into the vine to supply life to meet the inward need of the vine. As the vine is nourished, <span class="pg" data-page-id="454" id="454">[454]</span> it is simultaneously cherished by its environment, mainly by the fresh air and the sunshine. The wind and the sun regulate the atmosphere to promote the growth of the vine. If the weather is too cold, the sun warms the vine. If the temperature is too high, the wind cools the vine. This outward regulation of the environment is what we mean by cherishing, as distinguished from the inward supply of life, the nourishing. Today Christ is nourishing the church from within and also cherishing the church from without. He supplies us with life, and He regulates the atmosphere so that we may grow properly. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y7KPbnfhmVACkNVkC3njcSpp-kicIRrpc5RUdAorxwk76X6_8r4-6ikKrq_X9AheN"> In this message we shall consider a third aspect concerning Christ and the church—the aspect of sanctifying by cleansing. Christ sanctifies the church by cleansing her (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="88997" data-verses="Ephesians 5:25-27">5:25-27</span>). The purpose of Christ in giving Himself to the church is to sanctify her, not only separating her to Himself from anything common, but also saturating her with Himself that she may be His counterpart. This is accomplished by cleansing her with the washing of the water in the Word. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="EkaMV3Soowz1Y1LdwSAggraU8cxVk6M0H0MN5WrZ4ZYcDUwX2c921mm7c4iIL8IZY">I.

In these verses Paul is saying that husbands should love their wives as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her. He did this that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of water in the Word, in order that He might present the church to Himself glorious, without spot, wrinkle, or any such things. Christ’s purpose in loving the church and in giving Himself up for the church was to sanctify her by the washing of the water in the Word. Sanctifying is by cleansing, cleansing is by washing, washing is by water, and water is in the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="XN29daXoEaiDc-NwR9H8WYCvNCQLSqlHCNZd9RwShWBkL98XRz-1aU8fWCfEcI9un"> Christ is sanctifying the church so that He might present the church to Himself. In the past, Christ gave Himself up for the church; in the present, He is sanctifying the church; and in the future, He will present the church to Himself as <span class="pg" data-page-id="455" id="455">[455]</span> His counterpart for His satisfaction. Therefore, loving is for sanctifying, and sanctifying is for presenting. </p>
<p data-content-id="kW37bRWd4n3ChsU9j6t193oSbSZGSNT7Km646Yo-l1oZoLWUehit8wxR0xamoxSLO"> The first point in these three verses is that Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her. The second point is the sanctifying in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="88999" data-verses="Ephesians 5:26">verse 26</span>, and the third is the presenting in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89000" data-verses="Ephesians 5:27">verse 27</span>. The first point is for the second, and the second is for the third. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jf0PJ3Yzh-Zban-Z3PEii4PfmX0Gx6DqyCleWzpwECAyBCCrwndk4EBUpamTJ1Vjs"> Christ’s loving the church and giving Himself up for her was for redemption and for the impartation of life. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89001" data-verses="John 19:34">John 19:34</span>, blood and water came out of the Lord’s pierced side. The blood was for redemption, and the water was for the impartation of life so that the church might come into existence. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89002" data-verses="Ephesians 5:25">Ephesians 5:25</span> we have the church coming into existence through Christ’s loving her and giving Himself up for her. </p>
<p data-content-id="ziHhFbwj9qduVCwT62zA_ZSiiUWFLVUD31ttVpb1c14zDjDyuEyTtvwQz3ufe66GN"> After the church has come into existence, the church needs the sanctifying. The process of sanctification includes saturation, transformation, growth, and building up. Although sanctification includes separation, the main aspect of sanctification is saturation. The church needs to be saturated with all that Christ is. Saturation is accompanied by transformation, growth, and building. Through such a process of sanctification with all these aspects, the church becomes complete and perfect, the reality of what is typified by Eve in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89003" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="a-sefdyyFRnPSiT6ZZ18VpqxjG9JUTLq-KbZep_8kFXpjCLum-lwALY397Cqj_hpR"> After Eve had been prepared for Adam by being built out of Adam’s rib, she was presented to Adam, the source from which she came. In like manner, the church will be presented to Christ, who is her source. This presentation will be done not by God, but by Christ Himself. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89004" data-verses="Ephesians 5:27">Verse 27</span> says that Christ will present the church to Himself glorious. Hence, He will be both the presenter and the receiver. </p>
<p data-content-id="bx_UdsKHw-vHF3mnF2hC5zEhozAlEWM1-A9auvEbkRZG4a2E4SntYRIkifhdfEuRY"> Without separation, saturation, transformation, growth, and building, the church cannot be perfected and grow into the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Only through an all-inclusive process of sanctification can the church become complete and attain to the measure of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="456" id="456">[456]</span> stature of Christ’s fullness so that Christ can present a perfect church to Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="qrCoreirL3MU0e6xc6vji8PJtGrIrz5zIOcWFV4v-HiHK0TVU2I9mwTIzwi4vYBpQ"> In these verses we have three stages of the production of the church. Firstly, the church is brought into existence. Secondly, the church is sanctified and thereby perfected and completed. Finally, the church is presented to Christ as a glorious church without spot, wrinkle, or any such thing. It is presented to Him holy and without blemish. We are presently in the second stage of the production of the church, the stage of sanctification. When this stage is complete, we shall be presented to Christ as a glorious church. </p>

<p data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUmO0oJQ_XNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0"> In this message we need to dwell on the matter of the all-inclusive sanctification of the church. In the church meetings we are nourished inwardly and cherished outwardly. We are also sanctified. Not many of us have been separated unto the Lord simply through our private time with the Lord. On the contrary, most of us have been separated from the world unto God through the help we have received in the church meetings. We need to be nourished and cherished in order to be separated from the world. As we are separated, we are also saturated. It is the nourishment that brings in the saturation. Furthermore, the more we are cherished by the atmosphere in the meetings, the more we are willing to give up the things of the world. By the cherishing we simply lose our taste for those things, for we realize that they are the very things which cause us to be cold toward the Lord. The cherishing also helps us to be saturated with Christ. This saturation spontaneously produces transformation. You may not be conscious of how much you have been transformed, but others are aware of it. They can see the change in your life and in your living. </p>
<p data-content-id="7_JcBoLt_f4p4TwS9GhdcDP-c4eCL0dHgTG9jncdwDuWZJuJ-gcIVOYb7Z2qhulnR"> Transformation does not come through teaching or correction or through chastisement. It comes through the nourishing and the cherishing. If you faithfully come to the meetings to be nourished and cherished, spontaneously you <span class="pg" data-page-id="457" id="457">[457]</span> will be separated from the world and saturated with the riches of Christ. Then with you there will be growth, transformation, and building. This is the way the Bride will be prepared for Christ. Eventually, the Bride will be complete, perfect, and grown to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Then the Lord Jesus will come and present this prepared Bride to Himself. </p>

Here we see Christ in the stage of the flesh. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89024" data-verses="Ephesians 5:26">Verse 26</span> speaks of Christ sanctifying the church, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the Word. In this verse we have Christ in the stage of the life-giving Spirit. Finally, a third stage of Christ is revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89025" data-verses="Ephesians 5:27">verse 27</span>, which speaks of Christ presenting the church to Himself in His coming back. Hence, in this stage Christ will be the Bridegroom receiving His Bride. The first of these three stages was in the past, the second is in the present, and the third will be in the future. In the first stage Christ was the Redeemer; in the second, He is the life-giving Spirit; and in the third, He will be the Bridegroom. </p>
<p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyTvItHFbr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> In this message we need to consider certain points found in these verses. However, I wish to point out that our concern is not doctrinal. In the Lord’s recovery there is no need for us to pay very much attention to doctrine. The important matter is that we see what a Christ we have and come to experience and enjoy Him more and more. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8rCEawReiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n">THE GOD-MAN</h2><p data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxiu3sj-WAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy"> Although Christ is God, He is not God only. If He were simply God, He could not be our Christ. To be the Christ to us, He had to be incarnated. Through incarnation, Christ became a man with flesh, blood, and bones. How wonderful that God put on human nature! Our God is not merely God. In Christ He has become a God-man. </p>
<p data-content-id="MiS0T4a3KCiS0HGposEC8jSAqqKsKv0mQ1p8RXf91j3qhYPyaQ4vSp2OaxeR_yzEI"> It was in the flesh that the Lord gave Himself up for us. If He had not given Himself up as a man in the flesh, there <span class="pg" data-page-id="464" id="464">[464]</span> would have been no way for us to gain Him. We are not spirits; we are flesh. Angels are spirits. God has no intention for us to become spirits like angels. God’s concern is not with angels, but with men of flesh. Nothing is more pleasing to God than a man of flesh. At times we regret that we are fleshly. However, if we see ourselves from God’s point of view, we shall realize that there is a positive aspect of the flesh. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89026" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1">Hebrews 2</span>, Christ did not take on the nature of angels, but He did take on blood and flesh. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89027" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1</span> says that the Word which was God and was with God became flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89028" data-verses="John 1:14">v. 14</span>). Great is the mystery of godliness—God was manifest in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89029" data-verses="1Timothy 3:16">1 Tim. 3:16</span>). God cannot be manifest in angels; He can be manifest only in the flesh. The portion of the angels is to behold the manifestation of God in the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fBJQNPtcEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z"> The Word became flesh and God was manifested in the flesh. Yes, we must condemn the sinful flesh. But there is also a positive aspect of the flesh. We are not spirits as angels are—we are flesh! Our Christ did not become an angelic spirit; He became flesh. The Christ who gave Himself up for us was God incarnate. </p>
<p data-content-id="MiS0T4a3KCiS0HGposEC8jSAqqKJAv0mQ1p8RXf91j3qhYPyaQ4vSp2OaxeR_yzEI"> If Christ had not put on human nature, it would be impossible for us to receive Him into us. The very Christ we take as our person is the God-man. It is impossible for us to take in God directly. Only after God has become the God-man can we take Him into our being to be our life and our person. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fBJQNPMXEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z">A PROPER HUMAN LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="inTRR5aqA6f3Zp0g5VCt5vCohxBsQPP9fz0SGMS6TD8Ev1RYK0XGG-yq2bZI5h3Uz"> Some Christians think that they should behave as if they were angels. They try to live like heavenly beings. In the eyes of God, this kind of living is abnormal. He does not want His children to imitate angels; on the contrary, He wants them to be very human. All the members of the church should have a genuine humanity. For this reason, Ephesians, a book dealing with the church, covers various human relationships: the relationship between wife and husband, between children and parents, between servants <span class="pg" data-page-id="465" id="465">[465]</span> and masters. In order to have a proper church life, we must have a proper human life. </p>
<p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQ0dI9Pvddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> The very Christ we have received and gained is not an angel or some kind of heavenly being, but a God-man. It was as a man in the flesh that He gave Himself up for us. Furthermore, it is as a man that He is able to fit into our situation and meet our need. He has put on human nature in order to be like us. Now He lives in us as our life and as our person to be manifested from within us. When a sister takes Christ as her person in submitting to her husband, her submission will be glorious, full of the reality of Christ lived out from within her. Likewise, when a brother takes Christ as his person in loving his wife, Christ will be expressed in his love for her. Such a manifestation of Christ is possible because as the God-man He gave Himself up for us. </p>

As the life-giving Spirit, He is the speaking Spirit. Whatever He speaks is the word that washes us. The Greek word rendered word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89032" data-verses="Ephesians 5:26">verse 26</span> is not <em>logos,</em> the constant word, but <em>rhema,</em> which denotes the instant word, the word the Lord presently speaks to us. As the life-giving Spirit, the Lord is not silent; He is constantly speaking. If you take Him as your person, you will discover how much He desires to speak within you. Idols are dumb, but the indwelling Christ is always speaking. No one who takes Christ as his life and his person can remain silent. On the contrary, he will be constrained by Christ to speak. As I minister to the Lord’s children, I experience Christ speaking within me. </p>
<p data-content-id="TS0vLm3wTVrzuTUulNHSpsNezUDSyc-25mTg4xYz74KQnIYS77RmuCw_eSmkzr8AS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89033" data-verses="John 6:63">John 6:63</span> the Lord Jesus said, “The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.” The Greek word rendered words here is also <em>rhema,</em> the instant and <span class="pg" data-page-id="466" id="466">[466]</span> present spoken word. This differs from <em>logos,</em> the constant word, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89034" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>. As the speaking Spirit, the Lord is speaking the <em>rhema</em> to us. Whatever He speaks is spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="nFupmXdU7v_F8Wz3VyT4gw65KecWHqgfhZHMQs6SxdJFG3VrWN2G3kyhCMk9WVErP"> If day by day there is no speaking of the Lord within us, it is an indication that there is some problem within us. If there is no speaking, no <em>rhema,</em> then in our practical experience the Spirit is absent, for the Lord’s speaking actually is the Spirit. As long as we have the Lord’s present word, we have the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit. We cannot separate Christ as the life-giving Spirit from His speaking. His presence consists in His speaking. How can we know that Christ as our person is present with us? We know it by His speaking. If we do not have His speaking within us, we do not have His presence. But if we turn to Him to mean business to take Christ as our life and our person, His speaking will begin again. His speaking is the living word, the living word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is our wonderful Christ Himself. How practical, subjective, intimate, and real He is as the speaking Spirit! </p>

<p data-content-id="nFupmXdU7v_F8Wz3VyT4gw65JecHKqgfhZHMQs6SxdJFG3VrWN2G3kyhCMk9WVErP"> God’s economy is not a religion, but a wonderful, unlimited, immeasurable, unsearchable, and all-inclusive Person, Christ Jesus Himself. Christ is the embodiment of God and the content of the church. This Christ is to be our life and our person. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR04eBZrMWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB">NOT RELIGION BUT A WONDERFUL PERSON</h2><p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4K1WoGKDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> However, in today’s Christianity God’s economy has become a mere religion. Under the influence of this religion, Christians believe that God loved the world and gave His only begotten Son to die on the cross for our sins. After Christ’s resurrection, He ascended to the heavens. Until He comes back, we are to study the Bible and follow its teachings. But teachings are not the living Person of Christ Himself. God’s economy is not a matter of religion with doctrines and teachings; it is a matter of a wonderful, living Person. Now this Person must become our person. Our need today is not to be concerned with doctrine, but to be concerned with contacting the living Christ within us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAz6rTl8tH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9">RECOVERED TO THE SUBJECTIVE CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="wZZd7ZXC7lqDMlD_3-HJuDfHT2iIDM5RxitkD5PpVOrwkpldqqeIgnRv2-Kvi2tyM"> Many Christians pay more attention to the Bible than to Christ. This indicates that even the Bible can be utilized to distract people from Christ. Surely, we believe, respect, and honor the Bible to the uttermost. But we recognize that the Bible is the revelation of the living Person of Christ. If we do not pay attention to the Christ revealed in the Bible, <span class="pg" data-page-id="472" id="472">[472]</span> then we ignore the main function of the Bible, which is to reveal this very Christ to us. How we need to be recovered fully to Christ Himself! </p>
<p data-content-id="8h6Q8qq7fu5OpgOocEN7Cqtbvk5Cf-y1o55tduWJ4FjR4dq0idwixNOYWvRUriXAE"> We need to be recovered not merely to the objective Christ in the heavens, but to the subjective Christ in our spirit. This subjective One is seeking to spread Himself into our heart. Not only is Christ our Savior objectively, but He is our life and our person subjectively. We need to devote our full attention to such a subjective Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89036" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> Paul could say, “Not I, but Christ who lives in me.” Here Paul did not speak of the life of Christ, the work of Christ, or the power of Christ; he spoke of Christ Himself living in him. Hallelujah, the very Person of Christ is living in us! </p>
<p data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUmO2oJQ3XNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that when Christ was in the flesh, He gave Himself up for us. Then in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is the One we are to take daily as our person. As the life-giving Spirit, Christ is washing us, sanctifying us, cleansing us, nourishing us, and cherishing us. We shall consider these matters in this message. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7_JcBoLt_f4p4TwS9GhdcDP-e4eOJ0dHgTG9jncdwDuWZJuJ-gcIVOYb7Z2qhulnR">BECOMING HOLY DISPOSITIONALLY</h2><p data-content-id="_gz5R_nH5oLy8-la4zwars79RBAIZijurKKMBUDGJR9KRsTuy0qXMYueEupKE4DZW"> Perhaps you have heard messages or read books about sanctification. In order to know the true meaning of sanctification, we need to contact the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit. One aspect of sanctification involves separation. To be sanctified is to be separated positionally, to undergo a change of position. However, this is not the only aspect of sanctification. In sanctification something that once was natural gradually becomes holy in nature. Hence, as we are sanctified subjectively, we become holy dispositionally. </p>
<p data-content-id="B77vULL4YXIHFFm6havIcY91SVNW0oUVhHMvf-EO7Y7mN_8U3mz_Sb5pyhxZje63p"> This aspect of sanctification can be illustrated by the process of making tea. When tea is placed in a cup of water, the water is “tea-ified.” As the water is “tea-ified,” it becomes tea-water. We can compare ourselves to the cup of water and Christ to the tea. Just as water is “tea-ified” by the element of tea, so we are sanctified by the element of Christ. Therefore, to be sanctified is to have Christ Himself <span class="pg" data-page-id="473" id="473">[473]</span> added into our being. The more Christ is added into us, the more we have the appearance, taste, and aroma of Christ. Day by day, our need is to take more of Christ as the heavenly tea into us so that more of His element may be added into our being. In this way we shall be “Christ-ified.” </p>
<p data-content-id="xOItbD1M_SnXcAkcMHRO0aDRqC_nGBIPiZ8yi6s5e1DrTLjV78UWPV1TgR921-jvh"> Suppose Christ were simply an objective Christ at the right hand of God in the heavens. Could we be sanctified dispositionally simply by trying to follow in an outward way the teachings of the Bible? Certainly not. Nothing of the element of Christ could be added into our being. We thank the Lord for showing us that subjective sanctification is a matter of having Christ added into us. The only way this can happen is by our taking Him as our life and as our person. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="rzBtTvnnp8EWQ9SXyt4WJFpWKK0wcN18pC-iFM-wWF7biwez5fLvQHeKFo4_b1dI7">CHRIST’S INTENTION IN HIS SPEAKING</h2><p data-content-id="dvx25G8sssSYMALmWN9v-wwTF3yAtwN7G3_YIZuDLoUsHACVRNy6oYa6xgCQFEpxU"> We have pointed out that when we take Christ as our person, we experience Him speaking in us as the life-giving Spirit. The Lord’s intention in His inward speaking is not simply to tell us to do certain things or not to do other things; it is to impart Himself into us by speaking to us. The more the Lord speaks within us, the more He imparts Himself into us. Whenever we tell the Lord that we want Him to be our person, He begins to speak within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9fuVFU3TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> Even if we do not hearken to His speaking, He will still impart Himself to us by His speaking. Many times we may disobey the Lord’s inner speaking, but He spreads within us a little more nevertheless. The Lord’s main concern is not with how much we obey Him, but with how much opportunity He has to impart Himself to us and to spread Himself within us. As soon as you say, “Lord Jesus, I take You as my person,” the Lord begins to impart Himself into you. However, should you change your mind and tell the Lord that you want to withdraw your promise, He will say, “Even if you withdraw your promise, I have already imparted Myself into you.” If we tell the Lord that we are not able to obey Him, He will reply, “I am not concerned whether or not you feel you are able to obey Me. I only care to be given the opportunity to get Myself into you.” Even as we are speaking <span class="pg" data-page-id="474" id="474">[474]</span> to the Lord about not wanting to fulfill the promise we have made to Him or about being unable to obey Him, He is imparting Himself into us. The more we speak to Him, the more we are “Christ-ified.” </p>
<p data-content-id="KinSpiWncXMNo5T64K5GnF23lvJMCAmz0SWiBllAApDxAJJy3NRnyUU_zHhMXOBI9"> Sanctification comes from our dealing with the living Person of Christ. I have the full assurance that those who have told the Lord that they are willing to take Him as their person cannot escape the Lord’s speaking. As the Lord speaks, He imparts Himself into us. This impartation is sanctification. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lwsB7fTo0YBNqEyc92s8YZtNcuR1j2669bSShh3cXlYnPCMXGJH6EofNa-wN0fGTI">CLEANSED BY THE SUBJECTIVE CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="ORuveXsLSL_KAUQRmmsRwUA7gxfFisZhadewDeZFVr0RNBcjRKpEUgJ7ZofkxfD26"> We come now to cleansing. In sanctification a new element is added into us, whereas in cleansing a particular element is removed from us. We all need our natural disposition to be cleansed. No matter how good or kind you may be naturally your natural disposition is a problem. Furthermore, we have the problems of our habits, customs, and self-made ordinances. All these things need to be eradicated. </p>
<p data-content-id="4hu3V9NSxOD4qIDQx-aI8nyLJXQMXHAukquOkznsExY9T1eCWD6YHuZmIvOhld_9j"> Contrary to religious teachings, we are not cleansed by self-correction. This means that we are not cleansed by dealing with ourselves in an outward way. For example, it is impossible to remove wrinkles, signs of oldness, by washing the skin outwardly. During our first period of time in the church life, we may experience a church honeymoon. However, inevitably oldness sets in and wrinkles appear. In order for our wrinkles to be removed, our youthfulness in life must be restored. As the life-giving Spirit, Christ is doing such a work of restoration among us today. Christ will not come back for a bride with wrinkles. If we would be His Bride, we must be kept up to date with Him. Wrinkles are not taken away by teaching or by trying to obey the doctrines in the Bible. Wrinkles are removed as we take Christ as our person and allow Him to live in us. It is not the objective Christ in the heavens who cleanses us; on the contrary, it is the subjective Christ, the Christ so intimate and available, who cleanses us. Whenever we contact <span class="pg" data-page-id="475" id="475">[475]</span> Him, we are refreshed, renewed, and made more youthful in life. </p>

In the first stage, the stage of the flesh, Christ gave Himself up for the church. In the second stage, He as the life-giving Spirit is sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing the church. Eventually, in the third stage, He will present a glorious church to Himself as His Bride. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiE7qr6yt8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND">HOW CHRIST PRESENTS THE CHURCH TO HIMSELF</h2><p data-content-id="P5LAppNM9anuOY8qKFZGxcavzXKMNW6wXX1IPiDZBj9REBKOwCbu8774faHM2uakW"> We need to consider how Christ will present the church to Himself as a glorious church. When I was young, I thought that Christ was merely in the heavens and that the church was on earth. My concept was that at His coming back from the heavens to the earth, He would suddenly take up the church and present her to Himself. According to this concept, Christ is far away in the heavens, and we on earth are making ourselves ready to be presented to Him. I realized later, however, that this is a natural concept that makes Christ too objective. </p>
<p data-content-id="-xjGehvejCQlzalTuo32KU2PVU96fuPgtsH4FEYaUB1lCP61PJ3xPUdWBlbNL_kSt"> God’s economy is altogether different from the natural concept and from religion. In His economy, God is working Christ into us. Eventually, Christ will present the glorious church to Himself not by coming merely in an objective way, but by expanding within us and then by coming out of us. </p>
<p data-content-id="pUgU6yw7JGTUYrgFoe8JTp3OcQJiYv7TrTsP0dxOoJBaWmsdb5vA9y_VoOGAtYpSI"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89040" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> indicates that God has not only called us and justified us, but that He will also glorify us. Years ago I was taught that one day the Lord would suddenly descend from the heavens and sweep us up into glory. But this concept of glorification is not according to God’s economy. Christ will glorify us not by descending upon us from the heavens, but by coming forth from within us. The hope of glory is not the <span class="pg" data-page-id="480" id="480">[480]</span> Christ in the heavens, but the Christ who is in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89041" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">Col. 1:27</span>). If we do not take Christ as our life and our person, we shall have no way to enjoy the glory that is within us. We need to say, “Lord Jesus, I take You as my life and my person. Lord, I offer my heart to You. Take my heart, Lord. Possess it, occupy it, and make Your home in it.” If you practice this, spontaneously you will come to know the glory within you. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vNGdZHHY14iAb_v6HwIE3H6OJAnwWeE22cQi8F0_YUxRFUJ9ktsfg-XG_7irJOOpq">THE SHINING OF THE INNER GLORY</h2><p data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR04fBZ2GWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB"> Many of us were taught that the light of God shines upon us from outside of us. Our experience of the Lord’s shining, however, is different from this. According to our experience, the light shines not from the outside, but from within us. When you take Christ as your life and your person, do not expect the heavens to open and a great light to shine upon you in an outward way. If your experience is like that of so many, the Lord’s shining will be inward, a shining from within. Such a shining is an expression of the inner glory. Our hope of glory is Christ in us. Hence, when God glorifies us, He will not need to send the glory from above; rather, He will cause Christ to shine forth from within us. This indicates that glorification is a subjective experience of the indwelling Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4K0WofBDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu">SWALLOWED UP BY CHRIST AS GLORY</h2><p data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAz6qTlZlH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9"> Contrary to the religious concept, our glorification will not be a sudden event. Rather, it will take place gradually as Christ expands within us and saturates us with Himself. Christ glorifies us as He “eats us up” little by little. We all need to be eaten, devoured, swallowed up, by Christ as the glory within us. Within us we have Christ not only as our life and our person, but also as the very glory of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="wZZd7ZXC7lqDMlD_3-HJuDfHS2ipKM5RxitkD5PpVOrwkpldqqeIgnRv2-Kvi2tyM"> We may use the metamorphosis of an ugly caterpillar into a beautiful butterfly as an illustration of glorification. A caterpillar is not instantaneously transformed into a butterfly by a beauty that suddenly descends upon it and envelops it. No, the beauty of the butterfly is contained within the life of the caterpillar. As the law of this life <span class="pg" data-page-id="481" id="481">[481]</span> functions within the caterpillar, the caterpillar is gradually transformed into a butterfly. As this process takes place, the beauty of the butterfly swallows up the ugliness of the caterpillar. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5e67ryI5O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6"> In the same principle, Christ is in us to be our hope of glory. As the indwelling glory, He takes every opportunity to expand within us. The inner glory saturates us and even swallows us up. One day our entire being will be saturated with the divine glory. On that day we shall be brought into glory in a full way. </p>
<p data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6ol0PdlgLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9"> This is completely different from the religious teaching that tells us we must try to behave ourselves until someday when we hope to be suddenly transported into a realm of glory. According to the religious concept, we must try our best to please the Lord. If we are pleasing to Him, one day He will swoop down from heaven and carry us away to glory. What a contrast between this and God’s economy! God’s economy is to dispense Christ into us. As believers, we have Christ in us as our glory. Our need is not to behave ourselves or to endeavor to please God; it is to take care of Christ as the hope of glory and to allow this glory to be our life and person. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZF7iQ7T0lQJP8gtIC7nMKHRmiLd4AgK5Boj8tqPtmmD8KvxV6FuuLU1d_HGholgwP">CHRIST COMING FROM WITHIN US</h2><p data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OckZSb02SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH"> What we have within us is not simply life or the Spirit, but Christ Himself as the very glory of God. This Christ will present the church to Himself as a glorious church. However, He will do this not in a religious way, but in the way that is according to God’s economy. This means that He will expand within us and saturate us with Himself until we have been wholly swallowed up by the inner glory. Then He will come forth from within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2etEfK13kgmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg"> Most Christians expect Christ to come from the heavens. I am very familiar with the verses which speak of this. On the one hand, Christ will come from the heavens. But on the other hand, much to the surprise of many, He will come from within us. Objectively Christ is in the heavens, but <span class="pg" data-page-id="482" id="482">[482]</span> subjectively and experientially He is in us. As the One indwelling us, He will come from within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiE7qr6ju8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND"> Since the day Christ came into us, He has been seeking a way to come out through us. It is easy for Him to get into us, but it is not easy for Him to get out of us. For example, we can easily sow a seed into the soil, but it takes time and it requires a process for this seed to grow out from the soil. Nevertheless, just as the seed eventually grows and comes out from the earth, so Christ eventually will saturate us, swallow us up, and then come out through us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="P5LAppNM9anuOY8qKFZGxcavzXKdHW6wXX1IPiDZBj9REBKOwCbu8774faHM2uakW">THE CONTRAST BETWEEN RELIGION<br/>AND GOD’S ECONOMY</h2><p data-content-id="-xjGehvejCQlzalTuo32KU2PVU9vUuPgtsH4FEYaUB1lCP61PJ3xPUdWBlbNL_kSt"> Most Christians today miss the mark of God’s economy because they are veiled by religious concepts. They simply do not know what God’s economy is. The contrast between religion and God’s economy can be illustrated by the Lord’s human living. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, the temple with all its rituals, practices, and ordinances was still in Jerusalem. In the temple the priests presented the offerings, burned the incense, and lighted the lamps. However, God was not in the temple—He was in the Lord Jesus. Sometimes the Lord stayed in the home of Lazarus, Martha, and Mary in Bethany. He visited with them and spoke with them in a normal, human way. Nevertheless, while He was in that house in Bethany, the priests continued to perform the rituals in the temple. With the priests in the temple we see the practice of religion, but with the Lord in Bethany we see God’s economy. God’s economy is to work Himself into man. His economy was carried out not in the temple, but in that house in Bethany, for there Christ, the embodiment of the fullness of God, was present. Those who worshipped in the temple were practicing their religion, but Lazarus, Martha, and Mary enjoyed the presence of the Lord Jesus. The local churches today should not be like the temple in Jerusalem, but be like that home in Bethany. This means that the churches should not be places of religion, but be places where God’s economy is being carried out. <span class="pg" data-page-id="483" id="483">[483]</span> </p>

Because the enemy has veiled these matters, not many Christians have a clear understanding of their significance. For this reason, I am very burdened of the Lord to consider them further in this message. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XN29daXoEaiDc-NwR9H8WYCvBCQWYqlHCNZd9RwShWBkL98XRz-1aU8fWCfEcI9un">THE ADDITION OF THE ELEMENT OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="kW37bRWd4n3ChsU9j6t193oSXSZfZNT7Km646Yo-l1oZoLWUehit8wxR0xamoxSLO"> God’s intention in His economy is not to correct us or to improve us. Neither is it to have good people in place of bad people. In the eyes of God, it does not matter whether we are good or bad, for the only thing of value in His economy is Christ Himself. Therefore, God’s desire is to work Christ into us. Whether we are good or bad, we need the element of Christ added into us. This involves Christ’s work in sanctifying us. Sanctification in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89048" data-verses="Ephesians 5:26">5:26</span> does not mean merely to be separated from what is common, but it means to have the very element of Christ added to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jf0PJ3Yzh-Zban-Z3PEii4PfqX0j56DqyCleWzpwECAyBCCrwndk4EBUpamTJ1Vjs"> Sanctification is not a matter of adjusting ourselves outwardly to fit into the situation of the church life. For example, a young brother may have been rather loose before coming into the church. Now that he is living in a brothers’ house he constantly reminds himself to behave properly. This behavior is not sanctification—it is religion. In the eyes of God, such religious behavior is included in what Paul calls dung (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89049" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">Phil. 3:8</span>). The Lord does not want our self-improvement or self-adjustment; He wants to saturate our <span class="pg" data-page-id="488" id="488">[488]</span> whole being with Himself. Hence, sanctification is not behavior, but the addition of the element of Christ to our being. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ziHhFbwj9qduVCwT62zA_ZSiuUWkCVUD31ttVpb1c14zDjDyuEyTtvwQz3ufe66GN">NOT DELIBERATE BEHAVIOR,<br/>BUT A SPONTANEOUS EXPRESSION</h2><p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9fgVFU_TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> As one who is familiar with both the Bible and the teachings of Confucius, I have come to realize that in their daily living many Christians live as if they were disciples of Confucius. Under the influence of the religious concept, they regard the Bible as a book of doctrines and ethical teachings. For example, a sister may try desperately to submit to her husband. In doing this, she is actually living like a follower of Confucius, all the while believing that she is being a good Christian. She explains her behavior by saying that, according to the Bible, her husband is the head and she is obligated to submit to him. Such a word sounds very good, but it is religious, for it is not according to God’s economy to work Christ into us. We all know that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89050" data-verses="Ephesians 5:22">5:22</span> Paul exhorts the wives to be subject to their own husbands. But do not forget that this follows his word about being filled in spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89051" data-verses="Ephesians 5:18">v. 18</span>). This indicates that a wife’s submission should come out of the infilling of the Spirit, not out of an outward, deliberate attempt to be submissive. </p>
<p data-content-id="KinSpiWncXMNo5T64K5GnF23rvJMKAmz0SWiBllAApDxAJJy3NRnyUU_zHhMXOBI9"> Often in Christian weddings a pastor will charge the bride and groom according to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89052" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span> regarding husbands and wives. The wife promises to submit to her husband, and the husband vows to love his wife. However, neither the bride nor the groom realizes that submission and love are the issue of being filled in our spirit with the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="lwsB7fTo0YBNqEyc92s8YZtNSuR5h2669bSShh3cXlYnPCMXGJH6EofNa-wN0fGTI"> If a sister’s submission is genuine, it will not require deliberate effort. On the contrary, she will submit spontaneously out of her experience of Christ and her enjoyment of Him. She may not even realize that she is submissive, for she submits without purposely trying to do so. Such submission comes out of the element of Christ that has been imparted into that sister. How different this is from <span class="pg" data-page-id="489" id="489">[489]</span> submitting because she has been taught to be under the headship of her husband! Such deliberate submission is religious and is not according to God’s economy. </p>

In sanctification we do things without trying on purpose to do them. They are the spontaneous expression of our taking Christ as our life and our person. When Christ is our life and our person, He lives within us. It is He who is loving and submissive. To submit because of the indwelling Christ is one thing, but to submit because of behavior or outward correction is an altogether different matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="od6p5sc1GDqOFwWB01GI4UNlIvyh0TvvTOTFDcnJar4LT8Qnqe8UcaKDTX05Qn6K7"> The leading ones in the churches should not tell others what to do. Instead, we all must be able to testify that we live, not according to outward teachings, but according to the Christ who dwells in us to be our life and our person. Our aim is not to behave in a particular way, but simply to take Christ as our life and our person. Then what we do will be the outflow of the inner life. Spontaneously, the wives will submit to their husbands, the husbands will love their wives, and the children will be obedient to their parents. However, this kind of living will not be deliberate; it will be the issue of being filled in spirit with the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="3GEuFAt2o9byg8MZDzK996mH0fH3DXg_LkbTuP-LW2tuU3xrWTByUo7lMUOiCI2ZU"> When the young people are helped by a message, they may say that they will never be the same. But even this may be religious, for the young people may unconsciously try to improve themselves. They may try by their own effort to do what they heard in that message. Striving to make ourselves different is not sanctification. </p>
<p data-content-id="GJHsP88GHseo8rpjYyem_lGfaqQ1-4KrNMLYo1DtwblC8XXjSuatQl8WDTK_MeK3O"> In order to be sanctified in a genuine way, we simply need to contact the Lord and take Him as our life and our person. We need to pray, “Lord Jesus, You are my life and my person. Lord, take me, occupy me, and possess me. O Lord, come into every corner of my heart, fill my heart with Yourself, and make Your home in my heart. Lord, I don’t care whether or not I’ll be different, and I’m not concerned about behavior. I care only that You fill me and come <span class="pg" data-page-id="490" id="490">[490]</span> out through me.” If you contact the Lord in this way, He will gradually and spontaneously be added into your being. This addition of Christ will sanctify you. </p>

This is the reason we emphasize the fact that in the Lord’s recovery we care little for doctrine in letters, but very much for the experience of Christ as our life and our person. I cannot express how heavy is the burden on my heart concerning this matter. If I can help the saints realize what sanctification is, I believe that this burden will be discharged. Please be impressed that sanctification definitely is not a matter of outward behavior or improvement. God desires to daily dispense the element of Christ into our being. It is this element alone that causes us to be sanctified. </p>

As we are cleansed, our natural disposition is washed away. Disposition is the most inward aspect of our constitution; it is the very root of our being. We were born with a certain disposition. Disposition, therefore, is altogether inward. However, character, a combination of disposition, custom, and habit, is partly inward and partly outward, whereas behavior is wholly outward. The Lord Jesus cares little about our behavior, more about our character, but very much about our disposition. As Christ is adding His element into us, He is also cleansing us and subtracting our natural disposition. His cleansing washes away the natural element from the depths of our being. </p>
<p data-content-id="S26jTFFVZnj955_hMlMnIhY44Mx4ndPkCD61VuHGKt4L3wCMJyIZ3UBt_LzbPLTVG"> We have pointed out that the Lord will wash the church from all wrinkles. Wrinkles are caused by our natural disposition. Hence, the only way these wrinkles can be removed is <span class="pg" data-page-id="491" id="491">[491]</span> for the element of our natural disposition to be cleansed away. </p>

However, if the Apostle Paul were with us, it would be difficult to discern his disposition, because he has been so deeply cleansed and purified. His old, natural disposition has been washed away by the element of Christ. </p>

Strictly speaking, God is not seeking a spiritual church, a heavenly church, nor even a victorious church. He wants a church of glory. Glory is the expression of God and it is altogether different from human morality and behavior. When God filled the tabernacle and the temple, both of them were filled with glory, with the very manifestation of God. The church should be characterized by glory—not by anything else, not even spirituality. I am not happy to hear talk about a so-called spiritual church. The only way God can have a glorious church is through Christ’s sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing. As we experience these things in a personal and practical way, the church becomes glorious. </p>
<p data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUmO5oJB8XNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0"> The Bible does not speak of a spiritual church. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89055" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span> Paul speaks of a glorious church. One of Brother Nee’s books is entitled <em>The Glorious Church.</em> Many Christians have as their goal a so-called spiritual church. Instead of seeking spirituality, we should seek to be filled with glory so that Christ may have His glorious church. </p>

In a sense, some have been helped by those teachings, but in another sense, they have been frustrated by them. Religious teachings can keep the saints from seeing the revelation of the glorious church and can cause them instead to seek such things as spirituality, gifts, and victory. Ultimately, it is not God’s intention to have a church that is merely spiritual, <span class="pg" data-page-id="496" id="496">[496]</span> victorious, or heavenly. His goal is a glorious church. Do not aspire to be like the angels. They may be spiritual, heavenly, and victorious, but they are not glorious, for they do not bear the glory of God. Praise the Lord that we who believe in Christ bear God’s glory! Religion actually brings people down to the level of angels. Under the influence of the religious concept, many Christians are envious of the angels. If we see God’s economy, we shall reject such an influence and desire to become filled with glory in order that God may reach His goal. </p>

For example, a brother may be pleased at his success in overcoming his temper. He may have been defeated by his temper for years and now at last he has gained victory over it. Such a victory, however, may be completely lacking in glory. God’s economy is not a matter of becoming victorious over such things as our temper. It is a matter of taking Christ as our life and our person and allowing Him to live in us. The result of this is the expression of God as glory. In ourselves we may be victorious, but in order to be glorious we need Christ to be our life and our person. </p>

While it is helping us, it is also deceiving us. The reason is that religion is part truth and part falsehood. This mixture of truth and falsehood is a subtle form of deception. For example, it is rather easy to preach the gospel to the heathen and to bring people to the Lord. However, it is very difficult to bring someone to the Lord who has had a background in Catholicism, for he has been cheated by the half-truths of that religious system. On the one hand, we have been helped by the religious teachings we received in the past. But on the other hand, these same teachings have veiled us in relation to God’s economy. Therefore, we need to discard religious concepts <span class="pg" data-page-id="497" id="497">[497]</span> and teachings and come back to the whole truth of the pure Word of God. </p>

He already has myriads of angels. God’s goal is to have a glorious people as His expression. In the midst of this dark, evil age, God desires to have on earth a people full of His glory. If the meeting hall were filled with angels, we would probably think that the situation of the church is glorious. We perhaps would marvel at all the spiritual, heavenly, victorious beings. However, such a situation would not be a true manifestation of God’s glory. God expresses Himself not through angels, but through man. Although we are men in the flesh, we can take Christ as our life and our person. When we do this, even the angels will marvel at the expression of glory in us. The angels may say, “Look at these people. They are full of God’s glory!” </p>
<p data-content-id="pUgU6yw7JGTUYrgFoe8JTp3OSQJHWv7TrTsP0dxOoJBaWmsdb5vA9y_VoOGAtYpSI"> Do you still desire to have a spiritual church, a heavenly church, a victorious church? If you know God’s economy, your desire will be for a glorious church. We should be able to say to the angels, “Angels, we don’t envy your spirituality, victory, or heavenliness. We have Christ within us as our life and our person, and we are being filled with glory. Angels, do you have Christ as your life and your person? Gabriel could announce the birth of Christ, but he does not have the privilege of taking Christ as his life and person. Angels, we would like to tell you that Christ dwells within us. You may be spiritual, heavenly, and victorious, but we are glorious.” </p>

Therefore, today the Lord is in the process of recovering the glorious church. Let us read this verse again: “That He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she should be holy and without blemish.” Christ is <span class="pg" data-page-id="498" id="498">[498]</span> sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing us so that we may be a glorious church. He is not doing these things simply to make us spiritual, heavenly, or victorious. </p>

This means that every part of this corporate man is glorious. Are you a part of this glorious man in a practical way? In other words, are you being filled with glory? Even after reading all these messages, we still may be occupied with the thought of victory and may seek to be victorious over our temper or a difficult situation. We may be very appreciative of those whose teaching can lead us into the way of victory. Oh, may the Lord impress us with His desire to have a glorious, shining people! The goal of His economy is to gain a church that shines with His glory. </p>

Until then, we are simply to wait until the Lord Jesus comes to glorify us. But as we pointed out in message fifty-seven, Christ will come from within us. I fully realize that certain verses in the New Testament indicate that Christ will come objectively from the heavens. Nevertheless, other verses indicate that He will come forth from within us and will glorify us in a very subjective way. </p>

In this verse Paul does not speak of the gospel of forgiveness or of justification by faith. He speaks instead of the gospel of the glory of Christ. Our gospel is not simply <span class="pg" data-page-id="499" id="499">[499]</span> a gospel of redemption, forgiveness, and regeneration. It is also the gospel of the glory of Christ. </p>

Contrary to the religious concept, this presentation will not take place suddenly, without any preparation, when the Lord Jesus appears in His coming back. Rather, Christ’s presentation of the glorious church involves a process which began at the time of the Apostles and which has been going on throughout the centuries. Today we also are participating in the process through which Christ is presenting the glorious church to Himself. This presentation is the goal of His sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing. </p>

The more His element is worked into us, the more we are saturated with Himself and the more we are sanctified, cleansed, nourished, and cherished.

It is a matter of our being inwardly saturated with the shekinah glory of God. Suppose a steel rod, hard, cold, and black, is thrust into fire and held there. Eventually, the fire will saturate the steel and cause it to glow. In this way the steel loses its natural color and becomes white hot. In a sense, the color of the steel is swallowed up by the fire. Now the steel is shining, glowing. However, it would be useless, even ridiculous, for someone <span class="pg" data-page-id="502" id="502">[502]</span> to teach steel to shine. What can cause the steel to shine is not teaching, but burning. It must be burned until fire has saturated its very substance. This will cause the steel rod to become a bearer of light. If this steel is to keep on glowing, however, it must remain in the fire. If it is kept out of the fire for any length of time, its natural color and darkness will return. In a similar way, what we need today is not doctrine in letters; we need to be burned by Christ and saturated with Him as the indwelling glory of God. </p>

They actually hindered me and frustrated me from going on with the Lord. Today to me the Bible is not mainly a book of teachings, but a book that reveals the Person of the living Christ. As I read the Word, I open to the Lord, and immediately I experience His burning within me. Since I have His burning, what need do I have for mere teachings? </p>

Only Christ who is the expression of God’s glory can make the church glorious, for only He Himself is the fire of glory that burns His glory into us. Moses had an experience along this line.

Pay attention to the term “unveiled face.” This term indicates a face that used to be veiled and from which the veil has been removed. I am deeply concerned that many of us are still veiled by religious concepts and teachings. Oh, how we need a face unveiled to behold the Lord! Hence, we all should pray, “Lord, remove the veils from me.” </p>

Nevertheless, many believers are covered by layers of veils they do not even realize are there. For this reason, Paul was burdened that the saints would be unveiled. Then with unveiled faces we can behold and reflect the glory of the Lord. In this way we are genuinely transformed from one degree of glory to another. Such a transformation takes place through the Lord Spirit. Therefore, we do not behold doctrines and teachings; we behold the glory of the Lord. Moreover, we are not taught or corrected, but we are transformed into the image of Christ from glory to glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="gBi8-OiEa7te_n7JZc2wVW6gkMFH-ZhCfpqqsc2x3FtvD6W9167GIkeZns_JUH8SK"> In the Lord’s ministry we are fighting to remove the veils from the saints. How subtle is the influence of religion! Its subtlety is seen in the fact that it causes the Lord’s people to become veiled. Although many are sincerely seeking the Lord, they have been completely veiled by religion with its teachings and concepts. Therefore, I say once again that we are here not for doctrine in letters, but for the genuine recovery of the experience of Christ. We all need an unveiled face to behold the Lord. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5tbeNC7n4bELsmeplIXgNzT-jgwifKoF26Q5SKhmn5Z95j36NkbT_ysCBWMthTXfH">VEILED BY ORDINANCES</h2><p data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyFr00i1VOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi"> Let us consider in more detail the matter of ordinances as veils. Sometimes in our meetings we shout praises to the Lord. Visitors may be troubled by our shouting. They may even think that our enthusiasm in the meetings matches that of a crowd at a sporting event. Such a criticism of shouting comes from an ordinance regarding meetings. Others may criticize the meetings because they see no exercise of such gifts as speaking in tongues. This indicates that they have an ordinance concerning gifts. Still others may react to the way certain of the saints dress. This indicates that they have an ordinance concerning the proper way to dress for a church meeting. Let us drop all the ordinances and come back to the living Person of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyTjNtHUYr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> In message after message we desire to do just one thing: to point out your need for the living Christ. You need to be sanctified, cleansed, nourished, and cherished by Him. Nevertheless, no matter how much we emphasize the need to experience Christ as our life and our person, many are still preoccupied with secondary matters related to our meetings or our practice of the church life, because they are still veiled by their ordinances. Therefore, we wish to declare that we are not here for any particular practice. We are here for the wonderful Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8rOBawAUiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> Over the years Christians have been divided by various ordinances and are still being divided by ordinances today. For example, to insist upon the practice of pray-reading is wrong. We are not a church of pray-reading. However, to reject pray-reading is also wrong. In either case, there would be an ordinance regarding pray-reading. We need to turn from all ordinances to the Christ who sanctifies, cleanses, nourishes, and cherishes us. </p>
<p data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxiiysjrdAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy"> It is a mistake to come to Los Angeles with the intention of learning how we practice the church life. Because we are constantly changing, not even we ourselves know the way to have the church life. Prior to 1966 we did not have pray-reading, and before 1968 we did not have the practice of calling on the name of the Lord. Perhaps after another <span class="pg" data-page-id="505" id="505">[505]</span> period of time, the Lord will show us something further that we should practice. To insist that we know the way to have the church life is to cause trouble. </p>

We have seen that firstly we receive God in Christ as grace and realize God in Christ as truth. Then we come to enjoy God as love and light. Love and light are inward elements, whereas grace and truth are outward elements. For this reason, the exhortation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89072" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1-33">5:1-33</span> is deeper than that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89073" data-verses="Ephesians 4:17-32">4:17-32</span>. Love is the inner substance of God that can be sensed, and light is the expressed element of God that can be seen. According to the revelation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89074" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span>, both love and light are to be the inner source of our walk. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gBi8-OiEa7te_n7JZc2wVW6glMFWxZhCfpqqsc2x3FtvD6W9167GIkeZns_JUH8SK">BASIC ELEMENTS AND BASIC FACTORS</h2><p data-content-id="e7TeZuy6ip5trkTcKOr38frN5Dbnqup2tVAiVqlMGn0mLpxnTuxCJvbcyNlyALCaC"> Paul’s writing in Ephesians is both profound and deep. As he was writing this Epistle, he drew upon the deep concepts that were within him. These deeper concepts are the basic elements and basic factors in each chapter. In our reading of Ephesians, we must endeavor to determine what these basic elements and basic factors are, for they are the very components of the book. We have pointed out that the basic elements in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89075" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span> are grace and truth and that the basic elements in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89076" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">chapter five</span> are love and light. Along with these basic elements, there are the basic factors. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89077" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapters four and five</span> Paul’s intention is not simply to give a number of exhortations regarding stealing, putting off falsehood, submission, and love. Nevertheless, many pay attention to such details, but not to the basic elements and basic factors. <span class="pg" data-page-id="510" id="510">[510]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="5tbeNC7n4bELsmeplIXgNzT-igw7SKoF26Q5SKhmn5Z95j36NkbT_ysCBWMthTXfH"> We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89078" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span> the basic factors, on the positive side, are the life of God and the Spirit of God and, on the negative side, the Devil. Now we must go on to see that the most important basic factor in this chapter is the church as the new man. This means that the exhortation here is related to this aspect of the church. The main factor in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89079" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">chapter five</span> is the church as the Bride. Therefore, just as Paul’s exhortation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89080" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span> is related to the new man, so his exhortation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89081" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">chapter five</span> is related to the Bride. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyFr10iQXOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi">THE KEY TO CHAPTER FOUR</h2><p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyTjMtH1br2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> Remember, the subject of the book of Ephesians is not behavior or virtue; it is the church. In giving us the long exhortation recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89082" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span>, Paul never loses sight of his main point—the church. As he presents the principle and the details, he is fully conscious of the church as the new man. Hence, the living described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89083" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span> must be for the church as the new man; that is, the church as the new man must be according to truth and by grace. As the new man, the church should live a life according to God’s standard, according to the truth as it is in Jesus. The only way the church as the new man can have such a life is by God’s all-sufficient grace. This grace supplies us so that we may live according to the mold, the model, the pattern, of the life of Jesus. This is the key to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89084" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="uRn6e8DCDhYvxWArZZyg1AAVSPaevbWQ-S4ajELiYI6nagGr9Sjsomhlk1pMnAffa"> If we apply this key in our reading of this chapter, the entire chapter will be open to us. Keep in mind that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89085" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">Ephesians 4</span> deals with the church as the new man. If we would be the church in this aspect, we must live a life according to the standard of the truth as it is in Jesus and by God’s all-sufficient grace. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4agOuKx5XOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1">LOVE AND LIGHT IN CHAPTER FIVE</h2><p data-content-id="IYKcWTBZD2wraBqVv8VOsOtXcdnZAu5Z92lk4lPzJmdAd2biN-nCndK5RLnSYtepK"> In the same principle, the main point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89086" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">chapter five</span> is the church as the Bride. The main point is not Paul’s exhortation regarding wives submitting to their own husbands or husbands loving their own wives. As the Bride, the church <span class="pg" data-page-id="511" id="511">[511]</span> needs something finer and deeper than truth and grace. There is the need for love and light. Truth is not as fine as light, and grace is not as deep or intimate as love. With respect to the church as the Bride, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89087" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">chapter five</span> Paul speaks of love and light. </p>
<p data-content-id="HfUkPNVdvPc-TGtNi_PIz-voz1zqU3n27HnTj40Roiaxg_VGkAzUncYLNZiT2Ke0a"> The fact that the church as the Bride requires a living in love and in light can be proved by our own experience in married life. If a husband and wife live together merely by grace and according to truth, their married life will be very poor. If my wife were to deal with me according to grace but offer me no love, I would be extremely dissatisfied. She would feel the same if I dealt with her according to grace without love. Married life is based not upon grace, but upon love. In like manner, married life is based not upon truth, but upon light. How pitiful it would be if a husband and wife were always considering the right way to behave toward each other. For the intimate relationship between husband and wife, mere truth is not adequate. There must be light. Therefore, a proper marriage is not merely according to truth and by grace, but is in love and in light. </p>
<p data-content-id="XN29daXoEaiDc-NwR9H8WYCjICQLWqlHCNZd9RwShWBkL98XRz-1aU8fWCfEcI9un"> Is your married life according to truth and by grace, or is it in love and in light? Suppose a wife says to her husband, “Everything I do for you is according to truth and by grace. Nothing I do is wrong or false. Furthermore, everything is by the Lord’s sufficient grace.” This does not sound like the intimacy of a marriage, but sounds like the coldness of a law court. In married life the relationship between wife and husband should be fine, bright, and intimate. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="kW37bRWd4n3ChsU9j6t193oeeSZGWNT7Km646Yo-l1oZoLWUehit8wxR0xamoxSLO">LIVING IN THE REALM OF LIGHT</h2><p data-content-id="Jf0PJ3Yzh-Zban-Z3PEii4PTjX0G16DqyCleWzpwECAyBCCrwndk4EBUpamTJ1Vjs"> Although it is rather easy to understand the difference between love and grace, it is more difficult to understand the distinction between light and truth. Perhaps it will help if I illustrate from my own experience in married life. My wife and I have been married for a good many years. During this time, I cannot recall ever dealing with her according to what I thought was right. On the contrary, by the Lord’s enabling, I have behaved toward her always in light. When we are in <span class="pg" data-page-id="512" id="512">[512]</span> the light, we are outside the realm of right and wrong. There is no need to discern what is right and what is wrong, what we should do and what we should not do. If we are in the light, we simply act and behave spontaneously in a certain way. However, when we are in darkness, we need to discern, to guess, and to grope for a way to do things. But when we are in the light, there is no need for groping, guessing, or discerning. </p>
<p data-content-id="ziHhFbwj9qduVCwT62zA_ZSunUWFPVUD31ttVpb1c14zDjDyuEyTtvwQz3ufe66GN"> Suppose I am about to lose my temper with my wife. There is no need for me at such a time to ask if this is according to truth. I do not need to wonder what my children or the elders of the church will think about it. To ask such questions with respect to husband or wife is to descend from the realm of light to the realm of truth. It is to consider what is according to the standard of the pattern of the life of Jesus. If we remain on the mountaintop in the realm of light, there will be no need for such considerations. As those in the light, we shall not try to discern whether or not it is right to lose our temper at that particular time. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="a-sefdyyFRnPSiT6ZZ18Vpq9mG9JYTLq-KbZep_8kFXpjCLum-lwALY397Cqj_hpR">TWO CASES</h2><p data-content-id="bx_UdsKHw-vHF3mnF2hC5zEttzAlIWM1-A9auvEbkRZG4a2E4SntYRIkifhdfEuRY"> In a foregoing message I referred to the cases of the immoral women in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89088" data-verses="John 4:1">John 4</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89089" data-verses="John 8:1">8</span>. In both cases the word truth is used. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89090" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span> the Lord Jesus speaks of worshipping God in spirit and in truth. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89091" data-verses="John 8:32">John 8:32</span> He says that we shall know the truth and that the truth will set us free. The women in these two chapters were not yet saved. When the Lord was dealing with them, they were candidates for salvation. As such, they were in darkness and in falsehood. However, they were about to be delivered out of darkness and falsehood into the realm of truth and righteousness. I believe that both these women were saved and brought into the realm of truth. However, having entered into this realm, they were to go on to contact the Father and enter into the presence of God where all is light. Here in the realm of light we no longer consider what is right and what is wrong, what is false and what is real. Instead of such considerations, there is simply the shining of light. <span class="pg" data-page-id="513" id="513">[513]</span> </p>

Just as Eve came out of Adam and went back to Adam to be one flesh with him, so the church comes out of Christ and will go back to Christ to be one spirit with Him. God’s desire is that the church which comes out of Christ and returns to Christ will be a glorious church, a church that expresses God and manifests Him. By the sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing the church is being saturated with the essence of God. In this way the church is becoming the Bride to express Christ. Every local church today must be such an expression of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQ4aI9emddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> The glorious church, the church that expresses God, must also be holy and without blemish. As such a holy church, she must be first separated from everything common and then permeated and saturated with the element of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bDHoOVUY0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D"> In order to be without blemish, the church must be without mixture. To be unclean is one thing, and to have some mixture within us is another. We need to be both pure and without mixture. To be without mixture means that in our being we have nothing other than God. For example, we are like precious stone that has no foreign element or substance within it. One day the church will not only be clean and pure, but also without blemish, without mixture. She will be altogether the mingling of the Triune God with a resurrected, uplifted, and transformed humanity. In order that Christ may gain such a church, we are presently undergoing His sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing. <span class="pg" data-page-id="518" id="518">[518]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="jzy56D5a4K14njv2OL9Qfpn053H-C1Ab9R3e21WSu1YH0DQn4sk-OuELvP5dRJ2jv"> The first four chapters of Ephesians cover the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose. For the fulfillment of His purpose, God needs the universal new man, the church as the full-grown man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89111" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span>. In this respect, the new man is the highest aspect of the church. From the church as the assembly we proceed to the church as the household of God, then to the church as the Body, and finally to the church as the full-grown man. </p>
<p data-content-id="TS0vLm3wTVrzuTUulNHSpsNS0UD3-c-25mTg4xYz74KQnIYS77RmuCw_eSmkzr8AS"> Along with the need for God’s purpose to be fulfilled, there is also the need for Christ to be satisfied. Within Christ there is the longing, the deep desire, for satisfaction. Only the church as the Bride can satisfy the longing in Christ’s heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="nFupmXdU7v_F8Wz3VyT4gw61Nec3KqgfhZHMQs6SxdJFG3VrWN2G3kyhCMk9WVErP"> Even in the relationship between husband and wife, the wife should care for her husband’s satisfaction and not merely do certain things for her husband. Before the creation of Eve, the Bible says, “It is not good that the man should be alone” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89112" data-verses="Genesis 2:18">Gen. 2:18</span>). Therefore, the woman was created to fulfill the man’s need for satisfaction. According to the Bible, the satisfaction of a man depends upon the woman. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89113" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span> Paul presents the church as the Bride for Christ’s satisfaction. As we have seen, what is required for the church to be the Bride is not just truth and grace, but light and love. </p>
<p data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyFr20i1dOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi"> The church, who is the new man for the fulfillment of God’s purpose and the Bride for the satisfaction of the longing in Christ’s heart, is also the warrior for the defeat of God’s enemy. Through the spiritual warfare of the church as the warrior, God’s problem with the enemy is solved. If the church is to be the warrior to defeat the enemy, she must have both might and the whole armor of God. Therefore, the church is the new man for the fulfillment of God’s purpose, the Bride for Christ’s satisfaction, and the warrior for the defeat of God’s enemy. </p>

<p data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fBFXNPMTEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z"> In this verse Paul does not simply speak of children, but of <em>the</em> children. By using the definite article before children Paul indicates that the children of believers are not common. They are different from the children of people in the world. Therefore, the particular children, those in the families of believers, are exhorted to obey their parents in the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="inTRR5aqA6f3Zp0g5VCt5vCkmxBsUPP9fz0SGMS6TD8Ev1RYK0XGG-yq2bZI5h3Uz"> The phrase “in the Lord” indicates obedience to the parents by being one with the Lord. It also indicates that this should be done not by self-effort, but by the Lord, and not according to the natural concept, but according to the Lord’s word. The children of believers should realize that they are to obey their parents by being one with the Lord. Moreover, they are to obey their parents not by their own strength, but by the Lord Himself. Their obedience is to be according to the Lord’s word, according to the Scriptures. </p>
<p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQ4aI9Prddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> In this verse Paul says that for the children to obey their parents in the Lord is right. The Greek word may also be rendered just. To obey the parents is both right and just. </p>

The promise, mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89120" data-verses="Ephesians 6:3">verse 3</span>, is that it may be well with the children and that they may live long on the earth. The first part of the promise is related to prosperity in material blessing; it also refers to <span class="pg" data-page-id="520" id="520">[520]</span> living in a peaceful situation. The second part is to have longevity. According to this commandment, prosperity and longevity are God’s blessings in this life to those who honor their parents. </p>
<p data-content-id="jzy56D5a4K14njv2OL9Qfpn053HnB1Ab9R3e21WSu1YH0DQn4sk-OuELvP5dRJ2jv"> Honoring is different from obeying. Obedience refers to an action, whereas honor denotes an attitude. It is possible for the children to obey their parents without honoring them. In order to honor their parents, the children need a certain attitude, a certain spirit. All the children need to learn to obey their parents with honor. </p>
<p data-content-id="TS0vLm3wTVrzuTUulNHSpsNS0UDe0c-25mTg4xYz74KQnIYS77RmuCw_eSmkzr8AS"> If we would live long on the earth, we need to honor our parents. Those who fail to honor their parents commit suicide in a gradual way. They actually shorten their life on earth. If you wish to prolong your days, learn to obey your parents with honor. In the Bible this is the unique condition for having a long life. Anyone who desires a long life needs to fulfill this condition. </p>

Fathers</h2><p data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR00aBZ6EWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89121" data-verses="Ephesians 6:4">verse 4</span> Paul turns to the fathers: “And the fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.” Provoking to anger damages the children by stirring up their flesh. It is always destructive for parents to be angry with their children. For this reason, I counsel the parents not to lose their temper when dealing with their children. Not provoking the children’s anger requires the fathers’ anger to be dealt with by remaining under the cross. The only way we can keep from losing our temper is to stay on the cross. In dealing with your children’s wrongdoings or misbehavior, you must firstly go to the cross and stay there. Otherwise, you will lose your temper, and this loss of temper will provoke your children’s anger. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4GxWoTDDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> Instead of provoking the children to anger, the fathers are to nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord. To nurture children means to bring them up, to raise them, by nourishing them. Raising children requires that the parents give them the needed instruction related to <span class="pg" data-page-id="521" id="521">[521]</span> human life, family life, and social life. The word admonition here includes instruction. Paul was probably referring to the Old Testament requirement that parents instruct their children with the word of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89122" data-verses="Deuteronomy 6:7">Deut. 6:7</span>). This means that we are to teach our children with the Bible. Along with this instruction, we sometimes must discipline them, chastise them. It is crucial that parents learn to nurture the children in the discipline and admonition of the Lord. </p>

As we have seen, in Ephesians Paul covers various aspects of the church. The Greek word for church, <em>ekklesia,</em> denotes a gathering, an assembly, of called ones. For example, when city officials in ancient times called the people of the city together for a meeting, that meeting was known as an <em>ekklesia.</em> The church is such an assembly of God’s called people. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89132" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span> Paul reveals that the church is the Body of Christ. Just as a person’s body is his stature and expression, so the church as the Body of Christ is the stature and expression of Christ. As Christ’s Body, the church is the fullness of the One who fills all in all. </p>
<p data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6opwPd0vLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89133" data-verses="Ephesians 2:10">2:10</span> Paul indicates that the church is God’s poem, His masterpiece, a poetic writing that expresses the desire of the writer’s heart. In this chapter Paul goes on to point out that the church is the corporate new man created in Christ Jesus, the commonwealth of God, and the household of God. Furthermore, in this chapter the church is also the dwelling place of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89134" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">v. 22</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="ZF7iQ7T0lQJP8gtIC7nMKHRqmLdlMgK5Boj8tqPtmmD8KvxV6FuuLU1d_HGholgwP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89135" data-verses="Ephesians 3:4">3:4</span> Paul speaks of the mystery of Christ. The mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church. As the mystery of God, Christ is the definition of God. In the same principle, as the mystery of Christ, the church is the definition of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OQgZSC52SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89136" data-verses="Ephesians 3:19">3:19</span> Paul uses the term the fullness of God. This term is similar to the expression “the fullness of the One Who fills all in all” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89137" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">1:23</span>). The fullness of God refers mainly to the source, and the fullness of the One who fills all in all refers mainly to the outcome. For example, the fullness of God is <span class="pg" data-page-id="526" id="526">[526]</span> like a fountain, and the fullness of the One who fills all in all is like the stream that flows forth from the fountain. The church is both the fullness of God and the fullness of Christ as the One who fills all in all. </p>
<p data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2etIbK1SmgmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89138" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span> Paul again speaks of the new man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89139" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">v. 24</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89140" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Chapter two</span> covers the creation of the new man, but not the living of the new man. The new man is composed of two peoples, the believing Jews and the believing Gentiles. Concerning the living of the new man, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89141" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span> covers both the principle and the details. The principle is related to the truth as it is in Jesus, the mold established by the living of Jesus on earth. The details are related to God’s grace. By grace the new man carries out God’s eternal purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiE3ur6Ct8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89142" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">chapters five and six</span> we see two further aspects of the church: the Bride to satisfy the desire of Christ and the warrior to defeat God’s enemy. As the Bride, the church needs love and light. As the warrior, the church needs might and the whole armor of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="a-sefdyyFRnPSiT6ZZ18Vpq9kG9JQTLq-KbZep_8kFXpjCLum-lwALY397Cqj_hpR">I. THE NEGATIVE SIDE<br/>OF THE CHURCH’S RESPONSIBILITY</h2><p data-content-id="bx_UdsKHw-vHF3mnF2hC5zEtvzAlAWM1-A9auvEbkRZG4a2E4SntYRIkifhdfEuRY"> Of the twelve aspects of the church covered in Ephesians, the main aspects are the new man, the Bride, and the warrior. The new man includes the aspect of the Body, and the Body includes the fullness and the dwelling place. Therefore, the first ten aspects of the church are all included in the new man who fulfills God’s eternal purpose and carries out His economy. This new man is used by the Triune God to accomplish what He planned in eternity past for eternity future. Nevertheless, although God’s plan is fulfilled with the new man, Christ’s desire still needs to be satisfied, and God’s enemy still must be defeated. Hence, there is the need for the church to be both the Bride and the warrior. </p>
<p data-content-id="qrCoreirL3MU0e6xc6vji8PFqGrIvz5zIOcWFV4v-HiHK0TVU2I9mwTIzwi4vYBpQ"> The passage from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89143" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">1:1</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89144" data-verses="Ephesians 6:9">6:9</span> completes the revelation on the positive side concerning the church for the fulfilling of God’s eternal purpose. Yet on the negative side, that is, for <span class="pg" data-page-id="527" id="527">[527]</span> dealing with God’s enemy, something still remains to be covered. In the first five chapters the church is portrayed in many ways, on the positive side, to fulfill God’s eternal purpose. On the negative side, the church is seen in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89145" data-verses="Ephesians 6:1">chapter six</span> as a warrior to defeat God’s enemy, the Devil. To do this, the church must put on the whole armor of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="yso9Pxvovo30rgMfTrxdwDtQUBNZgZ3STh7ddBjVVV-UFyNUyESGMFZxFx7YtQwo0"> In 1928 brother Nee held his first overcomer conference on spiritual warfare. In that conference Satan, the evil one, was exposed to the uttermost. Brother Nee pointed out that in the universe there are three wills: the divine will, the satanic will, and the human will. If we would know how the church can be God’s warrior to engage in spiritual warfare, we must know these three wills, these three intentions. God’s will, being self-existing, is eternal, uncreated. As created beings, the angels also have a will. One of these angels, an archangel, was appointed by God to rule the universe that existed before the creation of Adam. Because of his high position and his beauty, this archangel became proud. This pride gave rise to an evil intention, which became the satanic will. Therefore, in addition to God’s intention, God’s will, there is a second intention, a second will, for now the satanic will is set against God’s will. </p>
<p data-content-id="8h6Q8qq7fu5OpgOocEN7CqtXqk5Cb-y1o55tduWJ4FjR4dq0idwixNOYWvRUriXAE"> All warfare has its source in this conflict of wills. Before the satanic will rose up to contradict the divine will, there was no war in the universe. The controversy in the universe began with the rebellion of the archangel against God. That rebellion was the beginning of all the fighting that is now taking place among nations, in society, in the family, and in individuals. Throughout history there have been wars between nations, groups, persons, and even within individuals. For example, you may experience an inner warfare between your reason and your lust. All the different kinds of warfare have their source in the controversy between the divine will and the satanic will. </p>
<p data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUmCzoJQzXNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0"> We do not know how much time elapsed between the rebellion of Satan and the creation of Adam. We simply know that at a particular time, God created man and endowed him with a human will that was free. It is because <span class="pg" data-page-id="528" id="528">[528]</span> of God’s greatness that He gave man a free will. A great person will never compel anyone to follow him. By giving man a free will, God was indicating that He would not force man to obey Him. When I was young, I thought that God was not wise in creating man with a free will. If I had been God, I would have made it impossible for man to have had a choice. I would have created man in such a way that all he could do was follow God. But in His greatness God gave man freedom of choice. </p>
<p data-content-id="7_JcBoLt_f4p4TwS9GhdcDPyb4eON0dHgTG9jncdwDuWZJuJ-gcIVOYb7Z2qhulnR"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89146" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we see that man was free to exercise his will to eat either of the tree of life or of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. These two trees represent the divine will and the satanic will, respectively. Hence, in the garden there was a triangular situation, with the tree of life representing the divine will, the tree of knowledge representing the satanic will, and Adam representing the human will. Actually, the tree of life denotes God Himself, and the tree of knowledge denotes Satan. Therefore, there were three persons—God, Satan, and man—each one with a will. </p>
<p data-content-id="_gz5R_nH5oLy8-la4zwars7xUBAIdijurKKMBUDGJR9KRsTuy0qXMYueEupKE4DZW"> Although there were three wills, the controversy involved just two parties—God and Satan. The crucial issue was whether man would choose the divine will or the satanic will. If the human will stood with the divine will, then God’s will would be accomplished. But if the human will took sides with the satanic will, Satan’s will would be carried out, at least temporarily. As we all know, the human will took sides with the satanic will. This means that man chose to follow Satan and sided with the satanic will. Therefore, Satan was victorious temporarily. </p>
<p data-content-id="B77vULL4YXIHFFm6havIcY95XVNW4oUVhHMvf-EO7Y7mN_8U3mz_Sb5pyhxZje63p"> However, through repentance man can turn from the satanic will to the divine will, from Satan’s side to God’s side. The first commandment in the gospel is to repent. The next two commandments are to believe and to be baptized. Any sinner who desires to be saved must obey these three commandments. He must repent to God, believe in the Lord Jesus, and be baptized in water. To repent is to have a turn from the satanic will to the divine will. Since birth our will <span class="pg" data-page-id="529" id="529">[529]</span> has stood on the side of the satanic will. The reason for this is that we were in Adam when he chose Satan’s will above God’s will. </p>

The first three items—the girdle, the breastplate, and the shoes—form a group. By means of these three things we are able to stand. Along with these three items, we need to take up the shield of faith and receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89184" data-verses="Ephesians 6:16-17">6:16-17</span>). </p>

This is actually Christ Himself lived out by us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89191" data-verses="John 14:6">John 14:6</span>). Such truth, such reality, is the girdle that strengthens our whole being for spiritual warfare. Our living must have a principle and a standard. This is nothing <span class="pg" data-page-id="538" id="538">[538]</span> less than God Himself expressed in our living in a practical way. When such a truth girds our loins, we are made strong for the purpose of standing. </p>
<p data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bDHuOVJS0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D"> Suppose, however, that your daily living is far below the standard of the truth as it is in Jesus. Instead of being able to stand and to withstand in the evil day, you will flee. Because in your daily walk there is no testimony and no expression of God, you do not have the strength to stand against the stratagems of the Devil. If our daily living is loose, we are not able to stand against the powers of darkness. In order for us to stand, our daily living must be according to the principle of the truth and up to the standard of the truth. As we have pointed out, this truth is God Himself expressed as the principle of our daily walk, as the standard of our daily living, and as the pattern of our life. </p>
<p data-content-id="jzy56D5a4K14njv2OL9Qfpn0_3HnJ1Ab9R3e21WSu1YH0DQn4sk-OuELvP5dRJ2jv"> Those who have such a living certainly have their loins girded with truth.

Satan is our accuser. In fighting against him we need a conscience <span class="pg" data-page-id="539" id="539">[539]</span> void of offense. But no matter how good we may feel our conscience is, we need to have it covered with the breastplate of righteousness. Righteousness is to be right with both God and man. If we have just a little problem with either God or man, Satan will accuse us, and there will be holes in our conscience through which all of our faith and boldness will leak out. Hence, we need the covering of righteousness to protect us from the enemy’s accusation. Such righteousness is Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89194" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Cor. 1:30</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4G3WofFDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> If in any thing we are not righteous, our conscience will be a conscience with offense. But if we are to engage in spiritual warfare, we must have a conscience void of offense, a conscience without holes. When our conscience has holes in it, our faith will leak out through the holes. If accusations and offenses remain on our conscience, faith will disappear. Therefore, we need to deal with our conscience in order to have a good conscience, a conscience void of offense. In addition, we need to put on the breastplate of righteousness to cover our conscience. </p>
<p data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAz2pTlZhH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9"> Whenever we are about to fight the spiritual warfare, Satan, the accuser, attacks our conscience. He does not trouble us so much in this way at other times, Satan knows when there are offenses on our conscience. When he accuses us with respect to these offenses, we are immediately weakened. </p>

Righteousness is in the blood, and the covering of the blood is the breastplate. Although this may be difficult to explain doctrinally, we can understand it experientially. Whenever we intend to fight against the powers of darkness, Satan, through his accusations, causes our conscience to become very sensitive. These feelings actually are not the sensitivity of the conscience, but the result of Satan’s accusations. Immediately our response should be, “I overcome Satan, the accuser, not by my perfection and not even by a conscience void of offense, but by the blood of the Lamb. I am <span class="pg" data-page-id="540" id="540">[540]</span> defended against his accusations by the breastplate of righteousness.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5e24ryI1O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6"> The righteousness that covers our conscience and that guards us from Satan’s accusations is Christ Himself. He is our righteousness. Thus, Christ is the truth that girds our loins and also the breastplate of righteousness that covers our conscience. We are covered not by our own righteousness, but by Christ as our righteousness. Some may wonder how the breastplate of righteousness can be related both to Christ and to the blood. In experience we cannot separate the blood from Christ. Apart from His blood, Christ could not cover us. Under the cleansing of His blood, He becomes our righteousness. Whenever we are about to take part in the spiritual warfare, we need to pray, “Lord, cover me with Yourself as my righteousness. Lord, I hide under Your blood.” Furthermore, we must tell the accuser, “Satan, I overcome you, not by my merit, but by the prevailing blood of the Lamb.” </p>

But this is an incorrect understanding derived from an inaccurate translation. </p>
<p data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiE3pr6vk8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND"> In order to understand Paul’s thought in this verse, we need to see that here the gospel is not the gospel of grace, nor the gospel of the forgiveness of sins, nor even the gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ. Here the gospel is the gospel of peace. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89200" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15-16">2:15 and 16</span>, on the cross Christ accomplished peace so that the Gentiles can contact the Jewish believers and so that we all can contact God. This peace is glad tidings, good news. In other words, it is the gospel. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89201" data-verses="Ephesians 2:17">2:17</span> says that Christ preached the gospel of peace. </p>

<p data-content-id="bx_UdsKHw-vHF3mnF2hC5zEtpzA0LWM1-A9auvEbkRZG4a2E4SntYRIkifhdfEuRY"> In the foregoing message we considered the first three items of the armor of God: the girdle, the breastplate, and the shoes. The girdle is related to truth, the breastplate is related to righteousness, and the shoes are related to peace. We have seen that truth is God expressed in our living as our standard, pattern, and principle. Righteousness is Christ in our enjoyment and experience as the covering of our conscience. If we have truth in our living, we shall certainly have righteousness as our covering. The Bible reveals that righteousness issues in peace. This is peace both with God and with man. It is the very peace Christ accomplished on the cross for us. Therefore, to have the girdle, the breastplate, and the shoes is to have truth, righteousness, and peace. When we live out God in our daily living, we are covered with Christ as our righteousness, and we have peace as our firm foundation. Then we are prepared to fight against the enemy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qrCoreirL3MU0e6xc6vji8PFsGrVnz5zIOcWFV4v-HiHK0TVU2I9mwTIzwi4vYBpQ">I. THE SHIELD OF FAITH</h2><p data-content-id="yso9Pxvovo30rgMfTrxdwDtQSBNApZ3STh7ddBjVVV-UFyNUyESGMFZxFx7YtQwo0"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89203" data-verses="Ephesians 6:16">Verse 16</span> says, “With all these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one.” We need truth to gird our loins, righteousness to cover our conscience, peace as the standing for our feet, and faith to shield our entire being. If we live by God as truth, we have righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89204" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">4:24</span>), and righteousness issues in peace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89205" data-verses="Hebrews 12:11">Heb. 12:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89206" data-verses="Isaiah 32:17">Isa. 32:17</span>). With all these, we can easily have faith as a shield against the flaming darts of the evil one. Christ is the Author and Perfecter of <span class="pg" data-page-id="544" id="544">[544]</span> such faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89207" data-verses="Hebrews 12:2">Heb. 12:2</span>). For us to stand firmly in the battle we need to be equipped with these four items of God’s armor. </p>
<p data-content-id="8h6Q8qq7fu5OpgOocEN7CqtXsk5nV-y1o55tduWJ4FjR4dq0idwixNOYWvRUriXAE"> The shield of faith is not something that we put on, but something that we take up in order to protect ourselves against the attacks of the enemy. Faith comes after truth, righteousness, and peace. If we have truth in our living, righteousness as our covering, and peace as our standing, we shall spontaneously have faith. This faith is a safeguard against the fiery darts, the attacks, of the enemy. </p>
<p data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUmC1oJx8XNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0"> We need now to consider the shield of faith in detail. We certainly are not to have faith in our own ability, strength, merit, or virtue. Our faith must be in God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89208" data-verses="Mark 11:22">Mark 11:22</span>). God is real, living, present, and available. We need to have faith in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="B77vULL4YXIHFFm6havIcY95RVNWwoUVhHMvf-EO7Y7mN_8U3mz_Sb5pyhxZje63p"> We also should have faith in God’s heart. Every Christian must know both God and the heart of God. God’s heart toward us is always good. No matter what may happen to us or what kind of sufferings we may undergo, we must always believe in the goodness of God’s heart. God has no intention to punish us, to injure us, or to cause us to suffer loss. </p>
<p data-content-id="xOItbD1M_SnXcAkcMHRO0aDdpC_nCBIPiZ8yi6s5e1DrTLjV78UWPV1TgR921-jvh"> Along with faith in God’s heart, we should have faith in God’s faithfulness. We may change, but God does not change. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89209" data-verses="James 1:17">James 1:17</span> says, there is no shadow of turning with Him. Furthermore, He cannot lie (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89210" data-verses="Titus 1:2">Titus 1:2</span>), but is always faithful to His word. </p>
<p data-content-id="rzBtTvnnp8EWQ9SXyt4WJFpaJK0wYN18pC-iFM-wWF7biwez5fLvQHeKFo4_b1dI7"> God is not only faithful, but also able. Therefore, we need to have faith in God’s ability. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89211" data-verses="Ephesians 3:20">3:20</span> Paul declares that God “is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think.” </p>
<p data-content-id="dvx25G8sssSYMALmWN9v-wwfG3yApwN7G3_YIZuDLoUsHACVRNy6oYa6xgCQFEpxU"> Still another aspect of our faith is faith in God’s word. God is bound to fulfill all that He has spoken. The more He speaks, the more responsible He becomes to fulfill His own word. We can tell Him, “God, You have spoken, and Your written Word is in our hand. Lord, You are bound to fulfill Your word.” Hallelujah for God’s faithful word! </p>
<p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9TtVFU7TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> We also need to have faith in God’s will. Because God is a God of purpose, He has a will. His will with respect to us is always positive. Hence, no matter what befalls us, we should <span class="pg" data-page-id="545" id="545">[545]</span> care not for our happiness or our environment, but for God’s will. Our environment may change, but God’s will never changes. </p>
<p data-content-id="KinSpiWncXMNo5T64K5GnF27mvJMOAmz0SWiBllAApDxAJJy3NRnyUU_zHhMXOBI9"> Furthermore, we must have faith in God’s sovereignty. Because God is sovereign, God could never make a mistake. Under His sovereignty, even our mistakes work for good. If God did not sovereignly allow us to make mistakes, we could not possibly make them. (However, this does not mean that we should deliberately make mistakes.) When we are wrong, we need to repent. But there is no need for us to regret, for that means we are lacking in faith. After we repent for a mistake or shortcoming, we must still exercise faith in God’s sovereignty. We could not have made that mistake if He had not sovereignly allowed us to do so. Hence, there is no need for regret. </p>
<p data-content-id="lwsB7fTo0YBNqEyc92s8YZtBfuR5l2669bSShh3cXlYnPCMXGJH6EofNa-wN0fGTI"> We all need to have a full faith in God, in God’s heart, in God’s faithfulness, in God’s ability, in God’s word, in God’s will, and in God’s sovereignty. If we have such a faith, Satan’s flaming darts will not be able to damage us. </p>
<p data-content-id="ORuveXsLSL_KAUQRmmsRwUA3jxfJksZhadewDeZFVr0RNBcjRKpEUgJ7ZofkxfD26"> The flaming darts are Satan’s temptations, proposals, doubts, questions, lies, and attacks. Flaming darts were used by warriors in the apostle’s time, and the apostle used this as an illustration of Satan’s attacks on us. Every temptation is a deceit, a false promise. The flaming darts include the Devil’s proposals that come to us. As we are waking up in the morning, often Satan will make proposals to us. For this reason, we need to get into the Word the first thing in the morning. If we are not in the Word, we shall have no covering against the Devil’s proposals. Doubts and questions are also flaming darts of Satan. Have you ever noticed that a question mark looks very much like a serpent? It was Satan who asked Eve, “Hath God said?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89212" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Gen. 3:1</span>). When the Devil questions us in this way, our response should be to flee, without even talking to him. Many times Satan attacks us with lies. But the shield of faith also guards us against these flaming darts. </p>
<p data-content-id="4hu3V9NSxOD4qIDQx-aI8nyHKXQAdHAukquOkznsExY9T1eCWD6YHuZmIvOhld_9j"> The Devil’s flaming darts come as thoughts injected into our mind. These thoughts may seem to be our own thoughts, <span class="pg" data-page-id="546" id="546">[546]</span> but they are actually Satan’s. I used to believe that such thoughts were my own. Later I began to realize that they came from Satan. I discovered this after such thoughts persisted in coming after I had decided not to entertain them. I saw that these thoughts were not mine, but Satan’s. Prior to that time, my practice was to confess all these thoughts to the Lord. Now I refuse to confess them. However, some may think that even though these thoughts come from Satan, they are injected into us because we are evil. Do not believe this. Rather, you should say, “Lord, I am fallen, but I am under Your cleansing. Satan, this thought is yours, and you must bear the responsibility for it. I will not share this responsibility.” Nevertheless, due to an overly sensitive conscience some continually confess things that are caused by Satan. Never confess thoughts injected into you by Satan in his subtlety. </p>
<p data-content-id="od6p5sc1GDqOFwWB01GI4UNpFvyh4TvvTOTFDcnJar4LT8Qnqe8UcaKDTX05Qn6K7"> In order to have the faith to be defended against Satan’s flaming darts, we need a proper spirit with a conscience void of offense. However, faith is not mainly in our spirit nor in our conscience, but in our will, the strongest part of our heart. The New Testament says that we believe with our heart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89213" data-verses="Romans 10:10">Rom. 10:10</span>). According to our experience, this faith in our heart is related mainly to the exercise of our will. No one with a will like a jellyfish can have strong faith. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89214" data-verses="James 1:6">James 1:6</span> we are told that he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind. Such a person has a vacillating will. Hence, if we would have faith, we need to exercise our will. </p>

THE HELMET OF SALVATION</h2><p data-content-id="GJHsP88GHseo8rpjYyem_lGTXqQ544KrNMLYo1DtwblC8XXjSuatQl8WDTK_MeK3O"> In the first part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89215" data-verses="Ephesians 6:17">verse 17</span> Paul goes on to say, “And receive the helmet of salvation.” This is for covering our mind, our mentality, against the negative thoughts directed at us by the evil one. Such a helmet, such a covering, is God’s salvation. Satan injects into our mind threats, worries, anxieties, and other weakening thoughts. God’s salvation is the covering we take up against all these. Such a salvation is the saving Christ we experience in our daily life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89216" data-verses="John 16:33">John 16:33</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="547" id="547">[547]</span> </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dvx25G8sssSYMALmWN9v-wwfF3yRgwN7G3_YIZuDLoUsHACVRNy6oYa6xgCQFEpxU">I. PRAYER AS THE APPLICATION OF THE ITEMS<br/>OF GOD’S ARMOR</h2><p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9TuVFJ1TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> We have seen that the armor of God is composed of six items: the girdle of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the firm foundation of the gospel of peace, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit. When we are equipped with such a full armor, we can stand against the attack of the enemy and even take the offensive against him. After these items of the armor of God, Paul turns to prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="KinSpiWncXMNo5T64K5GnF27lvJVBAmz0SWiBllAApDxAJJy3NRnyUU_zHhMXOBI9"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89226" data-verses="Ephesians 6:18">Verse 18</span> says, “By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit, and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.” The phrase “by means of all prayer and petition” modifies the word receive in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89227" data-verses="Ephesians 6:17">verse 17</span>. By prayer we receive both the helmet of salvation and the word of God. This indicates that we need to receive the word of God by means of all prayer and petition. We need to pray as we are receiving the word of God. We have seen that the whole armor of God is composed of six items. Prayer may be considered the seventh. It is the means by which we apply the other items. </p>
<p data-content-id="lwsB7fTo0YBNqEyc92s8YZtBcuRcp2669bSShh3cXlYnPCMXGJH6EofNa-wN0fGTI"> The modifier “by means of all prayer and petition” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89228" data-verses="Ephesians 6:18">verse 18</span> is related to all six items of the armor covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89229" data-verses="Ephesians 6:14-17">verses 14 through 17</span>. It is by means of all prayer and petition that we gird our loins with truth, put on the breastplate of righteousness, and have our feet shod with <span class="pg" data-page-id="552" id="552">[552]</span> the firm foundation of the gospel of peace. Furthermore, it is by prayer that we take up the shield of faith and receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Whenever we are about to put on the armor or to take up any item of the armor, we need to pray. We cannot and we should not attempt to use any part of God’s armor without prayer. Prayer is the unique way to apply the armor of God. It is prayer that makes the armor available to us in a practical way. For example, we may have the helmet of salvation, but it is prayer that makes this helmet available and prevailing. Therefore, prayer is crucial and vital. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ORuveXsLSL_KAUQRmmsRwUA3gxfopsZhadewDeZFVr0RNBcjRKpEUgJ7ZofkxfD26">II. PRAYING</h2><p data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5e26ryI9O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89230" data-verses="Ephesians 6:18">verse 18</span> Paul speaks not just of one kind of prayer, but of all prayer and petition. Prayer is general, whereas petition is particular. We should pray both in an ordinary way and, when necessary, in an extraordinary way, perhaps giving up sleep or food in order to petition the Lord concerning a certain situation. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6op1PdlkLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9">A. At Every Time</h2><p data-content-id="ZF7iQ7T0lQJP8gtIC7nMKHRqjLd4EgK5Boj8tqPtmmD8KvxV6FuuLU1d_HGholgwP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89231" data-verses="Ephesians 6:18">verse 18</span> Paul speaks of “praying at every time.” Some think the phrase “at every time” means simply every time we pray. To others it means all the time. To pray all the time corresponds to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89232" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:17">1 Thessalonians 5:17</span> to pray without ceasing. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OQlZSbw2SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH">B. In Spirit</h2><p data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2etIeK13ogmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89233" data-verses="Ephesians 6:18">verse 18</span> Paul says specifically that we are to pray in spirit. This refers to our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. It may be considered the mingled spirit—our spirit mingled with God’s Spirit. Whenever we are in our spirit, we are also in the Holy Spirit, for our spirit is one with the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89234" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). Therefore, Paul’s charge to pray in spirit implies that we must also pray in the Spirit of God, for these two spirits are mingled in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiE3rr6ji8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND"> In prayer, the main faculty we should use is our spirit. If our mind is overactive or if our emotion is not under control, <span class="pg" data-page-id="553" id="553">[553]</span> we shall find it difficult to pray. When we pray, our mind should be at rest, and our emotion should be regulated, neither too hot nor too cold. According to my experience, I easily become distracted in prayer when my mind is preoccupied with other things. Likewise, when my emotion is not properly regulated, I find it difficult to utter something from my spirit in prayer. Hence, in order to pray in spirit, we need to be adjusted in our mind and balanced in our emotion. This requires a great deal of inward exercise. </p>
<p data-content-id="P5LAppNM9anuOY8qKFZGxcajyXKRBW6wXX1IPiDZBj9REBKOwCbu8774faHM2uakW"> Furthermore, if we would pray at every time in spirit, our will must be strong. A person with a will like a jellyfish cannot pray. It may seem that prayer is easy, but actually it is difficult. It is very easy to talk or read, but it is not easy to pray. This is the reason that prayer requires the exercise of our will. </p>
<p data-content-id="-xjGehvejCQlzalTuo32KU2DUU9jSuPgtsH4FEYaUB1lCP61PJ3xPUdWBlbNL_kSt"> A Christian must be a praying person. It is a sin not to pray. If you fail to pray for others, the saints or those in your family, you are sinning. However, not many Christians regard the lack of prayer as sin. We need to exercise our will to be people of prayer. For the sake of a proper prayer life, our mind must be sober, our emotion must be regulated, and our will must be strengthened. Then we shall be able to pray at every time in spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="pUgU6yw7JGTUYrgFoe8JTp3CdQJHav7TrTsP0dxOoJBaWmsdb5vA9y_VoOGAtYpSI">III. WATCHING</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="vNGdZHHY14iAb_v6HwIE3H6CIAnRVeE22cQi8F0_YUxRFUJ9ktsfg-XG_7irJOOpq">A. For This Prayer</h2>
<p data-content-id="WMnpS5Obzk_YTS3q3GOFH1SRqAwlOrnZYpJ1P_jLUOjwyCSv5ZbC6HMtrIdmASj5I"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89235" data-verses="Ephesians 6:18">verse 18</span> Paul goes on to speak of “watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.” This indicates that we need to be watchful, on the alert, for this prayer life. We need to be on guard lest we be robbed of time that should be devoted to prayer. To be watchful in a practical way, many in the churches set aside specific times to pray. </p>
<p data-content-id="2dq7QF0hlVfHljch6uMOWbrY38vYrD7PM_en5LHupWopm5T9JM8tlnCWOoNUSQNy6"> To watch unto prayer implies that we exercise our will, calm our mind, and regulate our emotion in order to pray properly. It takes a considerable amount of exercise to make our mind, emotion, and will submissive and obedient. Because many do not practice this, their mind is rebellious. <span class="pg" data-page-id="554" id="554">[554]</span> When they tell the mind to calm down, it becomes all the more active. Others have trouble with the emotion. We need to be those who exercise ourselves to such a degree that as soon as we have finished a long conversation we are able to pray. The need for such an exercise is implied in Paul’s word about watching unto prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="uRn6e8DCDhYvxWArZZyg1AAVVPaStbWQ-S4ajELiYI6nagGr9Sjsomhlk1pMnAffa"> If we do not watch unto our prayer life, we shall lose time. Here and there throughout the day, our time will be wasted. We may lose time because our time is neither scheduled nor controlled. When we are at work, our time may be closely regulated. But when it comes to prayer, many do not schedule their time. As a result, much time which could be devoted to prayer is lost. If we do not redeem our time and grasp every available opportunity, much time will be needlessly lost. Although you may be very busy, do not use this as an excuse for not praying. If you place a high value on your prayer life, you will watch unto it and arrange time for it. No matter how busy you may be, you will still have time to pray. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4agOpKx1VOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1"> According to the examples in the Bible, it is better to have more than one time set aside for prayer daily. For example, Daniel prayed three times a day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89236" data-verses="Daniel 6:10">Dan. 6:10</span>). Also the psalmist spoke of praying in the morning, at noon, and in the evening (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89237" data-verses="Psalms 55:17">Psa. 55:17</span>). If we build up the habit of praying at regular times every day, great blessing will be brought in. This blessing will affect not only our personal lives, but also the church, our neighborhood, and even our nation. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="IYKcWTBZD2wraBqVv8VOsOtXbdnVGu5Z92lk4lPzJmdAd2biN-nCndK5RLnSYtepK">B. In All Perseverance</h2><p data-content-id="HfUkPNVdvPc-TGtNi_PIz-vo01zmS3n27HnTj40Roiaxg_VGkAzUncYLNZiT2Ke0a"> Paul charges us to watch unto prayer in all perseverance. To keep a prayer life we need all perseverance, a constant, persistent care. If you have set aside a certain time in the morning for prayer, then you need to persistently watch regarding this time. Do not allow any distractions. You may want to take the telephone off the hook for that period of time. If we are not persistent in watching unto prayer, the enemy will send in many distractions. <span class="pg" data-page-id="555" id="555">[555]</span> </p>

RECOMMENDING TYCHICUS</h2><p data-content-id="EkaMV3Soowz1Y1LdwSAggraY_cxtk6M0H0MN5WrZ4ZYcDUwX2c921mm7c4iIL8IZY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89242" data-verses="Ephesians 6:19-20">verses 19 and 20</span> Paul asks the saints to pray on his behalf. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89243" data-verses="Ephesians 6:21">verse 21</span> he goes on to say, “But that you also may know what concerns me, what I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will make all things known to you.” This indicates that, on the one hand, Paul needed the saints to pray for him, but, on the other hand, he had a real concern for the saints and sent Tychicus to them both to bring them information regarding him and also to comfort their hearts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89244" data-verses="Ephesians 6:22">v. 22</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="D20V42Q_F8EMHQVYOrygvO7d12Bvl4EAp5I6xaxu5BS3a8z8gUxLYQQk1sl7LSiAO"> This indicates that there was an excellent relationship with good fellowship between Paul and the saints in Ephesus. It also points out the need for a go-between such as Tychicus. The apostle, the believers, and Tychicus were one. Firstly, Paul set an example by asking the believers to pray for him. Then he sent Tychicus to them to bring them information concerning him and to comfort them. How sweet and beautiful this is! Although we rarely practice this today, we should endeavor to have such a practice. We need this kind of fellowship. </p>
<p data-content-id="S26jTFFVZnj955_hMlMnIhY03MxRvdPkCD61VuHGKt4L3wCMJyIZ3UBt_LzbPLTVG"> Tychicus was not sent to carry on a great work. On the contrary, his task was to inform the saints about Paul’s situation and to comfort their hearts. Although in the time of Paul, there were no modern means of transportation, such as steamers or airplanes, he had Tychicus make the long journey from Rome to Asia Minor just to visit the saints on his behalf. The goal of this long journey was fellowship <span class="pg" data-page-id="558" id="558">[558]</span> between the apostle and the saints. This is so important that it is recorded in the Word of God. The apostle was concerned for the church, and the church was concerned for the apostle. Therefore, Tychicus was sent from Rome to Asia Minor for the purpose of fellowship. In the Lord’s recovery today, such a loving concern between the apostles and the churches needs to be restored. We need this concern, not to carry out a commission or do a work, but to have the necessary and proper fellowship. Today there also is the need for messengers to visit the churches to relay information and to encourage the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="gBi8-OiEa7te_n7JZc2wVW6gjMFmxZhCfpqqsc2x3FtvD6W9167GIkeZns_JUH8SK"> In the Body of Christ we need much more traffic. The sending of Tychicus by the Apostle Paul to a local church created a kind of traffic. Traffic strengthens a country. Consider the impact of all the highways the federal government has built. These are the veins of the prosperity of the United States. Traffic, even across great stretches of open land, results in mutual supply and improvement. When I was growing up, just to travel the distance from our little village to Chefoo was a whole day’s journey on foot. We had to make preparations the day before, then leave very early in the morning to get there by evening. It was such an effort to go just that distance that many people spent their whole lives in that village without ever going to Chefoo. It is traffic that has made the United States prosperous. In addition to the highways, the airlines with so many cross-country flights have increased the prosperity of this nation. </p>
<p data-content-id="4hu3V9NSxOD4qIDQx-aI8nyHIXQAVHAukquOkznsExY9T1eCWD6YHuZmIvOhld_9j"> The more traffic among the churches, the better. Whenever we meet together, there is traffic. Without it, the churches are isolated. If we stay away from the meetings and meet together with just a few in our homes, the traffic is cut off. This is a subtlety of the enemy to cut the veins. When the blood flow is cut off, the result is death. However, by the proper traffic among the saints and between the churches, life multiplies. Therefore, we need to pay attention to Paul’s word concerning this matter in the <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89245" data-verses="Ephesians 6:1">last chapter</span> of Ephesians. <span class="pg" data-page-id="559" id="559">[559]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="od6p5sc1GDqOFwWB01GI4UNpHvyhwTvvTOTFDcnJar4LT8Qnqe8UcaKDTX05Qn6K7"> In speaking of Tychicus, Paul recommends him as a “beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord.” As a faithful servant in the Lord, Tychicus was a ministering servant. We have pointed out that he was sent to make all things known to the saints and to comfort their hearts. Once again I say that this reveals a sweet fellowship and intimate concern that need to be restored fully in the Lord’s recovery today. </p>

<p data-content-id="cUZm3R2OO3-xg87ohmxD-0kVfbXb4m8pa3KWJwuNiJOAyh8b5NcNgFoM_6ZG01679"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89246" data-verses="Ephesians 6:23-24">Verses 23 and 24</span> are Paul’s blessing: “Peace to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption.” In the opening of the book, the apostle’s greeting is with grace first as the enjoyment and then peace as the result of the enjoyment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89247" data-verses="Ephesians 1:2">1:2</span>). But at the conclusion it is the other way around, from the result, which is in peace, to the enjoyment of grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y7KPbnfhmVACkNVkC3njcSpl9kiFHRrpc5RUdAorxwk76X6_8r4-6ikKrq_X9AheN"> In his opening word Paul spoke only of grace and peace. In his concluding word, he not only changes the order of grace and peace, but also mentions “love with faith.” It is important to see why grace and peace are reversed and why love with faith was included. We have seen that grace is the enjoyment of the Lord and that peace is the result of this enjoyment. This book opens with grace, with the enjoyment of the Lord Himself as our life, life supply, and everything to us. But eventually this Epistle brings us into peace. However, after we have come into peace, we still need grace. We enter into peace through grace. Now as we are enjoying peace, we need more grace. This is grace upon grace. It also indicates that our experience is from grace to grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="EkaMV3Soowz1Y1LdwSAggraY_cxwo6M0H0MN5WrZ4ZYcDUwX2c921mm7c4iIL8IZY"> But why is love inserted between peace and grace? No other epistle written by Paul has such an insertion. The reason for this insertion is that the only way we can be kept in a situation of peace is by continually enjoying the Lord in love. The phrase “in love” is used six times in this book (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89248" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4">1:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89249" data-verses="Ephesians 3:17">3:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89250" data-verses="Ephesians 4:2">4:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89251" data-verses="Ephesians 4:15">15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89252" data-verses="Ephesians 4:16">16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89253" data-verses="Ephesians 5:2">5:2</span>). This connects this Epistle to Christ’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="560" id="560">[560]</span> word to the church in Ephesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89254" data-verses="Revelation 2:1-7">Revelation 2:1-7</span>. There the Lord rebukes the church because she left her first love (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89255" data-verses="Revelation 2:4">v. 4</span>). The problem with the church at Ephesus was not the lack of works or knowledge, but the loss of the first love. Because Paul realized that love is crucial, he spoke of love in relation to peace and grace, indicating thereby that love is needed to preserve us in a condition of peace. </p>
<p data-content-id="D20V42Q_F8EMHQVYOrygvO7d12B2o4EAp5I6xaxu5BS3a8z8gUxLYQQk1sl7LSiAO"> This love is from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. This indicates that love does not originate with us; it originates with God. Eventually, however, God’s love becomes our love. This is the reason Paul speaks, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89256" data-verses="Ephesians 6:24">verse 24</span>, of those who love our Lord Jesus Christ. God’s love to us becomes our love for Him. Peace is maintained by this kind of love. By living in the intimacy of God’s presence, love comes to us. Then this love returns to the Lord and becomes our love for Him. By this traffic of love, peace is maintained, and we are preserved in the enjoyment of grace. This is the reason Paul speaks of peace, love, and grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="S26jTFFVZnj955_hMlMnIhY03Mx0tdPkCD61VuHGKt4L3wCMJyIZ3UBt_LzbPLTVG"> Notice that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89257" data-verses="Ephesians 6:23">verse 23</span> Paul uses the phrase “love with faith.” Here, in contrast to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89258" data-verses="1Timothy 1:14">1 Timothy 1:14</span>, he does not speak of love and faith. Love and faith are the two means by which we partake of Christ and experience Him. Faith is related to our receiving of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89259" data-verses="John 1:12">John 1:12</span>), and love is related to our enjoying Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89260" data-verses="John 14:23">John 14:23</span>). In the Gospel of John we are firstly told to believe in the Son in order to have eternal life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89261" data-verses="John 3:15">3:15</span>). To believe in the Lord Jesus is to receive Him. The Gospel of John also emphasizes love. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89262" data-verses="John 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span> the Lord asks Peter concerning his love for Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89263" data-verses="John 21:15-17">vv. 15-17</span>). Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89264" data-verses="John 14:23">John 14:23</span> the Lord speaks of the Father and the Son making an abode with the one who loves the Lord Jesus. Therefore, by faith we receive the Lord Jesus and by love we enjoy Him. For this reason, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89265" data-verses="1Timothy 1:14">1 Timothy 1:14</span> Paul puts faith and love together. </p>

His purpose is not just to create man, to rescue him from his fallen condition, and to bring him to heaven. Furthermore, God’s purpose is not simply to have us be holy, spiritual, and victorious. Creation, salvation, sanctification, spirituality, and victory are all part of God’s procedure to reach His goal, but they are not the goal itself. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxii6sj2WAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy">GOD’S PURPOSE IN THE BEGINNING</h2><p data-content-id="MiS0T4a3KCiS0HGposEC8jSMnqKUKv0mQ1p8RXf91j3qhYPyaQ4vSp2OaxeR_yzEI"> In order to share in the recovery of the proper church life, we need to see what God’s purpose was in the beginning. We need to understand that there are three different beginnings. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89273" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> says, “In the beginning was the Word.” The beginning here is the beginning in eternity. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89274" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span> says, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Heb.). In this verse the beginning denotes the time of creation. Finally, the beginning also refers to the start of the church life. Therefore, to go back to the beginning is to go back to the beginning in eternity, to the beginning in God’s creation, or to the beginning of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fBFdNPVcEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z"> The book of Ephesians reveals that the church came into existence according to the eternal purpose which God purposed in Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89275" data-verses="Ephesians 3:11">Ephesians 3:11</span> says, “According to the purpose of the ages which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.” The purpose of the ages is the purpose of eternity, the eternal purpose, the eternal plan of God made in eternity past. This is the purpose made by God in eternity past for eternity future. God is a God of purpose. Before creation, before the foundation of the world, He made a plan. This plan is the purpose of the ages, or the eternal purpose. <span class="pg" data-page-id="564" id="564">[564]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="inTRR5aqA6f3Zp0g5VCt5vCksxBJYPP9fz0SGMS6TD8Ev1RYK0XGG-yq2bZI5h3Uz"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89276" data-verses="Ephesians 1:9">1:9</span> Paul says, “Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself.” This verse also speaks of God’s purpose, but here Paul uses the word purpose as a verb instead of as a noun. A good pleasure according to God’s will has been purposed by God in Himself. This will which He has purposed is a mystery. It was hidden in God; it was not revealed to the saints in the Old Testament. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89277" data-verses="Ephesians 1:11">1:11</span> Paul also speaks of God’s purpose: “In Whom also we were made an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One Who operates all things according to the counsel of His will.” God’s purpose in these verses refers to what God planned in the beginning, in eternity past. </p>
<p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQ4QI9umddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> In the beginning God planned to have the church. The Bible definitely reveals that this is God’s intention. God created the heavens, the earth, and billions of items because He desired to have the church. The first two chapters of Genesis are apparently a record of God’s creation. Actually these chapters reveal God’s intention. The minerals are for the plants, the plants are for the animals, the animals are for man, and man is for God. In other words, all things are for us, and we are for God in order that He may fulfill His desire to have the church. Therefore, God created all things so that He could have the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="pUgU6yw7JGTUYrgFoe8JTp3CTQJHSv7TrTsP0dxOoJBaWmsdb5vA9y_VoOGAtYpSI"> Furthermore, God’s redemption, regeneration, and calling are also for the church. God accomplished redemption so He could have the church. He also came to you, called you, and regenerated you for the church. Moreover, He dwells in you today for the sake of the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vNGdZHHY14iAb_v6HwIE3H6CGAnRdeE22cQi8F0_YUxRFUJ9ktsfg-XG_7irJOOpq">A DEFINITION OF THE CHURCH</h2><p data-content-id="WMnpS5Obzk_YTS3q3GOFH1SRkAwpMrnZYpJ1P_jLUOjwyCSv5ZbC6HMtrIdmASj5I"> Now we come to the crucial and difficult matter of giving a definition of the church. The church may be called a hybrid, because it is one entity produced by the mingling together of two lives. The two lives that are mingled to produce the church are the divine life and the human life. Therefore, the church is an entity constituted not just of the divine life or merely of the human life, but of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="565" id="565">[565]</span> divine-human life. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He lived a divine-human life. The church also has a divine-human life. We thank the Lord that although this has been hidden from the saints for centuries, He has revealed it to us in His recovery. </p>
<p data-content-id="2dq7QF0hlVfHljch6uMOWbrY58vUpD7PM_en5LHupWopm5T9JM8tlnCWOoNUSQNy6"> It is vital to see that the church is a hybrid produced by the mingling of the divine life with the human life. God desires to dispense Himself into man and to work Himself into man. In his book, <em>The Spirit of Christ,</em> Andrew Murray says that the divine life is interwoven with the human life. Although interwoven is a very good term, it is still not adequate. The divine life is not only interwoven with the human life, but the divine life and the human life are mingled to form one entity. Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89278" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> illustrates this. Here he says, “I have been crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me” (Gk.). Paul says that it is he who lives; yet it is not he, but Christ. This indicates the mingling of Christ with Paul. The church is the product of such a mingling. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="uRn6e8DCDhYvxWArZZyg1AAVbPaerbWQ-S4ajELiYI6nagGr9Sjsomhlk1pMnAffa">CHRISTIANS FOR THE CHURCH</h2><p data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4agOnKx5TOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1"> Just as the members of our body are for the body, not for the members themselves, so we have become Christians for the church. Without the body, the members have no meaning. In the same principle, without the church, we Christians have no purpose. Therefore, as Christians we must be for the church. </p>

This oneness is the church. The church is the oneness in the Triune God of all those who are mingled with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="XN29daXoEaiDc-NwR9H8WYCjBCQLaqlHCNZd9RwShWBkL98XRz-1aU8fWCfEcI9un"> The oneness in the Triune God is revealed in a full way in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89280" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89281" data-verses="John 17:21">John 17:21</span> the Lord Jesus prayed, “That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.” Here in this oneness there is no <span class="pg" data-page-id="566" id="566">[566]</span> place for the flesh, sin, naturalness, or worldliness. In this oneness there is room only for the proper humanity mingled with the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="kW37bRWd4n3ChsU9j6t193oeXSZGaNT7Km646Yo-l1oZoLWUehit8wxR0xamoxSLO"> Some may say that we do not have the proper humanity because of the fall. I agree. But through the redemption of Christ God has recovered us and uplifted our fallen humanity. In Christ’s resurrection our humanity has been uplifted. This resurrected and uplifted humanity is now mingled with the Triune God. This mingling is the very element of the church. In the proper church life there is no culture, religion, or worldliness. The church, on the contrary, is composed of the proper humanity, the humanity created by God and uplifted by Christ, mingled with the Triune God. This is the entity God planned to have in eternity past for eternity future. </p>

This is proved by what this book includes. Firstly, as we have seen, this book speaks of the purpose of the ages, the eternal purpose of God. Secondly, it mentions God’s creation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89282" data-verses="Ephesians 3:9">Ephesians 3:9</span> speaks of the “dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, Who created all things.” There is a relationship between creation and the church, for God created all things for the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="bx_UdsKHw-vHF3mnF2hC5zEtkzApCWM1-A9auvEbkRZG4a2E4SntYRIkifhdfEuRY"> God’s intention in His creation of all things, including man, was that man would be mingled with God to produce the church. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89283" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">Zechariah 12:1</span> says that the Lord stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. This indicates that the heavens are for the earth, that the earth is for man, and that man with the human spirit is for God. God’s marvelous creation, focused on man, is for the purpose of producing the church. Therefore, Ephesians speaks of the creation of all things. <span class="pg" data-page-id="567" id="567">[567]</span> </p>

In order to dispense Himself into man, God must be triune, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Furthermore, man must be in God’s image and have a spirit to receive God and assimilate Him. One day, the Son of God, the embodiment of the Father, became a man. Passing through human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit. As the Spirit, He comes into us and mingles with our spirit. Through this process there is brought into being a hybrid life, an entity composed of the mingling of the divine life with the human life. This is the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4G6WoOKDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> God is no longer the unprocessed God, but the processed God. He has accomplished everything necessary to come into us as the life-giving Spirit. Now we must believe in Him and call on the name of the Lord Jesus. When we do this, the life-giving Spirit comes into our spirit, and the mingling of the divine life and the human life takes place within us. This mingling produces the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAz2kTlEtH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9">THE FULLNESS OF GOD AND THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="wZZd7ZXC7lqDMlD_3-HJuDfLc2iwDM5RxitkD5PpVOrwkpldqqeIgnRv2-Kvi2tyM"> The book of Ephesians contains the fullest revelation of the Triune God in the Scriptures. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89300" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">chapter three</span> Paul speaks of the fullness of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89301" data-verses="Ephesians 3:19">v. 19</span>), the riches of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89302" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">v. 8</span>), and the power of the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89303" data-verses="Ephesians 3:16">v. 16</span>). The fullness implies that the riches of all that God is become His expression. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89304" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Colossians 2:9</span> says that the fullness of God dwells in Christ bodily. This means that Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of God, the embodiment of all that God is. When <span class="pg" data-page-id="572" id="572">[572]</span> the fullness of God is embodied in Christ, there are the riches of Christ. The riches of Christ are realized through the power of the Spirit. Hence, Christ is the embodiment of God’s fullness, and the Spirit is the realization of Christ’s riches. To have the fullness of God, we must have Christ. Furthermore, to enjoy the riches of Christ, we must have the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5e21ryt3O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6"> In the Gospel of John, the Spirit is called the Spirit of reality. The Spirit of reality makes real to the believers all that the Son is and has. Embodied in the Son is all that the Father is and has, and all that the Son is and has is revealed as reality to the believers through the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89305" data-verses="John 16:14-15">John 16:14-15</span>). For example, Christ is life. However, if we do not touch the Spirit, we cannot have this life. But as we touch the Spirit, we experience the reality of Christ as life. In like manner, Christ is light. But if we do not contact the Spirit, we cannot be enlightened by Christ. When we contact the Spirit, we enjoy the reality of Christ as light. </p>
<p data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6op6PdEvLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9"> Today our Triune God is the all-inclusive Spirit. Do not regard the Spirit as something other than Christ, nor think of Christ as separate from God the Father. No, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one. This is the reason that we refer to God as triune, as three in one. No one can adequately define the Trinity. God the Father is in God the Son, and God the Son has become the Spirit who gives life. For the sake of the church, the fullness of God is embodied in Christ that the riches of Christ may be made real to us through the Spirit. The more we contact the Spirit, the more we enjoy Christ’s riches. Eventually we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God and be fully mingled with the Triune God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="S26jTFFVZnj955_hMlMnIhY05Mx0ldPkCD61VuHGKt4L3wCMJyIZ3UBt_LzbPLTVG">ACCESS UNTO THE FATHER</h2><p data-content-id="gBi8-OiEa7te_n7JZc2wVW6gtMFH6ZhCfpqqsc2x3FtvD6W9167GIkeZns_JUH8SK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89306" data-verses="Ephesians 2:18">2:18</span> all Three of the Triune God are mentioned: “For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.” Through Christ the Son we have access in one Spirit unto the Father. How wonderful! Notice that this verse does not say that we have access unto the Spirit. It speaks of <span class="pg" data-page-id="573" id="573">[573]</span> access unto the Father. The Spirit is unto us, whereas we are unto the Father. The Father came to us in the Son, and the Son came into us as the Spirit. Now through the Son the Spirit brings us unto the Father. This is for the dispensing of the Triune God into us so that the church may come into existence. Once again we see that the church is produced by the mingling of the Triune God with humanity. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="e7TeZuy6ip5trkTcKOr38frNxDb6iup2tVAiVqlMGn0mLpxnTuxCJvbcyNlyALCaC">RESPONDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="5tbeNC7n4bELsmeplIXgNzT-qgwibKoF26Q5SKhmn5Z95j36NkbT_ysCBWMthTXfH"> The dispensing of the Triune God into man is altogether related to the Spirit. The processed God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is waiting for our spirit to respond to Him and to cooperate with Him. To be saved is not merely to understand the gospel. It is to open ourselves from the depths of our being to respond to the Spirit. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we must call from our spirit, from the depths of our being. If we do this, we shall be saved, even if we do not adequately understand the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyFr90i1ZOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi"> Consider the case of Saul of Tarsus on the way to Damascus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89307" data-verses="Acts 9:1">Acts 9</span>). He was saved by saying the words, “Who art Thou, Lord?” At the time he was saved, Saul was not so clear about the gospel, nor even about the Lord Jesus. However, simply by saying the words, “Who art Thou, Lord?” he was captured by the Lord. This shows that to be saved is not mainly a matter of understanding the gospel, but of contacting the life-giving Spirit, who is the processed God waiting for an opportunity to come into us. Contacting the life-giving Spirit is much like breathing. The important thing is not to understand the air, but to breathe the air into us. By breathing in the air, we receive all the benefits of the air. </p>
<p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyTjEtHUUr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> This principle applies to our whole Christian life. Take holiness as an example. We become holy not by learning the doctrine of holiness, but by contacting the Spirit who Himself is the essence of holiness. The doctrine of holiness is not holiness itself. Holiness is a living Person, the processed God as the life-giving Spirit. It is possible to know the doctrine of holiness without having the reality of holiness. The way to be holy is to contact the life-giving Spirit. We <span class="pg" data-page-id="574" id="574">[574]</span> may read a book on holiness, but have nothing of holiness as a result of our reading. However, if we spend the same amount of time calling on the name of the Lord as we would reading that book, we shall certainly experience God’s holiness. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8rOIawMSiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n">A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION</h2><p data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxii7sjnbAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy"> In the book of Ephesians there is great emphasis on the mingled spirit, the human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89308" data-verses="Ephesians 1:17">Ephesians 1:17</span> says, “That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.” There is disagreement among scholars concerning the translation of the Greek word for spirit in this verse. Some insist on capitalizing the word spirit, because they think that the spirit here is the Holy Spirit. Others believe that the spirit here must refer to the human spirit. Actually, the spirit in this verse is our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. It is the human spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit. Such a spirit is given to us by God so that we may have wisdom and revelation to know Him and His economy. Without the Holy Spirit, our spirit cannot be a spirit of wisdom and revelation. But as soon as the Holy Spirit is mingled with our spirit, our spirit becomes a spirit of wisdom and revelation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MiS0T4a3KCiS0HGposEC8jSMmqKJIv0mQ1p8RXf91j3qhYPyaQ4vSp2OaxeR_yzEI">GOD’S DWELLING PLACE IN OUR SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fBFcNPMfEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89309" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">2:22</span> Paul again refers to the mingled spirit: “In Whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.” Translators differ about this verse also, with some arguing that the spirit here is the divine Spirit and others, that it is the human spirit. Actually, it is the mingled spirit, the believers’ human spirit indwelt by God’s Holy Spirit. God’s Spirit is the indwelling One, not the dwelling place. The dwelling place is our spirit. God’s Spirit dwells in our spirit. The Holy Spirit is, therefore, the indwelling One, not the indwelt One. The dwelling place of God is in our spirit, the human spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="575" id="575">[575]</span> </p>

Furthermore, on the cross Christ crucified the old man, destroyed Satan, and dealt with the world. This means that on the cross Christ dealt with sin, with the old man including the old nature, with Satan, and with the world. However, not many Christians realize that on the cross Christ also dealt with the ordinances. Christ dealt with sins and with sin so that we might be saved. He dealt with our old nature in order to set us free from the old man. Moreover, Christ dealt with Satan so that we may be victorious and overcome the evil one. Finally, Christ dealt with the world, so that we may be holy, sanctified, separated from the world. But why did He deal with the ordinances? He dealt with them in order to create one new man. Christians do not see this point because they concentrate on personal salvation, sanctification, or victory, and pay no attention to the church. Even many Bible teachers <span class="pg" data-page-id="580" id="580">[580]</span> fail to point out that in Ephesians Christ abolished the ordinances in order that the church might be produced. This is one of the most important revelations the Lord has given to the church in recent days. Christ’s death was not only for our salvation, liberation, sanctification, and victory. His death was also to abolish the ordinances in order to create the church as the one new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="WMnpS5Obzk_YTS3q3GOFH1SVsAwMErnZYpJ1P_jLUOjwyCSv5ZbC6HMtrIdmASj5I"> Ordinances, commandments, and the law are in the same category.

The church is the mingling of the processed God with the proper humanity. Here in this mingling there are no ordinances, commandments, rules, or regulations. The more we are in the mingled spirit, in the mingling of the divine Spirit with the human spirit, the more we shall be set free from ordinances. </p>
<p data-content-id="ziHhFbwj9qduVCwT62zA_ZSqmUWFLVUD31ttVpb1c14zDjDyuEyTtvwQz3ufe66GN"> However, if we cling to ordinances, we shall be divisive. Christians have been divided mainly because of ordinances. Some denominations have been established because of ordinances. Do you have the confidence to say that you have no ordinances? Few of us can say this. The young people have their particular ordinances, and the older saints have <span class="pg" data-page-id="581" id="581">[581]</span> theirs. Most of the problems among the leading ones in the churches are caused by ordinances. </p>
<p data-content-id="a-sefdyyFRnPSiT6ZZ18Vpq5nG9JUTLq-KbZep_8kFXpjCLum-lwALY397Cqj_hpR"> Some Christians have an ordinance, for example, regarding speaking in tongues. After one meeting, a brother came to me very happy because he had not been bothered by a sister who had spoken in tongues in that meeting. I told this brother that even his happiness proved that he still had feelings about speaking in tongues. Hence, his reaction was not altogether positive. If he could be surrounded by those who spoke in tongues without having any feeling about it, that would prove that he had no ordinances concerning this matter. </p>

Without ordinances, it is impossible to have religion, for religion is composed of ordinances. But Christ does not want a religion. What He wants is the new man. Therefore, He abolished the ordinances on the cross. Some may prefer shouting in the meeting, whereas others prefer silence. But to be either for shouting or for silence is to have an ordinance. We should not be for either one or the other, but for the Spirit. However, according to our nature and upbringing, we are prone to have ordinances of one kind or another. But as long as there are ordinances, we do not have the reality of the church life. The church life does not consist of ordinances, but of the living Spirit. </p>

Christ on the cross abolished the ordinances in order to produce the church. Now that the ordinances have been abolished, the Spirit comes in to replace them. If we have ordinances, we do not have the Spirit. But if we have the Spirit, we shall not have ordinances. The cross <span class="pg" data-page-id="582" id="582">[582]</span> abolished the ordinances in order to give place to the Spirit in whom we have access unto the Father. Hence, the Spirit is the replacement of all ordinances. In the meetings we should not have an ordinance regarding shouting or quietness. As long as we are not in the Spirit, anything we do is an ordinance. </p>
<p data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUmGwoJQ_XNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0"> The church is neither an organization nor a religion, but the Body of Christ produced by the mingling of the divine Spirit with the human spirit. In the meetings we should not have rules and regulations; we should simply care to be in the Spirit. Do not be concerned about the arrangement of the chairs or about whether or not the sisters wear a head covering. To arrange the chairs in a particular way or to wear a head covering may be fine when done in the spirit. But to insist on these things is to make them ordinances. Anything we do in the meetings becomes an ordinance if we are not in the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="7_JcBoLt_f4p4TwS9GhdcDP2Y4eCL0dHgTG9jncdwDuWZJuJ-gcIVOYb7Z2qhulnR"> When Christ abolished the ordinances, He broke down the middle wall of partition (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89321" data-verses="Ephesians 2:14">2:14</span>). Now the separating wall of ordinances no longer exists. When I was young, I was strong in the matter of ordinances. But today I realize that God cares only for the divine Spirit in our human spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89322" data-verses="Ephesians 2:18">2:18</span> Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89323" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">verse 22</span>, of the human spirit. </p>

Those who advocate head covering may be very strong, using <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89325" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">1 Corinthians 11</span> as their scriptural ground.

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Jf0PJ3Yzh-Zban-Z3PEii4PXjX0b56DqyCleWzpwECAyBCCrwndk4EBUpamTJ1Vjs">THE WHOLE GOSPEL</h2><p data-content-id="ziHhFbwj9qduVCwT62zA_ZSqnUWcCVUD31ttVpb1c14zDjDyuEyTtvwQz3ufe66GN"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89346" data-verses="Ephesians 2:12">verse 12</span>, we once were apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers from the covenants of promise, without hope, and without God in the world. But in Christ Jesus we have become near in the blood of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89347" data-verses="Ephesians 2:13">v. 13</span>). The context proves that we have been brought near to one another. The Gentiles were far off from the Jews, and the Jews were far off from the Gentiles. But on the cross Christ broke down the middle wall of partition between them. Therefore, now in the blood of Christ the Jews and the Gentiles are made near to one another. It is true that the blood has brought us to God. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89348" data-verses="Ephesians 2:13">verse 13</span> Paul is not saying that we are brought near to God; he is saying that we are brought near to one another. This is part of the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="a-sefdyyFRnPSiT6ZZ18Vpq5mG9saTLq-KbZep_8kFXpjCLum-lwALY397Cqj_hpR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89349" data-verses="Ephesians 2:14">Verse 14</span> says that Christ is our peace. The peace here is not that between us and God, but that between us and other believers. In particular, it is the peace between the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers. Christ, our peace, has made the Jews and the Gentiles one, having broken down <span class="pg" data-page-id="588" id="588">[588]</span> the middle wall of partition that separated them. In His flesh He abolished the enmity, the law of commandments in ordinances, in order to create the two in Himself into one new man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89350" data-verses="Ephesians 2:14-15">vv. 14-15</span>). In this way He made peace between the Gentiles and the Jews. </p>
<p data-content-id="bx_UdsKHw-vHF3mnF2hC5zEptzAELWM1-A9auvEbkRZG4a2E4SntYRIkifhdfEuRY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89351" data-verses="Ephesians 2:16">verse 16</span> Paul goes on to say, “And might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, slaying the enmity by it.” Christ reconciled the Jews and the Gentiles to God in one Body. This indicates that reconciliation is a corporate matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="MiS0T4a3KCiS0HGposEC8jSIuqKJAv0mQ1p8RXf91j3qhYPyaQ4vSp2OaxeR_yzEI"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89352" data-verses="Ephesians 2:17">Verse 17</span> continues, “And coming, He preached the gospel of peace to you who were far off, and peace to those who were near.” The subject of this verse is Christ. On the day we heard the gospel, Christ came as the Spirit to preach to us the good news of the peace which He had accomplished on the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fBBUNPMXEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89353" data-verses="Ephesians 2:18-22">verses 18 through 22</span> we see that we now have access unto the Father, that we are fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the household of God, that we are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, that the whole building is growing together into a holy temple in the Lord, and that we also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit. All these verses indicate that the abolishing of the ordinances for the producing of the church is part of the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="inTRR5aqA6f3Zp0g5VCt5vCglxBsQPP9fz0SGMS6TD8Ev1RYK0XGG-yq2bZI5h3Uz"> Many of us can testify that without the church life our human life has no meaning. Although we have been saved and regenerated to become children of God, our daily life is meaningless without the church. Can you be satisfied simply with eating, sleeping, working, spending some time to pray and read the Bible, and then sometimes telling others about Christ? From my experience I can testify that if I do not have the church life, I have no desire to live. This indicates that even though we may be saved, we are lacking something vital if we do not have the church life in a practical way. The whole gospel, the perfect and ultimate gospel, must include the church life. Most Christians, however, do not have a complete gospel because they do not see that the <span class="pg" data-page-id="589" id="589">[589]</span> gospel includes the abolishing of the ordinances for the creation of the new man. Today we in the Lord’s recovery must preach not a partial gospel, but one that is complete, a whole gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQ8ZI9Pvddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> Many Christians preach only the first aspect of the gospel, redemption by the blood of Christ. Some also preach the second aspect, the matter of being saved by Christ’s life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89354" data-verses="Romans 5:10">Rom. 5:10</span>). Another aspect of the gospel is the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89355" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span> Paul said that grace had been given to him “to preach to the nations the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.” The final aspect of the gospel is what we have seen in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89356" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span>—the abolishing of the ordinances for the creation of the one new man, the church. Redemption, life, and the enjoyment of the riches of Christ are all for the church. Thus, the ultimate goal of the gospel is the church, the new man. We praise the Lord for showing us that, according to the book of Ephesians, the gospel includes the creation of the new man. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bDDrOVJW0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D">PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN</h2><p data-content-id="jzy56D5a4K14njv2OL9Qfpnw63HnN1Ab9R3e21WSu1YH0DQn4sk-OuELvP5dRJ2jv"> We have considered two negative things that damage the church life: ordinances and doctrine. Now we come to a third negative thing—the old man. Some Christians interpret the old man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89357" data-verses="Ephesians 4:22">4:22</span> as the old nature. It is true that the old man includes the old nature, but it also includes a great deal more. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89358" data-verses="Ephesians 4:22">Ephesians 4:22</span> indicates that the old man is all- inclusive: “That you have put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit.” Here Paul speaks of putting off, as regards our former manner of life, the old man. The former manner of life includes everything related to us: what we are, what we have, our family life, and our social life. Paul’s meaning here is that we must put off whatever we are, whatever we do, and whatever we have. We are to put off our very way of living. </p>
<p data-content-id="TS0vLm3wTVrzuTUulNHSpsNW3UDSyc-25mTg4xYz74KQnIYS77RmuCw_eSmkzr8AS"> The old man with all it includes is a damage to the church life. Wherever the old man is, there can be no church. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="590" id="590">[590]</span> means that what we are, what we have, and what we do make the church life an impossibility. </p>
<p data-content-id="nFupmXdU7v_F8Wz3VyT4gw6xOecWHqgfhZHMQs6SxdJFG3VrWN2G3kyhCMk9WVErP"> Ordinances, doctrine, and the old man are the three main negative things that damage the church life. If we have ordinances, the church life is gone. If we are occupied with doctrine, it will not be possible to have the proper church life. In addition, if we continue to live according to the old man, the church life will be seriously damaged, even terminated. However, if we have no ordinances or doctrines and if we put off the old man with his former manner of life, we shall have a marvelous church life, a church life that will be a miniature of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. In such a church life it is impossible to have division. </p>
<p data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR0wZBZ2OWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB"> I wish to say once again that in the Lord’s recovery we are not for ordinances or for doctrine. However, we have deep respect for the Word of God. By the Lord’s mercy, we would never break His Word. But we do not take the Bible as mere doctrine. To keep the Word in a living way is one thing, but to turn the revelations in the Word into doctrine is another. We need to take the Word as nourishment for growth in life. We should not take it as a book of doctrine and ordinances. Although I prefer to kneel down when I pray, I do not make this a formality or an ordinance that others are expected to follow. Rather, when I kneel to pray, I do so in spirit. </p>

The fact that we were chosen in eternity means that our salvation began before the foundation of the world and before time. The word chosen implies that some were selected and that others were not selected. Praise the Lord that we are among the chosen ones! If we turn to our spirit and contact the Lord regarding this matter, we shall realize that just as God is eternal, so His choosing of us was also related to eternity. </p>

The Greek word rendered predestinated means to be pre-marked, to be marked out beforehand. In eternity God, through His foresight, marked us out from among a vast number of people. Because we were marked out before the creation of the universe, we cannot escape from God. We may want to give Him up, but He will not give us up.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89388" data-verses="Ephesians 2:4">2:4</span> Paul speaks of the great love with which God loved us. He loved us even when we were dead in offenses and sins, when we were walking according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89389" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1-2">2:1-2</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89390" data-verses="Ephesians 5:25">5:25</span> Paul says that Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her. Therefore, we are not only the chosen and predestinated ones, but also the loved ones. </p>

If we run from Him temporarily, He will eventually bring us back to Himself. The fact that we cannot run from the Lord proves that we have been called by Him. </p>

But through the Lord’s death on the cross, we have been saved from our fallen situation and reconciled to God. Praise the Lord that now there is nothing separating us from Him! We may still be weak, but we are in a reconciled condition. When we are in fellowship with the Lord, we are happy. But when we lose touch with the Lord, we are sad. But whatever our feelings, we nevertheless have been reconciled to Him. </p>

Today we realize in experience this reality in our spirit through faith in the accomplished fact. If we exercise our spirit in a genuine way, we shall have the sense that we are sitting in the heavenlies looking down at the situation on earth. However, if we exercise our natural reason instead of our spirit, we shall have the sense that we are on earth.

Before we do this, let us look at some of the key verses in each chapter of Ephesians. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3GEuFAt2o9byg8MZDzK996mP_fHqPXg_LkbTuP-LW2tuU3xrWTByUo7lMUOiCI2ZU">GOD’S ULTIMATE GOAL</h2><p data-content-id="GJHsP88GHseo8rpjYyem_lGXRqQsz4KrNMLYo1DtwblC8XXjSuatQl8WDTK_MeK3O"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89448" data-verses="Ephesians 1:5">1:5</span> Paul says that we have been predestinated to sonship, that is, predestinated to become sons of God. In creation, God is our Creator, not our Father. None of us were born of Him in creation. The fact that God has predestinated us, or marked us out beforehand, to be His sons means that we have been predestinated to be born of Him. This implies that God must come into us and that we must receive His life and have a relationship with Him in life. Therefore, to be predestinated to sonship is to be predestinated to be born of God so that He may become our Father and that we may become His sons. </p>
<p data-content-id="cUZm3R2OO3-xg87ohmxD-0kRbbX-2m8pa3KWJwuNiJOAyh8b5NcNgFoM_6ZG01679"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89449" data-verses="Ephesians 1:6-7">1:6 and 7</span> we see that God has graced us in the Beloved and redeemed us in Him. Having become the object of God’s grace, we have been favored in Christ, and we have redemption through the blood of Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAzyuTlZlH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9"> By putting these verses together we can see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89454" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span> in a new way. We have been predestinated, we have been sealed, and we have received a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that we may know the Body. Selection, predestination, redemption, and sealing are not ends in themselves. All this is for the Body. We were chosen, predestinated, favored, graced, redeemed, and sealed for the Body. Furthermore, for the Body we have been given a spirit of wisdom and revelation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89455" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span> the Body is God’s ultimate goal. </p>
<p data-content-id="wZZd7ZXC7lqDMlD_3-HJuDfPW2ipKM5RxitkD5PpVOrwkpldqqeIgnRv2-Kvi2tyM"> In the past many of us heard sermons on predestination and redemption. We have also heard about being graced and sealed with the Spirit. But had you ever heard that God’s selection, predestination, favor, redemption, and sealing are all for the Body? </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5ey_ryI5O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6">THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6otwPdlgLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89456" data-verses="Ephesians 2:4-5">2:4 and 5</span> we see that even when we were dead in offenses, God made us alive together with Christ. Not only were we sinful, we were also dead. But God came in to enliven us. If He had redeemed us and forgiven us without enlivening us, God would have had a great many redeemed ones who were still in death. Praise Him that in addition to redeeming us He made us alive! </p>
<p data-content-id="ZF7iQ7T0lQJP8gtIC7nMKHRumLd4AgK5Boj8tqPtmmD8KvxV6FuuLU1d_HGholgwP"> He also created us into one new man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89457" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">2:15</span>). Furthermore, we have been given access to the Father in the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89458" data-verses="Ephesians 2:18">v. 18</span>). Finally, we are being built up into a dwelling place of God in our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89459" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">v. 22</span>). Just as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89460" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> ends with the Body, so <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89461" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">chapter two</span> concludes with the building up of God’s dwelling place. This indicates that we have been enlivened not just for the sake of being enlivened, but for the building up of God’s dwelling place. In other words, God made us alive for the church. His final word both in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89462" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89463" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">chapter two</span> concerns the church. At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89464" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span>, we have the church as Christ’s Body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89465" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">chapter two</span>, we have the church as the dwelling place of God in our spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="609" id="609">[609]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OUgZSb02SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH">NOT INDIVIDUAL SPIRITUALITY,<br/>BUT THE CHURCH</h2><p data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2etMbK13kgmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89466" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">3:8</span> Paul said that he preached the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel. Paul did not preach doctrine, not even the doctrine of the riches of Christ. What he preached was the riches of Christ themselves. Furthermore, in this chapter Paul prayed that we would be strengthened by the Spirit into our inner man so that Christ may make His home in our hearts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89467" data-verses="Ephesians 3:16-17">vv. 16-17</span>). The goal of this strengthening and indwelling is that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89468" data-verses="Ephesians 3:19">v. 19</span>). The result of this is glory to God in the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89469" data-verses="Ephesians 3:21">v. 21</span>). Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89470" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">chapter three</span>, like the preceding chapters, ends with the church. This means that the preaching of the unsearchable riches of Christ, the strengthening of our inner man, Christ making His home in our heart, and being filled unto all the fullness of God are not for our individual spirituality, but for the church. </p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89472" data-verses="Ephesians 4:15">4:15</span>, we need to grow up into Christ in all things. This growth is for the sake of the Body, the church. </p>

This filling surely is related to being filled unto all the fullness of God. Through the infilling we have the water in the Word to wash away our spots and wrinkles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89474" data-verses="Ephesians 5:26-27">vv. 26-27</span>). The result of this washing is that we are corporately sanctified. Sanctification is not primarily an individual matter, but a corporate matter, a matter for the Body. Moreover, in this chapter we see that Christ is nourishing and cherishing the Body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89475" data-verses="Ephesians 5:29">v. 29</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vNGdZHHY14iAb_v6HwIE3H6GNAndfeE22cQi8F0_YUxRFUJ9ktsfg-XG_7irJOOpq">PUTTING ON THE ARMOR TO BE GOD’S WARRIOR</h2><p data-content-id="WMnpS5Obzk_YTS3q3GOFH1SVvAwlKrnZYpJ1P_jLUOjwyCSv5ZbC6HMtrIdmASj5I"> Finally, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89476" data-verses="Ephesians 6:1">chapter six</span> Paul tells us to put on the whole armor of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89477" data-verses="Ephesians 6:11">v. 11</span>). We need to receive the sword of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="610" id="610">[610]</span> Spirit, which is the Word of God, by means of all prayer, praying at every time in spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89478" data-verses="Ephesians 6:18">v. 18</span>). This is for the church to be God’s warrior. </p>

Instead, there is just the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit working in our spirit to produce the Body, the new man. I hope that we all shall pray-read these verses until we see this vision of the church. Then we shall realize that God has predestinated us for this. We have been made alive for God’s dwelling place, and we enjoy the riches of Christ that we may be part of the church. The church is produced by the mingling of the Triune God with redeemed mankind. The church life is thus the corporate mingling of the divine Spirit with the human spirit. If we have Christ as our reality, we shall not have ordinances or forms, but we shall have only the experience of the living Christ in our spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4agKsKx1ROZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1">JUDAISM AS A CAUSE OF DEGRADATION</h2><p data-content-id="IYKcWTBZD2wraBqVv8VOsOtTednVKu5Z92lk4lPzJmdAd2biN-nCndK5RLnSYtepK"> If we study church history, we can learn how the church became degraded. Firstly, Satan used Judaism, a religion founded and formed according to God’s oracle, to corrupt the church. In his subtlety, Satan caused Judaism to creep into the church. We have seen that the church is an entity produced by the mingling of the Holy Spirit with the human spirit. In this entity there is no room for regulations, organization, forms, or doctrines. There is room only for the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit mingled with our spirit in a corporate way. The church on the day of Pentecost was like this. At that time, there were no so-called services or methods of worship. The saints were not preoccupied with doctrinal knowledge, and they were not under any kind of organization. On the day of Pentecost, there was no religion. There was only a group of people living in the mingled spirit and experiencing the genuine church life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="611" id="611">[611]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="HfUkPNVdvPc-TGtNi_PIz-vsx1zme3n27HnTj40Roiaxg_VGkAzUncYLNZiT2Ke0a"> Later, however, Judaism crept in with its forms and ordinances, especially the ordinances concerning circumcision, the Sabbath, and eating. Paul wrote the book of Galatians in order to deal with the damage caused by Judaism, by religion. </p>

Satan’s goal is to divide the Body of Christ through knowledge and doctrine and to destroy the functions of the members of the Body through organization, especially organization that issues in the clergy-laity system. This system has replaced the functions of the members of the Body. If Satan cannot keep people from the Lord, then he will seek to damage and corrupt the Body of Christ. God’s intention is not simply to save millions of people and then transport them into heaven. God’s intention in His eternal purpose is to have the Body to express Christ. He desires to have a number of genuine believers built up together in the life of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyFvw0ioXOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi">THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH TODAY</h2><p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyTnJtHNbr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> Due to the subtlety of Satan, many think that such a building can take place only in the future. According to this concept, all we can do today is preach the gospel, bring people to the Lord, and help them to know the Bible, to love the Lord, and to seek spirituality. Some Christian teachers say that, according to the type in the Old Testament, we are living in the age of David, in the time of fighting the battle and of making preparations for the building of the temple. Later, in the age of Solomon, the temple will be built up. However, this teaching annuls the book of Ephesians. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89497" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">2:22</span> Paul says, “In Whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.” This verse does not say that we shall be built up some day in the future; it says <span class="pg" data-page-id="620" id="620">[620]</span> plainly that we are being built even today. Hence, the building of the church is for today. </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8rKFawpeiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89498" data-verses="Ephesians 4:11-12">4:11 and 12</span> we see that the Lord has given apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints unto the building up of the Body of Christ. This also indicates that the building of the church is taking place today. </p>
<p data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxim2sjGWAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89499" data-verses="Ephesians 4:16">Ephesians 4:16</span> offers further proof of this. Here we see the growth that is unto the building up of the Body. The operation in the measure of each part causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. Paul’s word clearly indicates that the growth which is unto building is taking place today. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9XsVFU_TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> Certain Christian teachers evade the issue of the present building up of the Body because they know that they are in a situation in which it is impossible to have the church life. They are in division. They can merely shake hands over the denominational fences and say to one another that they are one in Christ. This, however, is a false oneness, a oneness in pretense. Therefore, they excuse their situation by saying that it is impossible for the church to be built up today. They follow the teaching that the building of the church will be only in the future. This is the subtlety of Satan. </p>

I believe that the main reason for the delay of the Lord’s coming back is that His church has not yet been built up. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89500" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> the Lord Jesus promised and prophesied, “I will build My church.” This word must be fulfilled before the Lord comes back. Otherwise, concerning the building of the church, He would be put to shame. Satan would be able to boast of defeating the Lord. Then Satan would be able to say to the Lord Jesus, “For nearly two thousand years You have been trying to build the church, but You have not been successful. Your work on the cross, in <span class="pg" data-page-id="621" id="621">[621]</span> resurrection, in ascension, and as the life-giving Spirit has not been sufficient to defeat me. You have not reached Your goal.” The Lord Jesus will not allow Satan to boast in this way. He will put him to shame through the building up of the church, even in the midst of this dark age. Then the Lord will be able to boast to Satan, “Satan, even in such a dark and evil age, I have built My church.” </p>
<p data-content-id="ORuveXsLSL_KAUQRmmsRwUAzixfJgsZhadewDeZFVr0RNBcjRKpEUgJ7ZofkxfD26"> The Lord is doing a marvelous work of recovery.

People are helped to be saved, to become religious, to pursue spirituality, and to desire a closer walk with the Lord. But where is the Body? It seems that so many Christians do not see that in the book of Ephesians the church is emphasized. In his subtlety the enemy, Satan, has used various good things such as fundamental doctrine to damage the church. We must stand against the degradation of today’s Christianity. In doing this, we do not fight against people, but against the Devil, the subtle one. </p>
<p data-content-id="3GEuFAt2o9byg8MZDzK996mP4fH3DXg_LkbTuP-LW2tuU3xrWTByUo7lMUOiCI2ZU"> Because the Lord is sovereign, He cannot be defeated. Even today He is fulfilling His purpose. In the Lord’s recovery we are not for religion, knowledge, organization, rituals, forms, or regulations; we are only for the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit. As we enjoy the mingled spirit in a corporate way, we have the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="GJHsP88GHseo8rpjYyem_lGXWqQ1-4KrNMLYo1DtwblC8XXjSuatQl8WDTK_MeK3O"> The book of Ephesians reveals various aspects of the church.

We, the believers, were reconciled not only <em>for</em> the Body of Christ, but also <em>in</em> the Body of Christ. We all have been reconciled in the one Body. As we have seen, the gifted persons are for the building up of the Body, and the Body is growing unto the building up of itself in love. </p>

This new man is corporate and universal. There are many believers, but there is only one new man in the universe. All the believers are components of this corporate and universal new man. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89504" data-verses="Ephesians 4:13">4:13</span>, we are to grow up until we arrive at a full-grown man, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89505" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">4:24</span> we see that, in a practical way, we need to put on the new man. </p>

This aspect reveals that the church comes out of Christ, as Eve came out of Adam (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89507" data-verses="Genesis 2:21-22">Gen. 2:21-22</span>). The church has the same life and nature as Christ and becomes one with Him to be His counterpart, as Eve became one flesh with Adam (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89508" data-verses="Genesis 2:24">Gen. 2:24</span>). Eventually, as Eve went back to Adam and was presented to him, so the church will go back to Christ and be presented to Him as His Bride. </p>

Both the Jewish and Gentile believers are members of God’s house, which is a matter of life and enjoyment. All believers were born of God into His house to enjoy His riches. <span class="pg" data-page-id="623" id="623">[623]</span> </p>

The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89511" data-verses="John 3:5">John 3:5</span>) and are in the church life, living in the kingdom of God today (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89512" data-verses="Romans 14:17">Rom. 14:17</span>). </p>

As we consider God’s economy as revealed in the book of Ephesians, we need to pray that the Lord will give us an open heaven with a clear sky. If we would know God’s economy, not only must we have the knowledge of the book of Ephesians; we must also touch the reality contained in this book. We are not for mere knowledge—we are for reality. The reality in the book of Ephesians is God’s economy concerning Christ with the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="TS0vLm3wTVrzuTUulNHSpsNWzUDP-c-25mTg4xYz74KQnIYS77RmuCw_eSmkzr8AS">SOME IMPORTANT TERMS</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="nFupmXdU7v_F8Wz3VyT4gw6xKecPKqgfhZHMQs6SxdJFG3VrWN2G3kyhCMk9WVErP">Economy</h2>
<p data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR0wdBZTMWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB"> In relation to God’s purpose, the word economy is unfamiliar to many Christians. The Greek word for economy, <em>oikonomia</em>, is used three times in Ephesians. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89524" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">1:10</span> Paul speaks of a dispensation, or economy, of the fullness of the times, in which all things will be headed up in Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89525" data-verses="Ephesians 3:2">3:2</span> he speaks of the stewardship of the grace of God, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89526" data-verses="Ephesians 3:9">3:9</span>, of the dispensation of the mystery. The English word economy is an anglicized form of <em>oikonomia,</em> which means administration, stewardship, arrangement, or dispensation. In particular, in this sense economy denotes dispensing. God’s economy is to dispense Himself into His chosen people. Apart from Himself, God has nothing to dispense into His chosen ones. Hence, His economy is to dispense Himself into us. This is altogether related to Christ with the church. <span class="pg" data-page-id="630" id="630">[630]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4C2Wo-KDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu">Will</h2><p data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2etMdK13sgmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg"> Besides the term economy, a number of other important terms are used by Paul in Ephesians. Three times in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89527" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> Paul mentions God’s will: the good pleasure of His will (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89528" data-verses="Ephesians 1:5">v. 5</span>), the mystery of His will (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89529" data-verses="Ephesians 1:9">v. 9</span>), and the counsel of His will (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89530" data-verses="Ephesians 1:11">v. 11</span>). God has an economy because He has a will. In eternity God planned a will. This will was hidden in Him. Hence, it was a mystery. In His wisdom and prudence He has made this hidden mystery known to us through His revelation in Christ, that is, through Christ’s incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiEzor6jm8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND">Good Pleasure</h2><p data-content-id="P5LAppNM9anuOY8qKFZGxcanxXKRFW6wXX1IPiDZBj9REBKOwCbu8774faHM2uakW"> Another important term is “good pleasure” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89531" data-verses="Ephesians 1:5">1:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89532" data-verses="Ephesians 1:9">9</span>). God has a will in which is His good pleasure. This good pleasure refers to the delight of God’s heart. The book of Ephesians speaks from the standpoint of the good pleasure of God’s heart. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89533" data-verses="Ephesians 1:9-10">1:9 and 10</span>, God’s good pleasure is what He has purposed in Himself for an administration. In human terms, God’s good pleasure is that which makes Him happy. There is something within God’s heart that pleases Him and makes Him happy. This is God’s good pleasure. Do not think that the term “good pleasure” is insignificant. On the contrary, it is a very important term in Ephesians. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="-xjGehvejCQlzalTuo32KU2HXU9jWuPgtsH4FEYaUB1lCP61PJ3xPUdWBlbNL_kSt">Purpose</h2><p data-content-id="pUgU6yw7JGTUYrgFoe8JTp3GeQJHWv7TrTsP0dxOoJBaWmsdb5vA9y_VoOGAtYpSI"> In Ephesians the word purpose is used three times, twice as a noun and once as a verb. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89534" data-verses="Ephesians 1:11">1:11</span> Paul says that we have been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who operates all things according to the counsel of His will. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89535" data-verses="Ephesians 3:11">3:11</span> Paul speaks of the purpose of the ages. The purpose of the ages is the purpose of eternity, the eternal purpose, the eternal plan of God made in eternity past. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89536" data-verses="Ephesians 1:9">1:9</span> the word purpose is used as a verb: “Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself.” God has a purpose. Here the word purpose is the equivalent of the English word plan. God has <span class="pg" data-page-id="631" id="631">[631]</span> a plan which He made in eternity. God has a plan because He has a will, a good pleasure, and an economy. According to His economy, He made a plan, a purpose. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="vNGdZHHY14iAb_v6HwIE3H6GLAnRZeE22cQi8F0_YUxRFUJ9ktsfg-XG_7irJOOpq">Counsel</h2><p data-content-id="WMnpS5Obzk_YTS3q3GOFH1SVpAwpIrnZYpJ1P_jLUOjwyCSv5ZbC6HMtrIdmASj5I"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89537" data-verses="Ephesians 1:11">1:11</span> Paul uses the word counsel, saying that God operates all things according to the counsel of His will. When God created man, a conference was held within the Godhead. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89538" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> says, “And God said, Let us make man in our image.” God took counsel with Himself. This counsel is related to His will. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="2dq7QF0hlVfHljch6uMOWbrc08vUtD7PM_en5LHupWopm5T9JM8tlnCWOoNUSQNy6">Mystery</h2><p data-content-id="uRn6e8DCDhYvxWArZZyg1AARWPaenbWQ-S4ajELiYI6nagGr9Sjsomhlk1pMnAffa"> Still another crucial word in Ephesians is mystery. As we have seen, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89539" data-verses="Ephesians 1:9">1:9</span> mentions the mystery of God’s will. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89540" data-verses="Ephesians 3:3">3:3</span> Paul says, “That by revelation the mystery was made known to me.” God’s hidden purpose is the mystery, and the unveiling of this mystery is revelation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89541" data-verses="Ephesians 3:4">3:4</span> Paul goes on to speak of the “mystery of Christ.” The mystery of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89542" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">Colossians 2:2</span> is Christ, whereas the mystery of Christ here is the church. God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God. Christ is also a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express Him, is the mystery of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4agKqKx5fOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89543" data-verses="Ephesians 3:9">3:9</span> Paul speaks of bringing to light the “dispensation of the mystery.” God’s mystery is His hidden purpose. His purpose is to dispense Himself into His chosen people. Hence, there is a dispensation of the mystery of God. This mystery was hidden in God from the ages (that is, from eternity) and through all past ages, but now it has been brought to light to the New Testament believers. God’s intention is to make known the dispensation, the economy, of His mystery. </p>
<p data-content-id="IYKcWTBZD2wraBqVv8VOsOtTYdnVCu5Z92lk4lPzJmdAd2biN-nCndK5RLnSYtepK"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89544" data-verses="Ephesians 5:32">Ephesians 5:32</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89545" data-verses="Ephesians 6:19">6:19</span> also use the term mystery. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89546" data-verses="Ephesians 5:32">5:32</span> Paul says, “This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.” The fact that Christ and the church are one spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89547" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>), as typified by the husband and wife who are one flesh, is the great mystery. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89548" data-verses="Ephesians 6:19">6:19</span> Paul speaks of making known in boldness the “mystery <span class="pg" data-page-id="632" id="632">[632]</span> of the gospel.” This mystery is Christ and the church for the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="HfUkPNVdvPc-TGtNi_PIz-vs31zmW3n27HnTj40Roiaxg_VGkAzUncYLNZiT2Ke0a">A SECRET</h2><p data-content-id="XN29daXoEaiDc-NwR9H8WYCnMCQHQqlHCNZd9RwShWBkL98XRz-1aU8fWCfEcI9un"> It is important that we remember these crucial terms: will, good pleasure, purpose, counsel, economy, and mystery. On the one hand, these terms are deep and profound, and it would take years to understand them adequately. On the other hand, there is a simple secret to grasping their significance. This secret is Christ with the church. God’s will is to have Christ with the church. Likewise, God’s good pleasure and God’s purpose are to have Christ with the church. We have already pointed out that Christ with the church is God’s economy. Furthermore, God counseled with Himself to have Christ with the church. God’s mystery is also related to Christ with the church. Therefore, Christ with the church is the secret to understanding these crucial terms. What is God’s will? It is Christ with the church. What is God’s good pleasure? Christ with the church is His good pleasure, the delight of His heart. Furthermore, God’s purpose in eternity and for eternity is Christ with the church. Likewise, God’s counsel, economy, and mystery are all related to Christ with the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="kW37bRWd4n3ChsU9j6t193oaaSZKQNT7Km646Yo-l1oZoLWUehit8wxR0xamoxSLO">HOW GOD FULFILLS HIS ECONOMY</h2><p data-content-id="Jf0PJ3Yzh-Zban-Z3PEii4PXnX0K36DqyCleWzpwECAyBCCrwndk4EBUpamTJ1Vjs"> Since God’s economy is Christ with the church, we need to consider how He carries out this economy and fulfills it. Oh, may the Lord blow away all the clouds and give us a clear sky concerning this! Regarding the accomplishment of God’s economy, the sky over all the saints in all the local churches needs to be crystal clear. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ziHhFbwj9qduVCwT62zA_ZSqjUWJNVUD31ttVpb1c14zDjDyuEyTtvwQz3ufe66GN">Selection</h2><p data-content-id="a-sefdyyFRnPSiT6ZZ18Vpq5iG9FWTLq-KbZep_8kFXpjCLum-lwALY397Cqj_hpR"> The first step in the working out of God’s economy was God’s selection. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89549" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span> says, “According as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before Him, in love.” In eternity past, before the foundation of the world, God selected <span class="pg" data-page-id="633" id="633">[633]</span> us. His choosing is His selection. From among innumerable people, He selected us. This He did in Christ. Christ was the sphere in which we were selected by God. Outside of Christ we are not God’s choice. This took place in eternity past. God chose us according to His infinite foresight before He created us. </p>
<p data-content-id="bx_UdsKHw-vHF3mnF2hC5zEppzApGWM1-A9auvEbkRZG4a2E4SntYRIkifhdfEuRY"> Have you ever been impressed with the fact that God chose you in Christ before the foundation of the world? Whenever I think of God choosing me in eternity past, I am filled with worship and praise to Him. I do not need to be chosen by man, for I have been chosen by the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="qrCoreirL3MU0e6xc6vji8PBsGrElz5zIOcWFV4v-HiHK0TVU2I9mwTIzwi4vYBpQ"> Christians often say to the Lord, “O Lord, we did not first love You. You were the One who first loved us.” However, concerning God’s selection, we need to say, “Lord, we didn’t choose You—You chose us.” We all need to thank the Lord for His eternal selection, the selection made in eternity past for eternity future. We have been selected not to occupy a position of prominence in the world, but to be in the church. God’s selection was for the church. </p>

God’s intention is to dispense Himself into His chosen people. To be saved is not merely to have our sins forgiven, to be justified, and to be made ready for heaven. To be saved is for God to begin dispensing Himself into us. </p>

According to the natural concept, we think that after salvation we need to improve our behavior, seek power, or carry on a fruitful work for the Lord. Some Christians believe that they need to pursue such gifts as speaking in tongues, prophecy, and healing. Others feel that the most important thing for a saved one is to gain the proper knowledge of the Bible. However, if we view salvation from the perspective of God’s economy, we shall see the Christian life in a different way. </p>
<p data-content-id="P5LAppNM9anuOY8qKFZGxcanyXK0NW6wXX1IPiDZBj9REBKOwCbu8774faHM2uakW"> The New Testament does speak of proper conduct, power, gifts, and knowledge. Nevertheless, the crucial point is how much of Christ has been wrought into us. God is seeking to work Christ into us. We all need to be enlightened to see what God is doing today. God’s intention is not to improve us. Whatever we are in ourselves means nothing to God. What matters to Him is that Christ is wrought into us. </p>

Surely you would repent and ask the Lord to forgive you for your poor attitude. You may even pray that the Lord will make you better. Even if you do not make this request specifically, deep within this is your feeling as you pray about your failure. This kind of prayer is religious. You may have read the book <em>Christ versus Religion,</em> but you are still very religious in your daily practice. If you see God’s economy, you will pray like this, “Lord, the Devil within me caused me to behave in that way. But, Lord, even if my behavior had been good, it still would not have been You living within me. Lord, You do not want me to be good—You want to live in me. Lord, in one sense, I do repent and ask You to forgive me. But I also put the blame on Satan and command him to get away from me. Lord, I will not try to be better. I just need You to live in me.” </p>

To recite <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89571" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> is one thing, but to live out Christ in a practical way is another. </p>

You may not sense any need to repent or ask the Lord to forgive you. Nevertheless, according to God’s evaluation, it makes little difference whether you are kind or unkind toward others as long as you are the one living and not Christ. Whether our behavior is good or bad, we still do not live out Christ. God’s economy is focused on Christ. His economy is not a matter of ethics, morality, or good character. In His economy God desires to work Christ into us. In our relationships with the brothers and sisters in the church, we need to live out Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="S26jTFFVZnj955_hMlMnIhYw2Mx0hdPkCD61VuHGKt4L3wCMJyIZ3UBt_LzbPLTVG"> Some books have been written about Christ as life. However, it is difficult to find a group of Christians who genuinely live by Christ. God’s intention is not to improve us; it is to work the living Christ into us, into our mind, <span class="pg" data-page-id="639" id="639">[639]</span> emotion, and will. God’s desire is to replace us with Christ. He wants to see that Christ is being lived out of the brothers and sisters in the churches. Oh, may the Father of glory give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that we may be enlightened to know what God is seeking to accomplish today. I repeat, God is not seeking to improve us—He is endeavoring to work Christ into us. </p>

Satan put Christ on the cross. But God raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenlies. Now God intends to work this crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ into us. There is a great difference between ethics, conduct, and behavior, on the one hand, and such a Christ wrought into our being, on the other. </p>

For example, there has been much disputation about baptism, head covering, foot-washing, and about loudness or quietness in Christian meetings. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89572" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">Galatians 6:15</span> Paul says, “For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation” (Gk.). Forms and regulations do not avail anything, because they are not Christ. Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is the new creation that is in Christ Jesus. The new creation that Paul refers to is Christ wrought into our being. When Christ is wrought into us, a new creation takes place within us. Furthermore, this new creation is not merely an individual matter; it is a corporate matter involving the corporate entity of the new man, the Body of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyFvy0i1VOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi"> God’s concern is not foot-washing, the length of our hair, or how many times we have been baptized. God cares about how much of Christ has been wrought into us. God is not concerned whether or not we are humble or proud, crude or gentle. He cares only that Christ is wrought into our being. Again and again I wish to proclaim that God cares only for Christ. Morality, ethics, forms, and regulations <span class="pg" data-page-id="640" id="640">[640]</span> cannot produce a church that matches Christ. Only Christ Himself wrought into us can produce a church to match Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyTnLtHUYr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> The church is the Body of Christ. Only what comes out of Christ can be part of the Body of Christ. This means that mere gifts, teachings, and power cannot produce the Body. Nothing other than Christ wrought into the saints can produce the Body of Christ. Our eyes need to be enlightened to see this vision. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89573" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span> Paul prayed in a specific way, asking that our inner eyes be enlightened so that we may see that God’s intention is to work Christ into us. God does not desire to adjust us or to improve us. His intention is to work Christ into us. </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8rKHawAUiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> In a very real sense, we need to repent more of our goodness than of our evil. When you are good to your wife in a natural way, you need to repent and say, “Lord, forgive me. This is not Christ. In myself I may be good, but I am not living by Christ. Lord, I am good in a natural way, but I do not give You the opportunity to live out of me.” We all are full of regret when we do things that are bad, but we may not realize that we need to be even more repentant when we do good things apart from Christ. </p>

We are God’s workmanship. This indicates that God does not expect us to work for Him. On the contrary, He is seeking the opportunity to work upon us. If we consider our situation, we shall realize how much work remains to be done on us. God does not need us to work for Him. Rather, He will work on us until we become His masterpiece. We, the church, are the masterpiece of God’s work, expressing God’s infinite wisdom and divine design. The reason we are God’s masterpiece is that Christ is being wrought into us. We can boast to God’s creation that we have Christ in us. The more Christ is <span class="pg" data-page-id="641" id="641">[641]</span> wrought into us, the more we become part of God’s workmanship, God’s masterpiece. </p>

Apart from Christ, no one has been able to overcome death and come out from among the dead. For Christ to be raised up out of death indicates that nothing can hold Him down. When death comes to visit us, we cannot refuse it, for death has the power to hold us. But it did not have the power to hold Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89597" data-verses="Acts 2:24">Acts 2:24</span>). After visiting the realm of the dead for three days, Christ came forth in resurrection. Although death did everything possible to hold Him, Christ could have said, “Death, is this all you can do to Me? If this is all, then it is time for Me to walk away from you in resurrection.” </p>

When some hear this, they may accuse us of heresy. But consider the typology in the book of Leviticus. In this book five main offerings are described: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. These offerings typify Christ in various aspects. Even with one kind of offering, such as the burnt offering, there are different types of sacrifices. One could offer as a burnt offering a bullock, a lamb, or a bird. All these are types of Christ. This gives us the ground to say that in our experience the Christ we enjoy may be different from the Christ enjoyed by others. The Christ I experience may be different from the Christ you experience, and the Christ you enjoy may differ from the Christ enjoyed by others. </p>

Firstly, He descended from heaven to earth in His incarnation. Then He descended further, from earth to Hades, the lower parts of the earth, in His death. Eventually, He ascended from Hades to earth in His resurrection, and from earth to heaven in His ascension. Through such a journey, He cut the way that He might fill all things. When Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="649" id="649">[649]</span> ascended up on high, to the third heaven, that was not the end of His traveling. After He ascended, He descended into our spirit.

As the new man, the church must have Christ both as the life and as the person. Only in recent years has the aspect of the church as the new man been recovered. We thank the Lord that He has shown us clearly through the book of Ephesians that the church is the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="8h6Q8qq7fu5OpgOocEN7CqtThk5fV-y1o55tduWJ4FjR4dq0idwixNOYWvRUriXAE"> During the past two centuries, many Christians have seen that the church is the Body of Christ. In particular, the Brethren speak of this aspect of the church. Furthermore, since the end of World War II, many in this country have begun to talk about the Body. Today it is common to hear terms such as Body ministry. However, although the church is the Body of Christ, this is not the highest revelation of the church. We must go on to see the church as the new man. </p>

Through His death on the cross, not only did Christ deal with sin, the old man, the flesh, the world, and the Devil; He also dealt with the law of the commandments in ordinances. Many good messages have been given on how the cross of Christ has dealt with sin, the old man, the flesh, the world, and the Devil. But have you ever heard that on the cross Christ abolished the law of commandments in ordinances? Christ did <span class="pg" data-page-id="654" id="654">[654]</span> this not for salvation, sanctification, or even victory. He abolished the ordinances in order to create the new man. We freely admit that sin, the old man, the flesh, the world, and the Devil all needed the dealing of the cross, and we praise the Lord that all these negative things have been crucified. But we must go on to see the crucial importance of Christ’s abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances in order to create us into one new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="_gz5R_nH5oLy8-la4zwars71fBApQijurKKMBUDGJR9KRsTuy0qXMYueEupKE4DZW"> The fact that the Jews and the Gentiles have been created into one new man indicates that the new man is an entity that is corporate and universal. There are many believers, but there is just one new man. All the believers are part of this one corporate and universal new man. The highest revelation of the church given in the book of Ephesians is that of the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyFv80i1dOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi"> To be regenerated is not only to be saved; it is also to be created anew. On the cross Christ abolished the ordinances so that a re-creation could take place. The Jews and the Gentiles were separated by ordinances. But the two peoples have been created in Christ with the divine essence into one new entity, the corporate new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyTnFtHUQr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> Ordinances are the various forms or ways of living and worship. For example, the Jews have their particular way of worshipping God. Based upon this way of worship, they have ordinances that govern their daily living. Other peoples also have their own ways of living and worship. This is true among the denominations in today’s Christianity. The Baptists, Presbyterians, Methodists, Lutherans, and Episcopalians all have different ways of worship. How widespread is this matter of ordinances, and how all-pervading! </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8rKJawMWiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> God’s intention is not to have a certain kind of worship. His desire is to have the one new man. However, in his subtlety, Satan, the enemy of God, uses ordinances to damage the new man and to keep believers from realizing the new man in a practical way. Satan’s goal is not to keep Christians from heaven or from pursuing spirituality; it is to keep them from seeing and experiencing the church as the one new man. <span class="pg" data-page-id="655" id="655">[655]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxim6sjnfAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy"> We thank the Lord that He has made us very clear regarding the ground of the church. But it is not adequate simply to know the church ground. Although the ground of the church is necessary, God’s desire is not merely to have the church ground. He desires to have the church as the new man. Ordinances are the main obstacles to the fulfillment of this desire of God. If we would have the church in the aspect of the new man, we need to lay aside our ways of living. On the cross, Christ abolished all the ordinances. However, He did so not merely for the purpose of eliminating ordinances; He abolished the ordinances in order to create the one new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="MiS0T4a3KCiS0HGposEC8jSInqKJEv0mQ1p8RXf91j3qhYPyaQ4vSp2OaxeR_yzEI"> In His wisdom God has chosen us out of every tribe, tongue, people, and nation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89608" data-verses="Revelation 5:9">Rev. 5:9</span>). In the local churches today there are believers from many races and nationalities. Surely the greatest test of whether or not we take Christ as our life and as our person is related to ordinances. For example, it is difficult for the Chinese who have moved to this country from the Far East to realize the church as the new man because it is not easy to set aside their Chinese way of living. When certain Chinese brothers and sisters were in the Far East, they were more useful in the church life than they are now because now they hold on to their Chinese ordinances. To be fair, we need to point out that all of us have the problem of holding on to our ordinances. In the new man there is no room for Jew, Greek, barbarian, Scythian, circumcision or uncircumcision. This means that in the church as the new man there can be no Chinese, American, British, German, or any other nationality. There is room only for Christ. It is crucial for us all to see that more than nineteen hundred years ago all our ordinances were abolished by Christ on the cross. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fBBdNPMTEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z">THE NEED FOR PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE</h2><p data-content-id="inTRR5aqA6f3Zp0g5VCt5vCgsxBsUPP9fz0SGMS6TD8Ev1RYK0XGG-yq2bZI5h3Uz"> If we sincerely desire to take Christ as our life and as our person, we must let go of our ordinances. For example, we should not have an ordinance about hair styles. Rather, we should contact the Lord concerning this and pray, “Lord <span class="pg" data-page-id="656" id="656">[656]</span> Jesus, I am one of Your members. What kind of haircut do You want to have? I don’t care for any way of worship or living, and I am not concerned about customs or habits. Lord, I only care that You be my life and my person.” Spontaneously the living Lord Jesus will let you know how you should cut your hair. Then you simply act according to what He shows you. This is not an ordinance; it is a practical experience of taking Christ as your person. </p>
<p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQ8QI9Prddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> Our need today is not doctrinal knowledge, but the practical and daily experience of taking Christ as our person. In 1970 we first began to speak of the church as the new man. At that time we pointed out that in order to have the church in the aspect of the new man, we need to take Christ as our person. Since that time, there has been much talk about the new man and about taking Christ as our person. Even some good hymns have been written along this line. But according to my observation, there is little reality among us of actually taking Christ as our person. We should not be satisfied if others regard us as good people. We must be those who take Christ as our person. May we all go to the Lord and have a thorough transaction with Him concerning all the details of our daily living. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bDDiOVJa0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D">RECEIVING CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="jzy56D5a4K14njv2OL9Qfpnwz3HnB1Ab9R3e21WSu1YH0DQn4sk-OuELvP5dRJ2jv"> In many respects we are still quite religious. Even the way we preach the gospel and help others to be saved may be carried out in a religious way. We may tell people that they are sinful and that Christ died on the cross for their sins. We may go on to say that if they believe in Him, they will be forgiven, justified, saved, and made ready for heaven. In a sense such gospel preaching is good, fundamental, and even scriptural. However, it may be religious. The important factor in the preaching of the gospel is to help people open to the Lord Jesus and take Him into them. Even if a person has no concept of forgiveness, justification, or heaven, he will have the reality of all these if he takes Christ into him. When we have Christ, we have forgiveness, redemption, justification, salvation, and sanctification. <span class="pg" data-page-id="657" id="657">[657]</span> </p>

Although all genuine Christians recognize that Christ is the Son of God, not many have an adequate realization that He is the embodiment of God. To say that Christ is the embodiment of God means that in Christ is embodied all that God is. In eternity past, God in Christ made a plan, selected us, and predestinated us, or marked us out. Then in Christ and through Christ God created all things. Eventually, Christ was incarnated, accomplished redemption through crucifixion, was buried, resurrected, and then ascended to the third heaven. Furthermore, He has descended as the Spirit upon His Body. Now He is waiting for people to open to Him and call upon Him so that He may come into them, regenerate them, and make His home in their hearts. One day, He will come back from the heavens by coming out from within His people. Then He will be the King over all the earth, and His chosen people will be co-kings with Him in His kingdom. For eternity, He will be the centrality of the New Jerusalem. It is impossible to exhaust all that God is and all that He has done and will do in Christ. </p>

Many of us can testify that, before coming into the Lord’s recovery, we did not know Christ adequately as the embodiment of God. However, after we came into the church life, we began to realize that our Christ is the embodiment of all that God is. <span class="pg" data-page-id="662" id="662">[662]</span> </p>

Eventually, we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89628" data-verses="Ephesians 3:19">v. 19</span>).

<p data-content-id="od6p5sc1GDqOFwWB01GI4UNtJvyA7TvvTOTFDcnJar4LT8Qnqe8UcaKDTX05Qn6K7"> The church is not simply a group of people who have been saved out of hell, who are waiting to go to heaven, and who beg the Lord to give them peace, joy, and a good life. The church in the Lord’s recovery does not beg God for things. Rather, we in the local churches praise the Lord for all He is to us. Praise Him that the church has the embodiment of God as her content! How we thank the Lord for revealing this to us! </p>

If we would see these five aspects clearly, we need to ask the Lord to blow away all the clouds that for centuries have kept Christians from seeing Christ in a full way. In previous messages we have pointed out that Christ is unlimited, immeasurable, and unsearchable. He is the all-inclusive One that fills all in all (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89629" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">1:23</span>). He is even the very dimensions of the universe: the breadth, and length, and height, and depth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89630" data-verses="Ephesians 3:18">3:18</span>).

Through this washing He will present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing. The church Christ will present to Himself will be holy and without blemish. </p>
<p data-content-id="_gz5R_nH5oLy8-la4zwars71eBAIdijurKKMBUDGJR9KRsTuy0qXMYueEupKE4DZW"> Christ’s purpose in giving Himself up for the church was to sanctify her. He will not only separate the church to Himself from everything common, but will also saturate her with Himself so that she may be His counterpart. This is accomplished by the washing of water in the Word. How Christ loves the church! The Christ who dwells within us is the Christ who loves the church. Having given Himself up for the church and to the church, He is now sanctifying her. In His love for the church, He is cleansing and purifying her to make her holy and without blemish. </p>

Spots come from wounds, and wrinkles come from oldness. Through Christ’s sanctifying work, the church will eventually be without spot or wrinkle. She will be holy and without blemish. To be holy is to be saturated and transformed with Christ, and to be without blemish is to be spotless and without wrinkle. One day the church will be fully transformed. Only Christ can bring the church to such a condition. The Christ who is the embodiment of God is the Christ who loves the church and is cleansing her by the washing of the water in the Word. </p>

According to them, we cannot have the church life in this age; they say the church life is possible only in the age to come. Those who hold this view say that we should not talk about the church, but simply love the Lord, preach the gospel, and help the believers to be spiritual. Many of those who take such a position are opposed to the Lord’s present recovery. But in spite of all opposition, we have the assurance that the church life will be recovered in full in this age, not in the age to come. </p>
<p data-content-id="dvx25G8sssSYMALmWN9v-wwbK3yMrwN7G3_YIZuDLoUsHACVRNy6oYa6xgCQFEpxU"> It is contrary to the Scriptures to say that the church life will be in the coming age. The next age will not be the age of the church; it will be the age of the kingdom. In this present age, before His coming back, the Lord must have the church life to shame the enemy. I believe that for centuries Satan, the enemy of God, has been challenging Christ concerning the church. Perhaps Satan has said to Him, “Where is Your church? Show me the church You have promised to build. Some of Your servants even teach that it is not possible to have the church life in this age.” Perhaps Christ is saying to Satan, “Satan, look at the local churches on earth today. Consider how many of My people are testifying that it is possible to have the church life in this age. They are not only for the church life, but are in the church life in a practical way.” </p>

The various functions of our personality—our mind, emotion, and will—are directly related to our heart, not to our spirit. Because all the functions of personality are concentrated in the heart, it is the place where Christ desires to make His home. Christ as the life-giving Spirit is now in our spirit. However, He wants to spread into our hearts and make His home there. </p>
<p data-content-id="e7TeZuy6ip5trkTcKOr38fr14Dbfqup2tVAiVqlMGn0mLpxnTuxCJvbcyNlyALCaC"> Through regeneration we have Christ as the Spirit in our spirit. But through transformation Christ will spread from our spirit into our heart. Every regenerated person has Christ in his spirit, but not many have allowed Christ to spread into their hearts. This is the reason Paul prayed that we would be strengthened into our inner man so that Christ may make His home in our hearts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89648" data-verses="Ephesians 3:16">3:16</span>). It seems as if Paul <span class="pg" data-page-id="670" id="670">[670]</span> wanted to tell the Ephesians, “Because you have been saved and regenerated, you have Christ in your spirit. But I’m concerned that you have not allowed Christ to spread into your hearts. Therefore, I pray for you that you may be strengthened in your spirit by the Spirit so that Christ may make His home in your hearts.” </p>
<p data-content-id="5tbeNC7n4bELsmeplIXgNzTGjgwDSKoF26Q5SKhmn5Z95j36NkbT_ysCBWMthTXfH"> We need to take Christ not only as the life in our spirit, but also as the person in our heart. When Christ is in our spirit, He is our life. However, when He spreads into our heart, He also becomes our person. We all have Christ in our spirit, but I wonder how much Christ has spread into our heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bD_qOVJS0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D"> Sisters, do you take Christ as your person when you go shopping? Do you allow Him to make home in your heart as you are deciding what to buy? For the most part, you are the one who makes these decisions, not Christ. You have Christ in your spirit as life. The problem is that you confine Him to your spirit. Deep within I am afraid that you say, “Lord Jesus, You are my life in my spirit. But when it comes to shopping, I want You to stay in my spirit. Let me shop according to what is in my heart. I want to buy the things I like. Lord, my spirit is Your sphere. But my heart is reserved for me.” When you pray, you may contact the Lord in your spirit, only to leave Him and go shopping according to your own desire and choice. Of course, the sisters may not put this into words, but this may be their attitude. I doubt that many sisters consult the Lord about their shopping. This indicates that in the practical matter of shopping they do not take Christ as their person in their hearts. </p>
<p data-content-id="jzy56D5a4K14njv2OL9QfpnM73HnJ1Ab9R3e21WSu1YH0DQn4sk-OuELvP5dRJ2jv"> Simply having Christ as life does not produce the church life. In order to have the proper church life, we must take Christ as our person. Remember that the church is the new man as well as the Body. As the new man, the church needs Christ as the person. The main problem is not with the life, but with the person. There is no need to adjust the life, but there is the need for a change of person. Our mind, emotion, and will all need to be adjusted. With the church life, the problem is not only with our taking Christ as life; it is also <span class="pg" data-page-id="671" id="671">[671]</span> with our taking Christ as our person. Very few saints take Christ as their person in an adequate way. To have Christ as our person is deeper, higher, and fuller than to have Him as our life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89649" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span> Paul did not pray that the saints would have Christ as life. He prayed that they would take Him as their person by allowing Him to make His home in their hearts. This is our need today. </p>
<p data-content-id="TS0vLm3wTVrzuTUulNHSpsNq2UDS2c-25mTg4xYz74KQnIYS77RmuCw_eSmkzr8AS"> Whatever we do, we should do by taking Christ as our person. The question is not what we do, but who is doing it. Are we the ones, or is it Christ? Concerning shopping, it is not a matter of what we intend to buy; it is a matter of who is buying that particular item. Are we the ones buying it, or is it Christ? If we do not take Christ as our person, it may even be wrong in the eyes of the Lord to purchase a Bible. Hence, the question is not what we do or what we buy; it is who is doing that thing or buying that item. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nFupmXdU7v_F8Wz3VyT4gw6NPecWDqgfhZHMQs6SxdJFG3VrWN2G3kyhCMk9WVErP">CHRIST EXPRESSED IN THE CHURCH</h2><p data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR0MYBZ2CWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB"> The only way for Christ to be our person is for Him to make His home in our hearts. The need in all the local churches is for the saints to take Christ both as their life and as their person by allowing Him to make His home in their hearts. The churches are the Lord’s testimony on earth. But this testimony must have an inward reality. I am sorry to say that it is possible for the church to be an empty shell, a shell without content. The content of the church must be the very Christ whom we take as life and as our person. If we take Christ as our person, then as we come together in the meetings Christ will be expressed from our spirit and through our heart. All those who come will sense that Christ is present both as our life and as our person. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4-zWofFDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> The meetings of a local church must be the expression of Christ. Christ is not only the victorious and prevailing life, but also a practical, present, living Person. Whenever we testify in the meetings, others will be able to tell whether or not we have been taking Christ as our person. If we are faithful to take Christ as our person, we shall enjoy the presence of the Lord Jesus in the meetings. In fact, the meetings <span class="pg" data-page-id="672" id="672">[672]</span> will even be His presence, for He will be expressed from within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAzOtTlZhH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9"> We need to pray for ourselves and for others to have the reality of taking Christ as our person in our daily living. Everything we do should be done not by the self, but by Christ. His tastes and preferences need to become ours. Then Christ will be not only our life, but also our person. The Lord will thus expand in our heart, take possession of our heart, and make His home in our heart in a full way. Eventually, He will saturate our whole being with Himself, and we shall live no longer by the self, but by Christ. The more this becomes our experience, the more the meetings of the church will be the presence of the Lord Jesus. In such meetings there is little need for preaching, teaching, or the exercise of gifts, because Christ is expressed through the saints. Because Christ is so rich, available, present, and practical in the experience of the saints, they will be able to share Christ with one another. What a difference between such meetings and the “services” in today’s Christianity! </p>

It is not the expression of such things as doctrine, gifts, or power. Nevertheless, subconsciously or unconsciously, many think that the church should be characterized by the manifestation of spiritual gifts. Some believe that whenever Christians meet together there should be the exercise and demonstration of the so-called charismatic gifts of the Holy Spirit. However, the book of Ephesians, a book on the church, does not mention this kind of gift. There is not a word in this Epistle about speaking in tongues or healing. When Paul speaks of gifts in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89664" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">Ephesians 4</span>, he is referring to persons who are made gifts to the Body. For example, the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are gifts. As we have pointed out elsewhere, every member of the Body is a gift to the church. Hence, in Ephesians a gift is not what we have or what we do; it is what we are. To be such a gift is to be constituted with Christ as life. This causes our very being to become a gift to the Body. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="inTRR5aqA6f3Zp0g5VCt5vCclxBxYPP9fz0SGMS6TD8Ev1RYK0XGG-yq2bZI5h3Uz">INDIVIDUALISM AND DIVISIVENESS</h2><p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQAZI9Wmddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> We thank the Lord for the many Christians who have been helped through the experience of charismatic gifts. However, we cannot agree with the claim that all Christians will become one if they have certain charismatic experiences. According to my experience and observation, those who emphasize the Pentecostal or charismatic experiences are the most divisive. The more certain believers exercise their spiritual gifts, the more individualistic and divisive they become. This is the reason that there have been so <span class="pg" data-page-id="678" id="678">[678]</span> many divisions among those who stress spiritual gifts. In Christian meetings they may not care much for the edification of others, but care primarily for the manifestation of their own gifts. Some excuse their individualism by saying that they take heed only to God, not to man, and claiming that everything they do is of the Spirit’s inspiration. </p>

The church is the fullness of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89666" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">3:8</span> Paul says that he preached the unsearchable riches of Christ. (Paul does not say here that he preached doctrine or gifts.) We need to know the difference between the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ. Most Christians confuse these terms, thinking that the riches of Christ are the same as the fullness of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="B77vULL4YXIHFFm6havIcY9BVVNWwoUVhHMvf-EO7Y7mN_8U3mz_Sb5pyhxZje63p"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89667" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">chapter three</span> Paul goes on to speak of Christ making His home in our heart, with the result that we are filled unto all the fullness of God. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89668" data-verses="Ephesians 4:13">4:13</span> he says that we need to arrive “at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89669" data-verses="Ephesians 5:18">5:18</span> he says that we should be filled in our spirit. Surely this is related to being filled unto all the fullness of God. Such a filling takes place in our spirit, not in the mind. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89670" data-verses="Ephesians 5:18">5:18</span> Paul is not saying that we are filled with the Holy Spirit; he is emphasizing the fact that we need to be filled in our spirit, even filled unto all the fullness of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="xOItbD1M_SnXcAkcMHRO0aDltC_nCBIPiZ8yi6s5e1DrTLjV78UWPV1TgR921-jvh"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89671" data-verses="Ephesians 5:18">5:18</span> Paul presents a contrast between being drunk with wine and being filled in spirit. To be drunk with wine is to be filled in the body, whereas to be filled in our regenerated spirit is to be filled with Christ unto all the fullness of God. To be drunk with wine in the body causes us to be dissipated, but to be filled with Christ, the fullness of God, causes us to overflow with Him in speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks to God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89672" data-verses="Ephesians 5:19-20">vv. 19-20</span>) and to subject ourselves one to another (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89673" data-verses="Ephesians 5:21">v. 21</span>). How important it is for us to be filled in spirit unto all the fullness of God! <span class="pg" data-page-id="679" id="679">[679]</span> </p>

The riches of Christ are what Christ is to us in all His divine attributes and human virtues. These riches are unsearchable. The fullness of Christ, the Body, issues from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. Through the enjoyment of Christ’s riches, we become His fullness to express Him. Christ, who is the infinite God without limitation of any kind, is so great that He fills all things in all things. Such a Christ needs the church to be His fullness for His complete expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9rpVFU7TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> We have pointed out that the riches of Christ are unsearchable. Included in these riches is Christ’s divinity. He is the very God. Since Christ is the Son of God, another aspect of His riches is sonship. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89674" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>, the Son is even called the eternal Father. This indicates that He has not only the sonship, but also the fatherhood. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89675" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">Second Corinthians 3:17</span> says that Christ the Lord is the Spirit. This is another item of Christ’s unsearchable riches. Other items include Christ as light, life, love, righteousness, holiness, humility, patience, and submission. How long the list would be if anyone could enumerate all the aspects of the riches of Christ! </p>
<p data-content-id="KinSpiWncXMNo5T64K5GnF2DivJMOAmz0SWiBllAApDxAJJy3NRnyUU_zHhMXOBI9"> Christ’s riches need an expression. When these riches come forth to be expressed, that expression is the fullness of Christ. When Christ was incarnated, God’s riches were expressed. However, the incarnation by no means exhausted these riches. Rather, it was the overflow, the fullness, of the riches of God. Christ came forth from the bosom of the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89676" data-verses="John 1:18">John 1:18</span>). But His coming forth did not at all exhaust the divine riches in the Father’s bosom. On the contrary, the more that came forth, the more there was to come forth. Therefore, with Christ there were not only the riches, but also the fullness. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89677" data-verses="John 1:16">John 1:16</span> says, “For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.” Christ is the fullness of the Godhead. When He came to earth, He was the overflow of the riches of God. Hence, He became the <span class="pg" data-page-id="680" id="680">[680]</span> fullness of God. Not only were the riches within Him, but the very fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him bodily (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89678" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="lwsB7fTo0YBNqEyc92s8YZt5buR5l2669bSShh3cXlYnPCMXGJH6EofNa-wN0fGTI"> Christ is the fullness of God, and the church is the fullness of Christ. Christ’s riches are so extensive that not only is Christ Himself filled with them, but these riches also fill up the members of His Body, the church. As we are filled with Christ’s riches, we become His fullness. In this way the church becomes the fullness of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ORuveXsLSL_KAUQRmmsRwUAPnxfJksZhadewDeZFVr0RNBcjRKpEUgJ7ZofkxfD26">THE UNLIMITED EXPRESSION<br/>OF THE UNLIMITED CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="4hu3V9NSxOD4qIDQx-aI8ny_OXQAdHAukquOkznsExY9T1eCWD6YHuZmIvOhld_9j"> The fullness of Christ comes out of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. For the church to have the riches of Christ and not the fullness of Christ would be an indication that Christ is limited. But the fact that the church not only has Christ’s riches but also is His fullness indicates that the Christ experienced and enjoyed by the church is unlimited. Limited riches cannot produce fullness. Only unlimited riches are capable of producing the fullness. As the expression of the unsearchably rich Christ, the church is the unlimited expression of the unlimited Christ. This means that the church is the fullness of Christ who is Himself the embodiment of the fullness of God. My burden in this message is simply to point out that the church must be such an expression of Christ. </p>

The church may seem to be a social <span class="pg" data-page-id="686" id="686">[686]</span> group composed of different kinds of people. Worldly people view the church in such a way, as just another social organization. We need to see the difference between the church and a social club. Social clubs may have high requirements for their members. They may insist on superior standards of dress, behavior, and character. Outwardly, the members of such clubs may be better than the saints in the churches. However, no matter how good a club may be, it is merely a human organization. In contrast to the church, it has nothing of Christ. But the church is the overflow, the surplus, of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZF7iQ7T0lQJP8gtIC7nMKHRSnLd4EgK5Boj8tqPtmmD8KvxV6FuuLU1d_HGholgwP"> The members of a club may be regulated outwardly according to certain requirements. Those who fulfill these requirements may have a very good appearance in the eyes of man. In certain respects, they may seem better than those in the churches. However, in the eyes of God the best of human standards and behavior is nothing but dung. In the church we do not need outward improvement or correction. On the contrary, we need Christ to swallow up all our shortcomings with Himself. If the members of the church are short in certain respects, this indicates that they need more of Christ. We must resist the temptation to change the church into a social club with standards and regulations. This has nothing to do with the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is constituted solely of Christ wrought into the saints. </p>

These things, however, are not the focal point of God’s eternal economy. God’s economy is not to have a good family life; it is to have a Body for Christ. If we are in the Body of Christ in a proper and practical way, we shall no doubt have a proper family life. However, we may have an outstanding family life and yet have nothing to do with the <span class="pg" data-page-id="687" id="687">[687]</span> Body of Christ. I have known unbelievers whose family life was better than that of many Christians. Although the family life of these unbelievers was good, it had nothing to do with Christ or with God’s economy. It is crucial for us to see that the focal point of God’s economy is not a standard of character or behavior; it is Christ with the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiEPvr6ji8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND"> In his subtlety, Satan, the enemy of God, has used such things as Bible knowledge, spiritual gifts, and evangelism to keep believers from seeing God’s economy. During the time of the Lord Jesus on the earth and of the Apostle Paul, Satan utilized the Old Testament to veil the Jewish people. When the Lord Jesus appeared to them as the very incarnation of God, they were not able to recognize Him. On the contrary, with the Scriptures in their hands, they sentenced the Lord Jesus to death. According to their concept, they were serving God in so doing. </p>
<p data-content-id="P5LAppNM9anuOY8qKFZGxcab2XKRBW6wXX1IPiDZBj9REBKOwCbu8774faHM2uakW"> Christians today should not regard themselves as superior to those Jewish religionists. It is entirely possible for Christians today to be deceived just as the Jews were. The enemy still uses the knowledge of the Bible to keep people from seeing Christ. Furthermore, he will use almost anything as a substitute for Christ and to keep people from seeing the revelation of God’s economy concerning Christ and the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-xjGehvejCQlzalTuo32KU27QU9jSuPgtsH4FEYaUB1lCP61PJ3xPUdWBlbNL_kSt">TRANSFORMED TO BECOME CHRIST’S OVERFLOW</h2><p data-content-id="pUgU6yw7JGTUYrgFoe8JTp36ZQJHav7TrTsP0dxOoJBaWmsdb5vA9y_VoOGAtYpSI"> We have pointed out that the church is the overflow of Christ. In order to be in reality the overflow of Christ, we need to be transformed. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89690" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">Second Corinthians 3:18</span> says that as we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face, we are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory. Yes, the saints still have their shortcomings and failures, but they are nonetheless undergoing the process of transformation. The more we are transformed, the more we become the overflow of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="vNGdZHHY14iAb_v6HwIE3H66MAnRVeE22cQi8F0_YUxRFUJ9ktsfg-XG_7irJOOpq"> It is easy to adjust people outwardly by asking them to conform to certain regulations. But it takes time for the divine life to grow within us. For example, in a very short <span class="pg" data-page-id="688" id="688">[688]</span> period of time you can make an artificial flower. But to produce a real flower, a flower that has life and fragrance, may take several months. If we regulate others outwardly, we shall only delay the process of the growth in life. Therefore, we should be patient and allow the Lord to grow in the saints. Eventually, the growth in life will produce the desired change. This is the difference between the church and a social club. </p>
<p data-content-id="WMnpS5Obzk_YTS3q3GOFH1SpuAwlOrnZYpJ1P_jLUOjwyCSv5ZbC6HMtrIdmASj5I"> As the Body of Christ, the church is a living organism constituted of the divine life. The divine life came into us at the time of regeneration, and now it is working within us to saturate every part of our being and to swallow up all our negative element. By this process the church becomes the Body in a practical way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2dq7QF0hlVfHljch6uMOWbrgz8vYrD7PM_en5LHupWopm5T9JM8tlnCWOoNUSQNy6">EXPERIENCING CHRIST FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="uRn6e8DCDhYvxWArZZyg1AAtRPaStbWQ-S4ajELiYI6nagGr9Sjsomhlk1pMnAffa"> In the recovery the Lord is not working mainly to recover teachings, gifts, or practices. On the contrary, the recovery is a matter of experiencing Christ as life for the church life. If some feel that the goal of the Lord’s recovery is the recovery of certain teachings and gifts, I would say that time will prove that this is a false expectation. More than ten years ago certain ones claimed that the Lord desires to recover the vast field of Pentecostal gifts. Those who made this claim were living in a dream, and they are no longer in the Lord’s recovery. At the time I told them that they were dreaming and that if they would not wake up from their dream, they would suffer loss. They would be deceived by their dream. Those who did not give up that dream have in fact suffered loss spiritually. Today many of them are apart from the Lord’s presence and grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4ag2tKx1VOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1"> The indwelling Christ can keep us safely in the way of the Lord. It is crucial that we all know the indwelling Christ and allow Him to make His home in our hearts. We should not desire to do a great work. Instead, we should be satisfied to allow Christ to live in us and for Him to use us to impart His element into others. If this is our situation, it is not we who work for the Lord, but Christ who does the work from <span class="pg" data-page-id="689" id="689">[689]</span> within us. If we experience Christ in this way, then in reality and in practicality the church will be the Body of Christ. The church as the Body comes out of Christ Himself, for it is His overflow, His surplus. </p>

This indicates that the very Christ who is making His home in us is the Christ with the unsearchable riches. The unsearchable riches of Christ are for our enjoyment. Day by day and even hour by hour we need to enjoy these marvelous, wonderful, immeasurable, unlimited, and all-inclusive riches. </p>
<p data-content-id="WMnpS5Obzk_YTS3q3GOFH1SpvAw0ErnZYpJ1P_jLUOjwyCSv5ZbC6HMtrIdmASj5I"> It is difficult to list all the items of the riches of Christ. If these items were few in number, it would be easy for us to point them out. But Christ’s riches are beyond our ability to speak of them or to enumerate them. In order to get into the riches of Christ in Ephesians, it will be helpful to consider Paul’s experience of these riches as revealed in the book of 2 Corinthians. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2dq7QF0hlVfHljch6uMOWbrgy8vNgD7PM_en5LHupWopm5T9JM8tlnCWOoNUSQNy6">GIFTS, GRACE, AND TRANSFORMATION</h2><p data-content-id="uRn6e8DCDhYvxWArZZyg1AAtQPa7lbWQ-S4ajELiYI6nagGr9Sjsomhlk1pMnAffa"> The book of 2 Corinthians deals with grace, in contrast to 1 Corinthians, which deals with gifts. Paul concludes 2 Corinthians with the words, “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89708" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">13:14</span>, Gk.). Because 2 Corinthians is a book of grace, in the concluding verse Paul mentions grace first. Grace is deeper and more subjective than gifts. Gifts are outward, but grace is inward. Furthermore, gifts are related to what we do, but grace is related to inward enjoyment. <span class="pg" data-page-id="694" id="694">[694]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4ag2sKxYcOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1"> It is significant that it is in 2 Corinthians, not in 1 Corinthians, that Paul says that we are transformed as we behold the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89709" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Cor. 3:18</span>). To be gifted is one thing, but to be transformed is another. Although many Christians pay attention to gifts, not many concentrate on transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="4hu3V9NSxOD4qIDQx-aI8ny_MXQAVHAukquOkznsExY9T1eCWD6YHuZmIvOhld_9j"> Do you prefer to be gifted or to be transformed? Before you answer this question, consider the example of Balaam’s donkey (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89710" data-verses="Numbers 22:23-33">Num. 22:23-33</span>). Suddenly this donkey spoke to Balaam. How miraculous for a donkey to speak a human language! However, the donkey was not transformed into a human being. There was the gift of speaking, but there was not any transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="od6p5sc1GDqOFwWB01GI4UNRDvyhwTvvTOTFDcnJar4LT8Qnqe8UcaKDTX05Qn6K7"> Transformation takes place slowly through the growth in life. It transpires so slowly that it may seem as if nothing is happening. For example, to a mother, her young child may look the same every day. Actually, the child is gradually growing. </p>
<p data-content-id="3GEuFAt2o9byg8MZDzK996mz_fH3HXg_LkbTuP-LW2tuU3xrWTByUo7lMUOiCI2ZU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89711" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:7">2 Corinthians 4:7</span> Paul says, “But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.” The treasure in the earthen vessels does not refer to gifts. Rather, it denotes something precious that is hidden. The vessel is outward, but the treasure is inward. Through the process of transformation over a period of time, the treasure takes over the vessel and swallows it up. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GJHsP88GHseo8rpjYyem_lGrRqQ164KrNMLYo1DtwblC8XXjSuatQl8WDTK_MeK3O">THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="cUZm3R2OO3-xg87ohmxD-0ktbbXb4m8pa3KWJwuNiJOAyh8b5NcNgFoM_6ZG01679"> Another difference between 2 Corinthians and 1 Corinthians is that 2 Corinthians speaks a great deal about suffering, but there is no need for suffering in order to have spiritual gifts. It was not necessary for Balaam’s donkey to suffer to have the ability to speak a human language. Transformation, on the contrary, requires a certain amount of suffering. For this reason, 2 Corinthians speaks not only of the grace of Christ, but also of the sufferings of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89712" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:5">2 Corinthians 1:5</span> Paul says that “the sufferings of Christ abound in us.” The grace of Christ with the sufferings of <span class="pg" data-page-id="695" id="695">[695]</span> Christ produces transformation. Transformation is not a matter of our gifts or abilities; it is a matter of what we are in our inward being. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y7KPbnfhmVACkNVkC3njcSpd5kiFHRrpc5RUdAorxwk76X6_8r4-6ikKrq_X9AheN"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89713" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:5">2 Corinthians 4:5</span> Paul declared, “For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord.” Although Paul did not preach himself or write an autobiography, occasionally he found it necessary to disclose certain aspects of his experience of Christ. In 2 Corinthians there are a number of such disclosures by which we can see how Paul enjoyed particular aspects of the riches of Christ. Later on in this message we shall consider these particular aspects. </p>
<p data-content-id="EkaMV3Soowz1Y1LdwSAggrag7cxwo6M0H0MN5WrZ4ZYcDUwX2c921mm7c4iIL8IZY"> Certain aspects of the riches of Christ are very great. Some of these are the fact that Christ is God, the Creator, the Son of God, the Redeemer, the Savior, the Father, and the life-giving Spirit. Other major aspects are related to incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, descension, and indwelling. Furthermore, there are the aspects of Christ as life, love, power, holiness, and righteousness. All these are great items, and, to some degree at least, Christians do know them. However, Christians may have just a doctrinal knowledge of these riches of Christ without the experience of them. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may not only know the various aspects of the riches of Christ, but also experience them and enjoy them. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="D20V42Q_F8EMHQVYOrygvO7lx2B2o4EAp5I6xaxu5BS3a8z8gUxLYQQk1sl7LSiAO">CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="S26jTFFVZnj955_hMlMnIhYMzMx0tdPkCD61VuHGKt4L3wCMJyIZ3UBt_LzbPLTVG"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89714" data-verses="Romans 10:12">Romans 10:12</span> gives us a clue as to how we may enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ. In this verse Paul says, “The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.” The riches of Christ should not just be studied—they should be enjoyed. We do not enjoy them by meditating upon them. To meditate is to exercise the mind. In the New Testament we are not told to meditate. (The use of the word meditate by the King James Version in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89715" data-verses="1Timothy 4:15">1 Timothy 4:15</span> is not an accurate translation; the Greek word is better rendered “attend to.”) If we desire to experience the riches of Christ, we should call on the name of the Lord Jesus. Many of us can testify that such calling is much sweeter and more enjoyable than <span class="pg" data-page-id="696" id="696">[696]</span> meditating. The more we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the more we taste His sweetness. </p>
<p data-content-id="gBi8-OiEa7te_n7JZc2wVW6YnMFHyZhCfpqqsc2x3FtvD6W9167GIkeZns_JUH8SK"> Some criticize our practice of calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. According to them, it is merely a psychological phenomenon with no spiritual value. If calling on the Lord’s name simply produces a temporary psychological experience, then the same experience could be achieved by calling on the name of some other person. However, such is not the case. When we call on the dear name of the Lord Jesus, we enjoy His reality and taste His sweetness. Remember, the Lord’s name is backed up by His Person. Thus, when we call on the name, we contact the Person, the reality of whom is the Spirit. For this reason, when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="e7TeZuy6ip5trkTcKOr38fr17Db2gup2tVAiVqlMGn0mLpxnTuxCJvbcyNlyALCaC"> The name of the Lord Jesus is often associated with the Spirit in the Bible. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89716" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:11">1 Corinthians 6:11</span> says, “But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.” Jesus is the name, and the Spirit is the Person. Whenever we call on the name of Jesus, we experience the Person of the Spirit. Because this Person is real, living, near, and available, we experience Him and enjoy Him when we call on Him. The Lord Jesus is rich to all who call upon Him. What a wonderful way to enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5tbeNC7n4bELsmeplIXgNzTGggwuZKoF26Q5SKhmn5Z95j36NkbT_ysCBWMthTXfH">LIVING IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyFT30i5fOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi"> The book of 2 Corinthians reveals the kind of life lived by the Apostle Paul. Paul lived by taking Christ as his life and person. He was constantly enjoying Christ and experiencing Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89717" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:10">2 Corinthians 2:10</span> he says that he forgave “in the person of Christ.” Paul did not forgive in himself, that is, in his own person. When he forgave something, he forgave it in the person of Christ. This reveals that Paul lived in the person of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyTbOtHYSr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> Everything we do should be done in the person of Christ. This means that when a brother loves his wife, he should love her in the person of Christ. Moreover, when a sister goes <span class="pg" data-page-id="697" id="697">[697]</span> shopping, she should shop in the person of Christ. As long as we do a particular thing in the person of Christ, there is no problem. </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8r2CawAQiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> It is rather difficult to render accurately the Greek word for person in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89718" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:10">2 Corinthians 2:10</span>. It may be rendered face or presence. The Greek signifies the area of the face around the eyes. This part of a person’s face is the index of his feeling and inward being. By looking at this part of a person’s face, we know how he feels about a certain thing. When Paul said that he forgave in the person of Christ, he was saying that he forgave in the index of the Lord’s inward being. </p>

If we are filled in spirit, that with which we are filled will overflow from within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="a-sefdyyFRnPSiT6ZZ18VpqFjG9UaTLq-KbZep_8kFXpjCLum-lwALY397Cqj_hpR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89736" data-verses="Ephesians 5:19">Verse 19</span> refers to this overflow: “Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.” We do not overflow by meditating or by sitting silently in the meetings of the church. On the contrary, we overflow by speaking to one another. If we are filled in spirit unto all the fullness of God, we shall spontaneously speak to one another concerning Christ. Speaking, therefore, is the way to overflow. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89737" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:2">1 Corinthians 12:2</span> Paul mentions “dumb idols.” Because idols cannot speak, those who worship idols are also dumb. A dumb god needs dumb worshippers. If you visit a country where there is the practice of idol worship, you can see that idol worshippers worship their gods in a dumb way. But our God is not dumb; He is the speaking God. Therefore, those who worship Him must also speak. However, many who attend the so-called services in Christianity do not speak. Instead, they worship the Lord in a dumb way. What is our situation in the meetings of the church? Are we silent, or are we bubbling over with words about the Christ we have experienced in our daily life? In the meetings we should <span class="pg" data-page-id="704" id="704">[704]</span> praise the Lord and speak of what He is to us in our experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="yso9Pxvovo30rgMfTrxdwDtoTBN4pZ3STh7ddBjVVV-UFyNUyESGMFZxFx7YtQwo0"> Many Christians realize that their religious services should not be altogether silent. Therefore, they arrange to have soloists, quartets, and choirs to provide music. They also may hire outstanding preachers to speak. Nevertheless, most of the people sit silently in the pews, and, for the most part, are dumb worshippers. </p>
<p data-content-id="pUgU6yw7JGTUYrgFoe8JTp36fQJHSv7TrTsP0dxOoJBaWmsdb5vA9y_VoOGAtYpSI"> The very architecture of many places of Christian worship is conducive to silence. For example, many spontaneously become quiet when they enter Catholic cathedrals. The steep roof, the dimly-lighted atmosphere, and the stained glass windows all encourage dumbness. Some worshippers may burn candles before images or pray in front of statues. How devilish! In principle, this is the same as the idol worship practiced in pagan countries. Much of Christianity has been permeated by the concept of silent worship. In effect, many who attend the Christian services are dumb worshippers. </p>
<p data-content-id="vNGdZHHY14iAb_v6HwIE3H66KAnRdeE22cQi8F0_YUxRFUJ9ktsfg-XG_7irJOOpq"> Since our God is a speaking God, we as His worshippers must also speak.

In a number of other verses we are told to do the same thing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89739" data-verses="Psalms 66:1">Psa. 66:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89740" data-verses="Psalms 81:1">81:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89741" data-verses="Psalms 95:2">95:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89742" data-verses="Psalms 98:4">98:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89743" data-verses="Psalms 98:6">6</span>).

<p data-content-id="WMnpS5Obzk_YTS3q3GOFH1SpoAwpMrnZYpJ1P_jLUOjwyCSv5ZbC6HMtrIdmASj5I"> As we speak to one another of our experiences of Christ, we should not wait for some kind of formal beginning of the meetings. To do this is to remain under the influence of traditional Christianity. If we have been set free from tradition, we shall speak spontaneously as we come together in the meetings of the church. Some may even begin to speak on the way to the meeting. The meetings need to be filled with speaking concerning the riches of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="2dq7QF0hlVfHljch6uMOWbrg18vUpD7PM_en5LHupWopm5T9JM8tlnCWOoNUSQNy6"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89744" data-verses="Ephesians 5:19">Ephesians 5:19</span> also refers to “singing and psalming” to the Lord. Such singing and psalming are not only the overflow of being filled in spirit, but also the way to be filled in spirit. Whenever we are filled in our spirit unto all the <span class="pg" data-page-id="705" id="705">[705]</span> fullness of God, the first thing we shall do is speak. Then we shall sing and psalm with our heart to the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="uRn6e8DCDhYvxWArZZyg1AAtXPaerbWQ-S4ajELiYI6nagGr9Sjsomhlk1pMnAffa"> Many pride themselves on being scriptural. I wonder, however, if they are scriptural according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89745" data-verses="Ephesians 5:19">5:19</span>. This verse, found in a book that deals with the church, tells us that after we have been filled in our spirit unto all the fullness of God, we need to speak. Many who regard themselves as scriptural are scriptural only in a traditional way. They are not scriptural according to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89746" data-verses="Ephesians 5:19">verse 19</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4ag2rKx5TOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1">THE BIBLICAL UNDERSTANDING OF PROPHECY</h2><p data-content-id="IYKcWTBZD2wraBqVv8VOsOtvZdnZEu5Z92lk4lPzJmdAd2biN-nCndK5RLnSYtepK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89747" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">1 Corinthians 14:1</span> Paul says, “Pursue love, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy” (Gk.). Most people regard prophecy merely as a foretelling of future events. According to this understanding, someone predicts the future and concludes his speaking with the words, “Thus saith the Lord.” For example, in 1963 some prophesied that a great earthquake would cause Los Angeles to fall into the ocean. Prediction, however, is not the primary meaning of prophecy in the Bible, especially in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="HfUkPNVdvPc-TGtNi_PIz-vQ21zqQ3n27HnTj40Roiaxg_VGkAzUncYLNZiT2Ke0a"> In the Bible to prophesy has three meanings. First, it is to speak for someone, to speak on behalf of another person. When one prophesies in this way, he speaks not for himself, but for someone else. Hence, someone may be called upon to prophesy for the Lord, that is, to speak on the Lord’s behalf. Second, to prophesy means to speak forth, to declare. In the Bible a person may not only speak for God, but he may also speak forth something of God. Third, to prophesy is to foretell, to predict. Therefore, the three meanings of prophesy are to speak for, to tell forth, and to foretell. However, the meaning of foretell is not the primary meaning. </p>
<p data-content-id="XN29daXoEaiDc-NwR9H8WYCbNCQLaqlHCNZd9RwShWBkL98XRz-1aU8fWCfEcI9un"> Let us use the book of Isaiah as an example. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89748" data-verses="Isaiah 1:3">Isaiah 1:3</span> says, “The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.” What kind of prophecy is this? Certainly it is not foretelling. Rather, it is a declaration, a speaking forth something that is of the Lord. The same is true of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89749" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government <span class="pg" data-page-id="706" id="706">[706]</span> shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” This word is a declaration, a telling forth. It is not primarily a foretelling of a future event. Of course, in the book of Isaiah there are a number of instances of such foretellings or predictions. Nevertheless, most of the book of Isaiah is either a speaking for or a telling forth. Only a relatively small portion of the book consists of foretelling. Thus, the content of the book of Isaiah illustrates the fact that the primary meaning of prophecy is not prediction, but declaration and speaking on behalf of another, especially on behalf of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="kW37bRWd4n3ChsU9j6t193ombSZGaNT7Km646Yo-l1oZoLWUehit8wxR0xamoxSLO"> As we preach the gospel, we may prophesy in this way. We may say to a group of unbelievers, “Friends, you must believe in the Lord Jesus. Otherwise, you will be eternally lost.” To speak in this manner is to prophesy in the sense of uttering something of the Lord and on behalf of the Lord. To preach the gospel, therefore, is to declare something of the Lord and to speak on behalf of the Lord. Such preaching may contain an element of prediction—for example, the prediction of eternal loss for those who refuse to believe in Christ—but such prediction is not the main element. In a general way, we can say that whenever we speak regarding the Lord or for the Lord, we are prophesying. How different this is from the common and traditional understanding of prophecy! </p>
<p data-content-id="Jf0PJ3Yzh-Zban-Z3PEii4PrmX0Kz6DqyCleWzpwECAyBCCrwndk4EBUpamTJ1Vjs"> If we intend to be scriptural in a comprehensive way, we need to accept the biblical understanding of prophecy. To prophesy is not to gossip or to speak for ourselves. Furthermore, it is not to speak forth something of ourselves. On the contrary, to prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth something of the Lord. As we have pointed out, such speaking may have the aspect of prediction. One who speaks for the Lord may say, “The Lord Jesus is faithful, available, near, and dear. Whenever we call on Him, He immediately comes, and we have the deep sense of His sweetness. But if we do not practice calling on the name of the Lord, our daily living will be pitiful.” To speak in this way is to prophesy. <span class="pg" data-page-id="707" id="707">[707]</span> </p>

This book also exposes certain negative things that damage the church life. According to our natural concept, we may expect Ephesians to emphasize such negative things as sin and worldliness. Although these are dealt with, they are not the main factors revealed in Ephesians as causes of damage to the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="rzBtTvnnp8EWQ9SXyt4WJFpiJK0tQN18pC-iFM-wWF7biwez5fLvQHeKFo4_b1dI7"> We all easily recognize that sin is damaging. Without even reading the Bible, we have the knowledge that sin is a cause of corruption. Therefore, when we read about sin in the Scriptures, we readily understand, for the concept of sin is already in our natural mentality. However, it is contrary to our natural concept to say that ordinances are more damaging to the church life than sin is. The verses which speak of ordinances may make little impression on us because they do not correspond to anything already in our natural concept. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dvx25G8sssSYMALmWN9v-wwnG3yZgwN7G3_YIZuDLoUsHACVRNy6oYa6xgCQFEpxU">FOUR CATEGORIES OF NEGATIVE THINGS</h2><p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9rtVFx1TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> What are the basic factors that damage the church life according to the revelation in the book of Ephesians? We have indicated that sin and worldliness, although certainly causes of damage, are not the basic negative factors in this book. In Ephesians there are four categories of negative things that damage the church life. The first of these is the ordinances. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89759" data-verses="Ephesians 2:14-15">2:14 and 15</span> Paul says that Christ “has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in <span class="pg" data-page-id="712" id="712">[712]</span> ordinances.” The law of commandments contained in ordinances is a cause of enmity. With the ordinances there are regulations, and these regulations are the law of commandments. This gives rise to enmity. Today there is enmity even among good, spiritual Christians, enmity caused by ordinances regarding certain practices. For instance, there may be enmity between those who practice baptism by immersion and those who practice baptism by sprinkling. Related to these practices there are ordinances with their law of commandments. These ordinances are the first basic category of negative things that damage the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="KinSpiWncXMNo5T64K5GnF2DmvJtBAmz0SWiBllAApDxAJJy3NRnyUU_zHhMXOBI9"> The second category is doctrine. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89760" data-verses="Ephesians 4:14">4:14</span> Paul says that we should “be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching.” The word teaching here refers to doctrine. Although Christians may regard doctrine as a positive thing, this verse clearly indicates that it can be used to carry us away from Christ. Any doctrine, even a scriptural one, that distracts the believers from Christ is a wind of teaching that carries them away from God’s economy. Doctrine, therefore, can be used to destroy the Body life. If we intend to have the proper church life, we must recognize the damage doctrine has caused to the Body of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="S26jTFFVZnj955_hMlMnIhYM1Mx0ldPkCD61VuHGKt4L3wCMJyIZ3UBt_LzbPLTVG"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89761" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span> Paul goes on to speak of the old man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89762" data-verses="Ephesians 4:22">v. 22</span>), the third category of negative things that damage the church. The old man is of Adam, created by God, but fallen through sin. Because the old man causes so much damage to the church life, we must put off the old man in order to have the proper practice of the Body life. </p>
<p data-content-id="gBi8-OiEa7te_n7JZc2wVW6YhMFH6ZhCfpqqsc2x3FtvD6W9167GIkeZns_JUH8SK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89763" data-verses="Ephesians 5:27">5:27</span> we see the fourth negative category: the spots and wrinkles. Spots are related to the natural life, and the wrinkles are related to oldness. Both spots and wrinkles are capable of causing serious damage to the church life in a very subjective way. The glorious church that Christ will present to Himself will not have spot or wrinkle or any such things, but will be holy and without blemish. </p>
<p data-content-id="e7TeZuy6ip5trkTcKOr38fr19Db6iup2tVAiVqlMGn0mLpxnTuxCJvbcyNlyALCaC"> Perhaps you have read the book of Ephesians a number of times without realizing that these four categories of <span class="pg" data-page-id="713" id="713">[713]</span> things can cause great damage to the church life. You may have read this book without paying attention to the matters of ordinances, doctrines, the old man, and spots and wrinkles. I myself read Ephesians for years before I began to see the seriousness of these four things with respect to the church life. In this message we shall deal in particular with the ordinances. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5tbeNC7n4bELsmeplIXgNzTGmgwibKoF26Q5SKhmn5Z95j36NkbT_ysCBWMthTXfH">BABEL, ORDINANCES, AND DIVISION</h2><p data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyFTx0i1ZOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi"> The primary source of the divisions among Christians throughout the centuries has been ordinances. We may trace these ordinances all the way back to the time of Babel. God’s intention in His creation of man was for mankind to be one. This was the reason that He created just one man, not a multitude of men. God’s desire was to have one corporate man. However, as a result of Babel, mankind was divided into nations, into a number of different peoples. Between these nations, these peoples, there are many differences. Not only are there differences in a general way between the Jews and the Gentiles, but there are also differences among the various nationalities, for example, between the Chinese and the Japanese, and between the Germans and the French. These differences have created divisions, and divisions are related to ordinances. </p>
<p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyTbItHUUr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> From the time of Babel, mankind has been divided by ordinances concerning the ways of living and worship. The source of this dividing work is the subtlety of the enemy, Satan. Through ordinances Satan has spoiled the oneness of the humanity created by God for the fulfillment of His purpose. Humanly speaking, it is not possible for the oneness of divided mankind to be restored. Although there is such an international organization as the United Nations, it is a fact that the nations are far from united. On the contrary, they are divided by ordinances. </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8r2EawMSiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> One of the main elements of ordinances is language. As we all know, the division of the peoples at Babel was related to differences of language. Hence, a primary element of ordinances is language. If we can overcome the difficulty <span class="pg" data-page-id="714" id="714">[714]</span> presented by language, a great part of our problem with ordinances will be solved. </p>
<p data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxia3sjnbAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy"> On the day of Pentecost God Himself did something very significant concerning language. Peoples of different languages were saved and brought into oneness. On that day the divisions caused by language were overcome, and the church as the one new man came into existence. For the church to be the new man means that the church is a new mankind, a new humanity, a new human race. The old humanity God had created for Himself had become divided by ordinances. But on the day of Pentecost the church came into being as the new man, the new humanity. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MiS0T4a3KCiS0HGposEC8jS0qqKJIv0mQ1p8RXf91j3qhYPyaQ4vSp2OaxeR_yzEI">THE MAIN CAUSE OF DIVISION</h2><p data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fB9QNPMfEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z"> However, throughout the centuries ordinances have crept in to divide Christians. Especially from the time of the Reformation Christians have been divided by ordinances concerning practices. Some Christians have made baptism by immersion an ordinance. With this ordinance as their basis, they have formed the Baptist denomination. Others have done the same thing with respect to their belief about presbytery or eldership. With an ordinance related to eldership as their basis, they have formed the Presbyterian denomination. This kind of thing has occurred again and again. The main reason Christians are divided is the ordinances concerning different religious practices. </p>
<p data-content-id="inTRR5aqA6f3Zp0g5VCt5vCchxBgSPP9fz0SGMS6TD8Ev1RYK0XGG-yq2bZI5h3Uz"> It is possible to have an ordinance about any practice. For example, we may have an ordinance about pray-reading. Although we find pray-reading helpful, we should not make an ordinance concerning it or insist that others practice it. Either to impose pray-reading on others or to oppose the practice of pray-reading is wrong. No matter how much life supply you receive through pray-reading, do not make an ordinance about pray-reading. Furthermore, do not allow your local church to become a pray-reading church. In other words, do not insist that all who attend the meetings practice pray-reading. To insist on pray-reading in this way is to be divisive. <span class="pg" data-page-id="715" id="715">[715]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQAdI9Dtddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_"> It is the tendency of Christians to create ordinances related to those practices which they personally find helpful. For this reason, there are ordinances about practices such as foot-washing and about speaking in tongues. Those who advocate speaking in tongues may have an ordinance imposing it, but those who oppose speaking in tongues may have an ordinance forbidding it. It is by ordinances like these that Christians have been divided. Therefore, it is of vital importance that we receive all genuine Christians and not become divided over ordinances. </p>

For example, we readily understand those verses that tell us we are sinful, that we are sinners under God’s condemnation, and that we are in need of God’s forgiveness. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89766" data-verses="Ephesians 2:11-22">2:11-22</span> there are a number of matters which do not fit in with our natural concept. For this reason, they are not adequately understood by most Christians when they read Ephesians. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="cUZm3R2OO3-xg87ohmxD-0ktebXG2m8pa3KWJwuNiJOAyh8b5NcNgFoM_6ZG01679">NEAR IN THE BLOOD OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="Y7KPbnfhmVACkNVkC3njcSpd8kicIRrpc5RUdAorxwk76X6_8r4-6ikKrq_X9AheN"> One matter that differs from our natural concept is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89767" data-verses="Ephesians 2:13">verse 13</span>. Here we are told that in Christ Jesus we “who once were far off have become near in the blood of Christ.” To whom have we become near? We have become near both to God and to one another. However, the emphasis in this verse is that the very blood of Christ through which we have been redeemed, brought back, brings us near to one another. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89768" data-verses="Ephesians 2:12">verse 12</span>, when we were apart from Christ, we were “alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.” If we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89769" data-verses="Ephesians 2:13">verse 13</span> in the light of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89770" data-verses="Ephesians 2:12">verse 12</span>, we shall realize that here the emphasis is upon becoming near to one another. Because we were fallen, we were far off from Christ, from the commonwealth of Israel, and from the covenants of God’s promise. But the redeeming blood of Christ has brought us back. Hence, in this blood we have become near both to God and to God’s people. <span class="pg" data-page-id="720" id="720">[720]</span> </p>

This very One came to preach the gospel of peace to us who were far off. This is the coming of Christ as the Spirit to preach the good news of the peace which He has accomplished through His cross. When Paul went to Ephesus, Christ went with him. Paul’s going was Christ’s going. Having come as the Spirit in Paul, Christ preached the gospel of peace. </p>
<p data-content-id="XN29daXoEaiDc-NwR9H8WYCbPCQLSqlHCNZd9RwShWBkL98XRz-1aU8fWCfEcI9un"> According to this verse, Christ did not mainly preach forgiveness or salvation. Rather, He preached the gospel concerning peace among the peoples. Have you ever realized that such a peace is related to the gospel? The gospel of peace involves not only the peace between man and God, but especially the peace between one man and another. For example, there is a need for peace between Germans and French, and between Chinese and Japanese. Just as there was enmity between the Jews and the Gentiles at the time of Paul, so there is enmity among peoples today. Among the different nations there is no real peace. Instead there is enmity. Hence, there is an urgent need not only for the preaching of the gospel concerning forgiveness, justification, salvation, grace, and regeneration, but also for the preaching of the gospel of peace. </p>
<p data-content-id="kW37bRWd4n3ChsU9j6t193omZSZGSNT7Km646Yo-l1oZoLWUehit8wxR0xamoxSLO"> Before the foundation of the world, God chose people from various nations to be part of the one Body and the one new man. Under the sovereignty of God, these different people have been brought together in the church life. According to the natural constitution, it is not possible for Chinese to be one with Japanese or French to be one with Germans. The only way for the different peoples to be one is through receiving the gospel of peace. One day the Lord came and preached peace as the gospel to us. We realized as a result <span class="pg" data-page-id="721" id="721">[721]</span> that we are now one with saints of every nationality and race. Today all who believe in Christ have one source, and this source is Christ Himself. Our source should no longer be our culture or nationality; it must be Christ and Christ alone. Once we were divided by our different sources, but now we are one in Christ as the unique source. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jf0PJ3Yzh-Zban-Z3PEii4PrkX0Gx6DqyCleWzpwECAyBCCrwndk4EBUpamTJ1Vjs"> It is easy to talk about this matter, but it is difficult to put it into practice. On the cross Christ abolished all the ordinances, and then He came to us preaching the gospel of peace. However, after we were saved and brought into Christ as the one source, the ordinances returned. </p>

He reminds us that we were Gentiles in the flesh, the ones “called uncircumcision by those who are called circumcision in the flesh made by hand.” He also reminds us that we were apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise. We were without hope and without God in the world. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89774" data-verses="Ephesians 2:13">Verse 13</span> opens with the words, “But now in Christ Jesus.” These words denote a change of source. Formerly we were outside of Christ; now we are in Christ and with Christ. In Christ Jesus we who once were far off have become near in the blood of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="bx_UdsKHw-vHF3mnF2hC5zEVqzAlEWM1-A9auvEbkRZG4a2E4SntYRIkifhdfEuRY"> Why does Paul mention the blood of Christ with respect to our being made near to one another? This reminds us that before we became near, we were among the fallen people. We needed to be redeemed, to be brought back by the precious blood of Christ. It was because of the fall that the human race was divided and scattered. Because we were fallen, we needed to be redeemed, to be brought back to God. Redemption has been accomplished through the blood of Christ. In this verse the blood signifies redemption. As the redeemed ones, we are now the brought-back ones. When we were fallen, we were divided and scattered. But having been redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, we have spontaneously become near not only to God but also to one another. <span class="pg" data-page-id="722" id="722">[722]</span> </p>

The peace spoken of here is not that between God and man, but that between one man and another. Having accomplished full redemption for us, Christ Himself is our peace, our harmony. After God called a chosen race out of fallen mankind, there was a separation between Israel and the nations. Through Christ’s redemption, this separation has been removed. Therefore, in the redeeming Christ we all are one. For this reason Paul says that Christ “has made both one.” The word both denotes the Jewish and Gentile believers. </p>

He broke down the middle wall of partition by abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances. His goal in doing so was to create the Jews and the Gentiles “in Himself into one new man.” By Christ’s abolishing the ordinances and creating the Jewish and Gentile believers into one new man, peace was made between all believers. Once again we see that the peace in this portion of the Word is the peace among those who believe in Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8r2GawReiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89785" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span> is an important chapter because it reveals that Christ died on the cross in order to create in Himself one new man. For the new man to come into being, the law of the commandments in ordinances had to be abolished. Christians realize that on the cross Christ dealt with sin, the old man, the flesh, the world, and the Devil, Satan. But very few Christians have seen that on the cross Christ also dealt with the ordinances. </p>
<p data-content-id="UFv9XTCpH0S8YL9S8-HfUxia1sj-WAvxyC1XFP6RGVw8XJ4F6ANbc4h5BJzV58HSy"> It is rather easy to understand that the cross of Christ deals with sin. It is also easy to realize that the old man and the flesh are problems that are dealt with by the cross. In like manner, when we read in the New Testament that the death of Christ has also dealt with the world and with Satan, we have no problem with understanding these truths. However, we may not realize that ordinances also present a serious problem. </p>
<p data-content-id="MiS0T4a3KCiS0HGposEC8jS0oqKsKv0mQ1p8RXf91j3qhYPyaQ4vSp2OaxeR_yzEI"> Ordinances are related to different ways of living and worship. They do not appear to be negative. On the contrary, they seem quite good. For example, some ordinances are related to table manners. Who can say it is not good to be properly regulated when we eat? However, different peoples have different kinds of table manners. Therefore, regulations concerning table manners can be a source of division and enmity between peoples. </p>
<p data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fB9SNPtcEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z"> Ordinances are involved in the matter of worship. The Jews worship God according to their ordinances, and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="728" id="728">[728]</span> Moslems worship according to their ordinances. This is also true with the various denominations today. Because ordinances seem helpful, it is difficult to recognize that they also need to be dealt with by the cross. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MiS0T4a3KCiS0HGposEC8jS0oqKJAv0mQ1p8RXf91j3qhYPyaQ4vSp2OaxeR_yzEI">REDEMPTION IN RELATION TO GOD’S PURPOSE</h2><p data-content-id="V6MWs_e1NOhU8pB_XSuN_fB9SNPMXEWPpUQRvAUnkLgGKSz0mlPVHdV5BtyQsf88Z"> The fall of mankind was the source of all ordinances. If man had not fallen, there would be no ordinances today. After God created man, He did not give him a list of ordinances. But as soon as man fell, the ordinances began to come in. Then, at Babel, the man created by God for His purpose became divided and scattered into a number of races and nations which began to fight against one another. This made it impossible for God’s eternal plan to be fulfilled. </p>
<p data-content-id="inTRR5aqA6f3Zp0g5VCt5vCcjxBsQPP9fz0SGMS6TD8Ev1RYK0XGG-yq2bZI5h3Uz"> If we view the redemption of Christ from the angle of God’s purpose, our concept of redemption will be broadened. Most Christians view Christ’s redemption only from the perspective of their personal salvation. They are not concerned with the fulfillment of God’s purpose, but are concerned only with being saved from hell and assured of spending eternity in heaven. Their concept of Christ’s death on the cross is extremely narrow. It is crucial for us to see that God’s eternal purpose is to dispense Himself into man and to become one with man in order to express Himself through man. But Satan has sought to frustrate the fulfillment of God’s purpose by damaging humanity through dividing it into different peoples who war against one another. Christ came to redeem fallen mankind in order that God’s purpose may be fulfilled, not merely that we may be saved from hell and assured of heaven. In order to redeem divided mankind, Christ died on the cross to deal with all the negative things, including ordinances. On the cross Christ abolished all the regulations regarding living and worship, regulations that have divided the nations. God does not care for any ordinances. He cares only that we are one and that Christ is wrought into us. Christ abolished all the ordinances not that we may go to heaven or that we may be spiritual or victorious. He abolished the ordinances in order to create in <span class="pg" data-page-id="729" id="729">[729]</span> Himself one new corporate man. He created the new man not only within Himself as the sphere, but also with Himself as the very element. By abolishing the ordinances and creating the Jewish and Gentile believers into one new man, Christ has made peace. Now those of different nationalities have peace in Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1j7GYWvBcpRDhfuCXsjS5EQAfI9Pvddik-vIuyg1p15aUEf3bUN3ejTNXHztc2C2_">IN CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bD_tOVJW0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89786" data-verses="Ephesians 2:11-12">2:11 and 12</span> Paul reminds us of our situation when we were apart from Christ. We were alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, we were strangers from the covenants of the promise, we had no hope, and we were without God in the world. We had no goal and no God. But one day we were called by God, and we answered His call by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. When we did this, the Triune God came into us. No matter where we may go, even if we try to run from the Lord or to stop believing in Him, He will always be with us. How wonderful that we have become involved with Christ! However, even when it does not seem so wonderful in our experience, we cannot get away from Him. We may try to leave Him, but He will never leave us. </p>
<p data-content-id="jzy56D5a4K14njv2OL9QfpnM83HnN1Ab9R3e21WSu1YH0DQn4sk-OuELvP5dRJ2jv"> As saved ones, we are in Christ. He is our sphere and our source. Now in Christ Jesus we who once were far off from God and from one another have become near in the blood of Christ. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89787" data-verses="Ephesians 2:14">verse 14</span> says, the very Christ who is our peace has made us one and has broken down the middle wall of partition. He has reconciled us to God in one Body, and He has come to preach to us the gospel of peace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89788" data-verses="Ephesians 2:16-17">vv. 16-17</span>). The result is that we are no longer strangers and sojourners, but fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the household of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89789" data-verses="Ephesians 2:19">v. 19</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="TS0vLm3wTVrzuTUulNHSpsNqxUDSyc-25mTg4xYz74KQnIYS77RmuCw_eSmkzr8AS"> Although Christ is our sphere, our source, and our peace and although He has abolished the ordinances, many Christians still hold to certain ordinances. In their practice, they care more for ordinances than for Christ. Many Christians neglect Christ and pay attention to the very ordinances He abolished on the cross. What a pitiful situation! <span class="pg" data-page-id="730" id="730">[730]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nFupmXdU7v_F8Wz3VyT4gw6NIecWHqgfhZHMQs6SxdJFG3VrWN2G3kyhCMk9WVErP">BUILT ON CHRIST AS THE FOUNDATION</h2><p data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR0MfBZ2OWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB"> Now we are in Christ. He should be the unique foundation upon which we are built. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89790" data-verses="Ephesians 2:20">2:20</span> Paul speaks of the foundation of the apostles and prophets. This refers to the Christ in whom the apostles believed and whom they ministered to others. The foundation of Moses was the law, and the foundation of the prophets was prophecy. But the only foundation of the apostles and prophets is Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89791" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:11">1 Corinthians 3:11</span> Paul said, “For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.” The foundation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89792" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span> is not related to any kind of ordinances; it is Christ Himself. The foundation of Judaism is composed of the Sabbath, circumcision, and the dietary regulations. But when the apostles came forth to minister, the unique foundation laid by them was the living Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4-0WofJDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> The church is built on Christ, not on ordinances or regulations. Today, however, all the denominations have another foundation besides Christ. For example, the Baptist denomination has immersion as a foundation along with Christ. It seems that underneath Christ as the foundation the denominations have something other than Christ as their basic foundation. The church has been divided by the different ordinances used as foundations. </p>
<p data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAzOqTlVnH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9"> May the Lord open our eyes to see how dreadful it is to cling to ordinances. We may claim to see the church, and we may declare that we are meeting as the local church. But if we still insist on particular practices, those practices will become ordinances. Spontaneously, the ground of oneness will be damaged or even lost. Instead of meeting on the ground of oneness, we shall meet on the ground of our ordinances. If a certain ordinance becomes our ground, we cease to be the church and become a sect. Whenever we insist on a particular practice, we lose the unique ground of oneness. This is why we should not insist on things such as pray-reading or calling on the name of the Lord, even though we may receive great benefit from them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="731" id="731">[731]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89808" data-verses="Ephesians 2:21">verse 21</span> we see the universal building, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89809" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">verse 22</span>, the local building. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89810" data-verses="Ephesians 2:21">Verse 21</span> says, “In Whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.” The phrase “all the building” denotes the universal building, the church throughout the universe. The words “in Whom you also” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89811" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">verse 22</span> denote the local building, the building among those in the city to which this Epistle was sent. The building, therefore, has a universal aspect and a local aspect. It is significant that this chapter of Ephesians concludes with the building of the church in these two aspects. </p>
<p data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR0MQBZrMWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB"> For centuries, this matter of the building has been neglected. Very few servants of the Lord have given it adequate attention. Beginning in 1938, among us the Lord began to emphasize the importance of the building. Message after message has been given on this crucial subject. Among them are the messages printed in <em>The Vision of God’s Building</em>. The messages in that book cover God’s building as revealed from the beginning of the Bible to the end. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4-7WoGKDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu">FORSAKING ALL ORDINANCES</h2><p data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAzOlTl8tH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9"> If we would be built up universally and locally, we must forsake all ordinances. To hold to certain ordinances is to build without a proper foundation, that is, without Christ as the unique foundation. Many Christians are not clear about Christ as the unique foundation, and they do not know God’s building. Therefore, they have spent years wandering from one denomination or Christian group to another. Such <span class="pg" data-page-id="736" id="736">[736]</span> believers may be stones for God’s building, but they have not yet been built in. Some church-traveling Christians may claim that the reason for their wandering from group to group is a sense of dissatisfaction. However, the underlying reason is ordinances. </p>
<p data-content-id="wZZd7ZXC7lqDMlD_3-HJuDfzd2iIDM5RxitkD5PpVOrwkpldqqeIgnRv2-Kvi2tyM"> Ordinances may be related to our natural disposition. Some have a quiet disposition and prefer Christian meetings where the believers worship in silence. They wander from group to group in quest of a meeting to match their disposition. They may think that a particular group suits their taste, only to learn that certain practices there do not match their disposition. Such Christians are not satisfied with any group. They cannot find a group that is fully in accord with their disposition. </p>
<p data-content-id="8h6Q8qq7fu5OpgOocEN7Cqtvhk5Cf-y1o55tduWJ4FjR4dq0idwixNOYWvRUriXAE"> If we have seen a clear vision of God’s economy and know what the recovery is, we shall be willing to forget our disposition, to deny our taste, and to care only for the Lord’s recovery. The recovery is not based on any practice; it is based on Christ who is our peace, our foundation, our cornerstone, and our everything. The vision of God’s economy must control us, direct us, and restrict us. Such a vision will surely cause us to stand on Christ as the unique foundation. Then instead of being wandering stars (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89812" data-verses="Jude 1:13">Jude 13</span>), we shall be those who can be built up with others. We shall be eternally settled in God’s economy. Those who have seen this vision and are governed by it can be built up with others on the unique foundation of the all-inclusive Christ. They will not allow any ordinances to become their foundation. </p>
<p data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUm64oJQ3XNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0"> Once again I wish to use pray-reading as an example. We thank the Lord for pray-reading. Although we have not made pray-reading an ordinance, some have left the church life simply because they did not care for this practice. Do you think that someone who leaves the church for such a reason has truly seen what the church is? I do not think so. One who has seen the vision of the church will never leave. </p>
<p data-content-id="7_JcBoLt_f4p4TwS9GhdcDPKQ4eOJ0dHgTG9jncdwDuWZJuJ-gcIVOYb7Z2qhulnR"> Some Christians have criticized us not only for the practice of pray-reading, but also for praising the Lord loudly, <span class="pg" data-page-id="737" id="737">[737]</span> for calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, and for allowing believers to be baptized again, that is, to be “buried.” Others have criticized us for emphasizing the fact that Christ is versus religion. If we in the local churches have something related to idols, immorality, division, or the denial of the deity of Christ, we should be criticized. However, it is wrong to criticize us for such things as pray-reading the Word or calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. If believers are helped spiritually by these practices, what right have others to criticize them? Those who do not follow these practices should nevertheless be one with those who receive benefit by following them. Suppose a certain brother is convicted of his oldness and deadness and is led of the Lord to bury himself in the waters of baptism. After his burial, he is refreshed, renewed, and living. He may even praise the Lord in a loud, excited way. Should he be condemned because he was baptized a second time or because he praises the Lord with a loud voice? Certainly not! Nevertheless, some believers may criticize such a one because they still have ordinances related to baptism or to loud praises. </p>
<p data-content-id="_gz5R_nH5oLy8-la4zwars7JfBAIZijurKKMBUDGJR9KRsTuy0qXMYueEupKE4DZW"> Many years ago there was a certain Presbyterian pastor who was the top theologian in China. As a Presbyterian, in his teaching he should have opposed the practice of immersion and favored sprinkling. However, as he was praying one day on a mountain, he experienced the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. As he was running down the mountainside, he saw a pool of water and threw himself into it. After that experience, he became a different person, very living in the Lord. Those who hold to ordinances may criticize him. But the Lord does not honor ordinances. In Christ neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, only a new creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89813" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">Gal. 6:15</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="B77vULL4YXIHFFm6havIcY9BcVNW0oUVhHMvf-EO7Y7mN_8U3mz_Sb5pyhxZje63p">CARING ONLY FOR CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="xOItbD1M_SnXcAkcMHRO0aDlkC_nGBIPiZ8yi6s5e1DrTLjV78UWPV1TgR921-jvh"> Although there are millions of Christians on earth today, very few have been built up with others. The reason for this lack of building is that so many believers still hold on to ordinances. Perhaps you were a member of a certain <span class="pg" data-page-id="738" id="738">[738]</span> denomination. However, because of your ordinances, you were not one with others, and you were not able to be built up with them. Rather, you were waiting for the situation to change to fit your ordinances. When there was no change or improvement, you moved to another group, hoping to find there a situation to suit your preference. This has caused many to travel from one denomination to another. Some have testified that they were not satisfied until they came into the church life. Although it is true that we are satisfied spiritually in the church, we must be careful not to hold to any ordinances. In our experience Christ must be everything to us: our peace, our foundation, our cornerstone. We should not care for anything other than Christ. Whether the meetings are noisy or quiet makes no difference. We are not for noise or for silence—we are for Christ. By caring only for Christ, we can easily be one with others and be built up with them locally and universally on Christ as the unique foundation. </p>
<p data-content-id="rzBtTvnnp8EWQ9SXyt4WJFpiEK0wcN18pC-iFM-wWF7biwez5fLvQHeKFo4_b1dI7"> Recently I have been burdened of the Lord to give a number of messages dealing with ordinances. I believe that the Spirit of the Lord within us realizes how important it is for us to be clear about this matter. As more saints turn to the way of the Lord’s recovery, it is possible for ordinances to be brought in or for dissenting opinions to be expressed. Therefore, it is crucial that we learn to care only for Christ, particularly as we visit localities where the way of meeting differs from that to which we are accustomed. We should not evaluate a meeting according to whether or not the saints practice pray-reading, exercise tongues-speaking, or pray long prayers or short ones. We should care for Christ and for Christ alone. If we care only for Christ, we shall not have any problems with oneness. The more we care for Christ and drop all manner of ordinances, the more we shall be built up in Christ locally and also universally. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dvx25G8sssSYMALmWN9v-wwnL3yAtwN7G3_YIZuDLoUsHACVRNy6oYa6xgCQFEpxU">NO ORGANIZATION</h2><p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9rgVFU3TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> In speaking of the universal building, we must be careful to distinguish such building from organization. Although we <span class="pg" data-page-id="739" id="739">[739]</span> are absolutely for the proper building, we are opposed to organization. The churches will be built together universally, but this does not mean that they will be universally organized. </p>

<p data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiEPkr6yt8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND"> God created mankind for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. However, through the fall, mankind was divided and scattered. When Christ died on the cross to accomplish redemption, He slew all the ordinances in order to bring His chosen people back into oneness and to create in Himself one new man. However, the enemy, Satan, has used ordinances to divide the new man Christ has created. The divisions, denominations, and sects in Christianity have their source in these ordinances. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="P5LAppNM9anuOY8qKFZGxcab9XKMNW6wXX1IPiDZBj9REBKOwCbu8774faHM2uakW">THE CAUSE OF DIVISION</h2><p data-content-id="-xjGehvejCQlzalTuo32KU27bU96fuPgtsH4FEYaUB1lCP61PJ3xPUdWBlbNL_kSt"> Today the Lord is seeking to recover His church by bringing His people out of the divisions. To be brought out of division is to be brought out of ordinances as the source of division. Therefore, in order to recover the church, the Lord must cause His people to set aside the ordinances that have been the cause of division. If we are not clear about this matter of ordinances, we may bring ordinances into the church life and cause a repetition of the divisiveness that has occurred in the history of Christianity. We do not want the history of Christianity to be repeated among us in the Lord’s recovery. </p>
<p data-content-id="pUgU6yw7JGTUYrgFoe8JTp36SQJiYv7TrTsP0dxOoJBaWmsdb5vA9y_VoOGAtYpSI"> Certain dear ones who love the Lord’s recovery may not be clear about ordinances. If they insist on practices that correspond to their ordinances, they will cause problems in the churches. Although we may see the ground of the church, we cannot be in the church life in a secure way until we have a thorough understanding of ordinances. It is not <span class="pg" data-page-id="744" id="744">[744]</span> sufficient simply to forsake divisions. We also need to recognize that ordinances are the source of division. </p>
<p data-content-id="vNGdZHHY14iAb_v6HwIE3H66HAnwWeE22cQi8F0_YUxRFUJ9ktsfg-XG_7irJOOpq"> As the Lord’s recovery spreads throughout the world, people with different backgrounds will be brought in. Since there is no organization nor human control in the recovery, it is possible in certain places for saints to insist on various practices. If this should happen, the church life would be seriously damaged through division. Therefore, I encourage you all to bring this matter of ordinances to the Lord. Ask Him to make you crystal clear about the seriousness of having ordinances in the church life. No ground whatever can be given to the insistence upon any practice. For the building up of the church we must be willing to drop all ordinances. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6p9SITWrFEwtbMZBod1QrR0MRBZ2GWxBYZLYjbISmOzX2SumVup61JreHF56G2whB">ORDINANCES AND DOCTRINE</h2><p data-content-id="ROFG1FBoZhXM5MqhRUx9oc4-6WofBDo7LE-XkxGKop66uDMfcDYmd8RfVeJ2LdZhu"> We have pointed out that in Ephesians, a book concerned not with personal salvation but with the church in a corporate way, there are at least four categories of things that damage the church life: ordinances, doctrine, the old man, and the spots and wrinkles. After a number of messages concerning ordinances, we come now to the subject of doctrine. Most doctrines are based on ordinances, and ordinances are produced from doctrines. It is difficult to say which comes first, doctrines or ordinances. On the one hand, doctrines produce ordinances, but, on the other hand, ordinances provide the basis for doctrine. Nevertheless, we can be clear that these two matters are intimately related and cannot be separated. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAzOkTlZlH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9">THE NEED FOR HUMAN COOPERATION</h2><p data-content-id="wZZd7ZXC7lqDMlD_3-HJuDfzc2ipKM5RxitkD5PpVOrwkpldqqeIgnRv2-Kvi2tyM"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89824" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Chapter one</span> of Ephesians speaks of the Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89825" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Chapter two</span> speaks of the one new man and concludes with a word about God’s building. For the sake of the new man, God is dispensing Himself into His chosen people, as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89826" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">chapter three</span>. All Three of the Godhead are involved in this dispensation. We are strengthened by the Spirit into the inner man, so that <span class="pg" data-page-id="745" id="745">[745]</span> Christ may make His home in our hearts, with the result that we are filled unto all the fullness of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89827" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">3:8</span> Paul speaks of the riches of Christ. If the new man is to be built up as the habitation of God in spirit, surely the riches of Christ need to be dispensed into every part of this new man. In order for such a dispensation to take place, the inner man of all those who make up the one new man must be strengthened by the Spirit. Then Christ with all His riches will be able to make His home in our hearts. Eventually, the new man will be filled unto all the fullness of God. This indicates that the new man will be a God-filled man, a corporate entity mingled with the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lf1K-y3L5TMbnhwIdXj6o5eO1ryI5O0PfvmyhE0ytAQCUFPR0wah9lN54TeYKuRo6"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89828" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Chapter three</span> of Ephesians ends with the new man filled unto all the fullness of God. This, however, is not the end of the book. There is still the need for human cooperation. Although Christ has abolished all the ordinances in order to create the new man, the church as the new man still needs to be built up. Christ does not build the church directly. Rather, He uses the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers to perfect the saints to carry out the direct building up of the church. As the Head, Christ presents certain gifts to His Body for the perfecting of the saints. Having been perfected through the ministry of these gifts, the saints build the church directly. Hence, the church is not directly built by Christ or by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers; it is built directly by the perfected saints. This indicates that the building of the church requires the cooperation of God’s people. </p>
<p data-content-id="mYU5S9W2yAOJugOepbb3U6oR6PdlgLpqZHMRjbSIXvhm8n02UbUOuKffanshRavP9"> Some readers of Ephesians may think that Paul should have stopped at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89829" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">chapter three</span>. According to their opinion, the end of this chapter is the high point and completion of the book. They see only the fact that Christ has accomplished everything. Yes, Christ has been incarnated, has passed through human life, and has died on the cross to accomplish redemption and to deal with all negative things, including ordinances. After His all-inclusive death, He rested in the tomb. This rest was a true Sabbath. Then on the first day of the week He was resurrected from among <span class="pg" data-page-id="746" id="746">[746]</span> the dead, and a new age with a new humanity came into being. On God’s side, everything has been accomplished. But in His economy God requires human cooperation. His economy is based on the principle of incarnation, that is, of God and man mingled and working together to accomplish God’s goal. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89830" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> the Lord Jesus said, “Apart from Me you can do nothing” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89831" data-verses="John 15:5">v. 5</span>). However, it is also true that apart from us Christ can do nothing. We can tell the Lord, “Lord Jesus, just as I need You, You also need me. We can do nothing without You, and You can do nothing without us.” If we would speak to the Lord in this way, He would agree. The very fact that Christ was incarnated indicates that God’s economy has both the divine aspect and the human aspect. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZF7iQ7T0lQJP8gtIC7nMKHRSsLd4AgK5Boj8tqPtmmD8KvxV6FuuLU1d_HGholgwP"> This principle applies to the book of Ephesians. The first three chapters emphasize the divine aspect. These chapters reveal that Christ has accomplished everything and that the new man has been filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89832" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapters four through six</span> we see the human aspect, the aspect of our cooperation with the Lord. Hallelujah, we need God, and God needs us! If we fail to cooperate with Him, we cause a serious problem. Therefore, it is crucial that we fulfill our responsibility to cooperate with God in the carrying out of His economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OoqZSb02SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH">NOT MERE TEACHING, BUT GROWTH</h2><p data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2etwRK13kgmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg"> Many Christians think that what is mainly needed on the human side is teaching. Yes, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89833" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span> Paul does mention shepherds and teachers. However, the concept here is altogether different from the religious concept in today’s Christianity. Christianity has become a religion of doctrine. No other religion in the world has as many doctrines as Christianity has. Consider how many books are put out by Christian writers every year. Surely no other religion can equal it in the number of books published annually. Most of these books merely feed the desire for doctrinal talk. Furthermore, most of these books are related to ordinances. Because someone favors a particular practice, he writes a book in order to advocate it. <span class="pg" data-page-id="747" id="747">[747]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiEPkr6ju8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND"> Paul’s concept in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89834" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">Ephesians 4</span> is absolutely different from the concept in today’s Christianity. The basic concept in this chapter is that of growth until we all arrive at a full-grown man. As all mothers know, growth of children comes by feeding, not mainly by teaching. When we all arrive at a full-grown man, we shall no longer be children spiritually. On the human side the main need is not doctrine; it is growth. We need to grow until we arrive at a full-grown man. </p>

The other three categories are ordinances, the old man, and the spots and wrinkles. Because in our natural, religious concept, doctrine is positive and is viewed positively by most Christians, it is difficult to speak about doctrine in a negative way. Doctrine, however, can frustrate the building up of the Body of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89846" data-verses="Ephesians 4:14">4:14</span> Paul speaks of the negative effect of doctrine: “That we may be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.” Not many Christians have paid adequate attention to this verse, a verse which indicates that doctrine can damage the Body of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="XN29daXoEaiDc-NwR9H8WYCfJCQWYqlHCNZd9RwShWBkL98XRz-1aU8fWCfEcI9un"> According to the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus had a difficult time with those religious people who were steeped in doctrine. The scribes, Pharisees, elders, and chief priests argued with Him over doctrine. Little did they realize that they were actually arguing with God, the One who inspired the Old Testament on which their doctrines were based. In their blindness they used the Scriptures to argue with the One who inspired the Scriptures and whose coming the Scriptures foretold. Those who were occupied with doctrine missed the opportunity to gain Christ. They did not realize that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, God was not concerned for doctrine, but for Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="752" id="752">[752]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="kW37bRWd4n3ChsU9j6t193oifSZfZNT7Km646Yo-l1oZoLWUehit8wxR0xamoxSLO">DAMAGED BY DOCTRINE AND PHILOSOPHY</h2><p data-content-id="Jf0PJ3Yzh-Zban-Z3PEii4PviX0j56DqyCleWzpwECAyBCCrwndk4EBUpamTJ1Vjs"> After the church had been established and had begun to spread, problems in the churches were caused by doctrine. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89847" data-verses="Romans 14:1">Romans 14</span> indicates this. The doctrines concerning eating and observing days were derived from Judaism, not from heathen philosophy. Although the Roman Empire did persecute the church, this persecution did not damage the church life. However, damage was caused by religious doctrine. The situation that made it necessary to call the conference described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89848" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span> was caused by doctrine. Just as doctrine caused damage to the church life in the first century, it can damage the church life in the Lord’s recovery today. </p>
<p data-content-id="ziHhFbwj9qduVCwT62zA_ZSSmUWkCVUD31ttVpb1c14zDjDyuEyTtvwQz3ufe66GN"> The church life has also been damaged by philosophy, especially by Gnosticism with all its concepts. If we bring in concepts derived from our cultural background, we shall cause problems in the church life. The church life in the Lord’s recovery can still be damaged by doctrine and philosophy. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9voVFU_TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk"> Most Christians appreciate those who are knowledgeable in the Scriptures. But, in a sense, it may be a dreadful thing to acquire a vast knowledge of the Bible, if our Bible knowledge causes us to miss Christ. Remember that it was those who knew the Scriptures—the Pharisees and the scribes—who persecuted the Lord Jesus and the apostles. The principle is the same today. The ones who are most opposed to the Lord’s recovery are those with a certain amount of Bible knowledge. </p>

However, many Christians care more for doctrine than for Christ and the church. God’s economy is not to have a group of people who know the Bible. It is to work Christ into His chosen people for the building up of the Body. We must condemn any doctrine that distracts us from Christ or that hinders us from being built up in the Body. Even doctrines that are scriptural or fundamental may be used by the enemy to distract us from Christ and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="753" id="753">[753]</span> church. Satan hates to see God’s people built up in the Body. Although God’s goal is to produce the Body by working Christ into us, most of His people have been distracted from God’s economy and from His eternal purpose. Doctrines are among the good things utilized by Satan in his subtlety to distract God’s people from God’s will. The reason God has put His seal upon the recovery of the church is that in the recovery we are pursuing God’s goal, not mere doctrinal knowledge. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ORuveXsLSL_KAUQRmmsRwUALmxfJgsZhadewDeZFVr0RNBcjRKpEUgJ7ZofkxfD26">THE SUBJECTIVE HOLD OF DOCTRINE</h2><p data-content-id="4hu3V9NSxOD4qIDQx-aI8ny7PXQARHAukquOkznsExY9T1eCWD6YHuZmIvOhld_9j"> Deep within, even unconsciously, some of us may still be holding on to certain doctrines. These doctrines hidden within us may cause us one day to become dissenting. This can happen to sisters as well as to brothers. Actually, doctrines often have a stronger hold on sisters than on brothers. According to my experience, it is much harder for a sister to let go of a doctrine than it is for a brother. The reason is that, as far as doctrine is concerned, sisters are subjective, whereas the brothers are objective. Hence, it is difficult for sisters to change their doctrine. The trouble in the church life caused by doctrine is often backed, supported, and strengthened by sisters. This tendency for sisters to hold on to doctrine can frustrate, damage, and even destroy the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="od6p5sc1GDqOFwWB01GI4UNVAvyh0TvvTOTFDcnJar4LT8Qnqe8UcaKDTX05Qn6K7"> We have pointed out that although Christ has done everything necessary to produce the church, there is still the need for the church to be built up in a practical way. This involves our cooperation. The last three chapters of Ephesians emphasize human cooperation for the building up of the Body. </p>

However, the details are found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89850" data-verses="Ephesians 4:16">4:16</span>. “Out from Whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one <span class="pg" data-page-id="754" id="754">[754]</span> part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.” By growing up into the Head, the members of the Body have something to share with one another. Furthermore, there will be the operation in the measure of each part, and the result will be the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. In order to have the reality of this verse, we must be perfected by the gifts given to the Body by the Head. The saints are not perfected merely by learning doctrine. On the contrary, they are perfected through being fed. This feeding causes them to grow. For example, an infant does not need anything to be added on to his body to perfect him. As he grows, the members of his body develop and begin to function normally. A mother does not perfect her baby by teaching him to use the various parts of his body; she perfects him by feeding him. The more a child grows through receiving proper nourishment, the more the members of his body will come into their function. In the same principle, the members of the Body are perfected not by teaching, but through the feeding that causes them to grow. </p>

Then we shall be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89852" data-verses="Ephesians 4:14">v. 14</span>). Instead, we shall hold to truth in love so that we may “grow up into Him in all things, Who is the Head, Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89853" data-verses="Ephesians 4:15">v. 15</span>). The more we grow, the more we shall drop our doctrines. After someone is saved, he needs to have Christ ministered to him as his spiritual food and drink. This will cause him to grow. As he grows, he will gradually lay aside his doctrinal concepts. Eventually he will realize that nothing is more important than having Christ wrought into him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="755" id="755">[755]</span> </p>

However, if we hold to our different doctrinal concepts, we shall not have this oneness. The emphasis on doctrine has destroyed the oneness among Christians. If we are nourished with the element of Christ and gradually lay aside our doctrinal concepts, we shall arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. The more we grow, the more we arrive at such a oneness. </p>

This indicates that we need to distinguish between the faith and doctrine. Regarding the faith—what we must believe in order to be saved—the New Testament is strong, strict, and consistent. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89875" data-verses="Jude 1:3">Jude 3</span> we are even told that we “should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.” Concerning the faith, we must be ready to fight. We should not merely insist on the faith and stand for it, but fight for it at any cost, even at the cost of our life. The faith for which we must fight is the common faith, the Christian faith, the faith that saves us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7_JcBoLt_f4p4TwS9GhdcDPOZ4eTB0dHgTG9jncdwDuWZJuJ-gcIVOYb7Z2qhulnR">LIBERAL WITH OTHERS REGARDING DOCTRINE</h2><p data-content-id="_gz5R_nH5oLy8-la4zwars7NWBARQijurKKMBUDGJR9KRsTuy0qXMYueEupKE4DZW"> In contrast, in the New Testament we are never charged to fight for doctrine. As far as doctrine is concerned, the New Testament is liberal. Take the example of eating what has been sacrificed to idols. If you read what Paul says about this in Romans and in 1 Corinthians, you may be puzzled. In some places Paul indicates that it is permissible to eat what has been offered to idols. However, in other places he strongly advises against this practice. Years ago, I spent a great deal of time trying to understand this. Troubled by what seemed to be an inconsistency in Paul’s writings, I wondered why he did not tell us in a straightforward way whether or not we should eat things that have been sacrificed to idols. Only after I had been delivered from preoccupation with doctrine did I come to understand that Paul <span class="pg" data-page-id="760" id="760">[760]</span> wrote different things on different occasions about eating because he was liberal with respect to doctrine. He knew that under certain circumstances it was permissible to eat, whereas in other circumstances it was not. Only when you have been delivered from preoccupation with doctrine will you be able to understand that certain matters pertaining to doctrine are relative to the situation. This is why Paul could say one thing on one occasion and something else on a different occasion. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="B77vULL4YXIHFFm6havIcY9FVVNz6oUVhHMvf-EO7Y7mN_8U3mz_Sb5pyhxZje63p">FOUR NEGATIVE THINGS</h2><p data-content-id="xOItbD1M_SnXcAkcMHRO0aDhtC_GJBIPiZ8yi6s5e1DrTLjV78UWPV1TgR921-jvh"> Concerning the eating of meat or the observing of certain days, Paul did not take a definite stand. On the contrary, in these matters he was liberal. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89876" data-verses="Romans 16:17">Romans 16:17</span> he said strongly, “Now I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.” As far as doctrines go, Paul was liberal, but as far as divisiveness was concerned, he was definite. He told us to mark out those who cause division and to avoid them. </p>
<p data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2et0ZK13sgmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89877" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:7-11">1 Corinthians 5:7-11</span> Paul deals with fornication and idolatry. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89878" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:9">verse 9</span> he charges the saints “not to company with fornicators.” Fornication damages humanity, and idolatry is an insult to God. Although Paul was liberal with respect to doctrine, he would not tolerate anything related to fornication or idolatry. His word about these things is strong and definite. </p>
<p data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiELsr6jm8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89879" data-verses="Titus 3:10">Titus 3:10</span> Paul says, “A man that is factious, after the first and second admonition, reject” (Gk.). A factious person is divisive and sectarian. After such a one has been admonished once or twice, he should be rejected if he continues in his divisiveness. There can be no compromise or neutrality. Therefore, regarding idolatry, fornication, and divisiveness Paul was very strict, and we must be strict also. </p>
<p data-content-id="P5LAppNM9anuOY8qKFZGxcaf1XKRFW6wXX1IPiDZBj9REBKOwCbu8774faHM2uakW"> According to the Second Epistle of John, we see that we must also reject those who deny the incarnation of Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89880" data-verses="2John 1:7">Verse 7</span> says, “For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="761" id="761">[761]</span> is a deceiver and an antichrist.” This verse indicates that even in the first century there were certain ones who called themselves Christians, but who did not confess that Christ was God come in the flesh. In other words they denied the fact that Christ was God incarnated. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89881" data-verses="2John 1:9">verse 9</span> the writer goes on to say, “Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.” The word transgress here means to go a little farther. The Bible reveals that Christ is God incarnated. Those who denied this went too far; they had given up the teaching that Christ is God incarnate. Hence, the Apostle John warned the believers concerning this kind of person: “If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God-speed: for he that biddeth him God-speed is partaker of his evil deeds” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89882" data-verses="2John 1:10-11">vv. 10-11</span>). We cannot receive those who do deny the incarnation of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="-xjGehvejCQlzalTuo32KU2_TU9jWuPgtsH4FEYaUB1lCP61PJ3xPUdWBlbNL_kSt"> According to the New Testament, there are four things which we cannot tolerate: idolatry, fornication, division, and the denial of the deity of Christ. Concerning the faith, we must be bold, strong, and definite, ready to contend for the faith once delivered to the saints. However, as far as doctrines are concerned, we must be liberal with others. Nevertheless, we cannot tolerate idolatry, fornication, division, and the denial of the incarnation of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="pUgU6yw7JGTUYrgFoe8JTp3-aQJHWv7TrTsP0dxOoJBaWmsdb5vA9y_VoOGAtYpSI">PRACTICING ROMANS 14</h2><p data-content-id="vNGdZHHY14iAb_v6HwIE3H6-PAnRZeE22cQi8F0_YUxRFUJ9ktsfg-XG_7irJOOpq"> Apart from the four negative things mentioned above, we cannot find a fifth item in the New Testament concerning which we should be strict in accepting others. Yes, the New Testament commands us to love one another. However, it does not say that we should reject a person if he does not follow the teaching about loving others. The same is true regarding the doctrine of foot-washing. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89883" data-verses="John 13:1">John 13</span> the Lord Jesus speaks of washing one another’s feet. However, this chapter does not say that we should refuse to have fellowship with another believer because he does not practice foot-washing. In the same principle, although the New <span class="pg" data-page-id="762" id="762">[762]</span> Testament speaks emphatically about baptism, we are never told to reject a believer because he has not been baptized. We should not separate ourselves from those believers who differ from us in doctrine. </p>
<p data-content-id="WMnpS5Obzk_YTS3q3GOFH1SttAwpIrnZYpJ1P_jLUOjwyCSv5ZbC6HMtrIdmASj5I"> We need to remember <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89884" data-verses="Romans 14:1">Romans 14</span> and practice it. Today many Christian teachers are talking about the Body in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89885" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span> without paying adequate attention to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89886" data-verses="Romans 14:1">Romans 14</span>. Apart from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89887" data-verses="Romans 14:1">Romans 14</span> we cannot practice the Body life revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89888" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span>. Only through being liberal toward others with respect to doctrine can we have the Body life. </p>
<p data-content-id="2dq7QF0hlVfHljch6uMOWbrkw8vUtD7PM_en5LHupWopm5T9JM8tlnCWOoNUSQNy6"> Among many Christians today there is no practice of the Body life. Instead, there is division after division. In fact, there is more division among earnest Christians than among those who are worldly or indifferent to the Lord and His Word. When Christians are revived and renewed in reading the Bible, they are more easily divided over doctrine. Because of the divisiveness in today’s Christianity, most Christians do not have the Body life. This is especially true in the charismatic movement. Although many in this movement are fond of talking about the Body, there is more divisiveness in the charismatic movement than in any other aspect of Christianity. The reason for this is that Christians talk about <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89889" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span>, but neglect <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89890" data-verses="Romans 14:1">Romans 14</span>. I repeat, only by practicing <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89891" data-verses="Romans 14:1">Romans 14</span> do we have the reality of the Body described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89892" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="uRn6e8DCDhYvxWArZZyg1AApSPaenbWQ-S4ajELiYI6nagGr9Sjsomhlk1pMnAffa"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89893" data-verses="Romans 14:1">Romans 14</span>, there is room in the church life for those with different doctrines. Some believe that they can eat everything, whereas others eat only herbs. In like manner, some observe certain days, whereas others regard every day the same. Do you realize that in the church life there can be different doctrines, and there should be? Take the example of head covering. Some sisters wear a head covering in the meetings, but many sisters do not. This indicates that among the sisters there are different doctrines concerning head covering. It is a very positive sign that the church can include both those sisters who wear a head covering and those who do not. I have been in Christian <span class="pg" data-page-id="763" id="763">[763]</span> meetings where sisters without a head covering were not welcome. Furthermore, the sisters who wear a head covering have different kinds of coverings and coverings of different colors. But I have been in meetings where the sisters were required to wear head coverings of the same size, style, and color. Praise the Lord that in the church life we are not divided over different matters such as these! How wonderful that in the church we receive those with different doctrines concerning head covering! </p>

The full-grown man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89899" data-verses="Ephesians 4:13">verse 13</span> is the new man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89900" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">verse 24</span>. Hence, in Ephesians the new man is referred to three times. </p>
<p data-content-id="4hu3V9NSxOD4qIDQx-aI8ny7NXQdfHAukquOkznsExY9T1eCWD6YHuZmIvOhld_9j"> Some versions make a serious error in rendering <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89901" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">4:24</span>. For example, the Revised Standard Version says “put on the new nature.” What a poor translation! The Greek word here is <em>anthropos,</em> the same word used for man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89902" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">2:15</span>. The New American Standard Version also makes a serious mistake by rendering this verse, “put on the new self.” Very few Christian writers have recognized that the new man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89903" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">4:24</span> is the church. In his <em>Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words,</em> W. E. Vine points out that the new man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89904" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">4:24</span> is the church which is Christ’s Body. He clearly connects <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89905" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">4:24</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89906" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">2:15</span>. No doubt the one new man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89907" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">4:24</span> is the new man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89908" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">2:15</span>, for the same term is used in each case. </p>
<p data-content-id="od6p5sc1GDqOFwWB01GI4UNVCvy47TvvTOTFDcnJar4LT8Qnqe8UcaKDTX05Qn6K7"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89909" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">2:15</span> we have the creation of the new man. We may regard this creation as the birth of the new man. Just as a child is perfected through growth, so the new man created in Christ is also perfected through growth. This is the reason Paul refers to the new man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89910" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span> as well as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89911" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">chapter two</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3GEuFAt2o9byg8MZDzK996m3-fHSPXg_LkbTuP-LW2tuU3xrWTByUo7lMUOiCI2ZU">PERFECT ORGANICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY</h2><p data-content-id="GJHsP88GHseo8rpjYyem_lGvQqQUz4KrNMLYo1DtwblC8XXjSuatQl8WDTK_MeK3O"> We may distinguish between something that is perfect, or <span class="pg" data-page-id="768" id="768">[768]</span> complete organically and something that is perfect according to its function. At birth, an infant is perfect organically; that is, the infant has all the necessary organs. However, a child is not functionally perfect at birth. Organically, a mother cannot help her child, for she cannot add any organs to the child. But she can help him functionally by feeding him so that he will grow normally. Although only God the Creator can produce an organism that is perfect organically, we as parents must help our children become perfect functionally. We fulfill this responsibility by nourishing our children and cherishing them. In order to develop properly and to function normally, every child needs to be nourished and cherished. This principle also applies to the church as the new man. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89912" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">2:15</span> we see the creation of the new man organically, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89913" data-verses="Ephesians 4:13-16">4:13-16</span> we see the perfecting of the new man in relation to his function. </p>
<p data-content-id="cUZm3R2OO3-xg87ohmxD-0kpabXb8m8pa3KWJwuNiJOAyh8b5NcNgFoM_6ZG01679"> In this respect, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89914" data-verses="Ephesians 4:16">4:16</span> is an extremely important verse. Here Paul says, “Out from Whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.” Our growth in life is to grow into the Head, Christ, but our function in the Body is to function out from Him. The phrase “each one part” refers to every member of the Body. Every member of the Body of Christ has its own measure which works for the growth of the Body. The Body causes the growth of itself through the supplying joints and working parts. The growth of the Body is the increase of Christ in the church, which results in the building up of the Body itself. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y7KPbnfhmVACkNVkC3njcSpZ4kiFDRrpc5RUdAorxwk76X6_8r4-6ikKrq_X9AheN"> There is no verse such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89915" data-verses="Ephesians 4:16">4:16</span> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89916" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89917" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">chapter two</span> we have the birth of the new man, but not the function of the new man. At birth, the new man is organically perfect; however, he is not yet able to function. Just as a child needs to be perfected through nourishing and cherishing, so the organically perfect new man needs to be perfected through the growth of life in order to function in a proper way. </p>
<p data-content-id="EkaMV3Soowz1Y1LdwSAggrak6cxws6M0H0MN5WrZ4ZYcDUwX2c921mm7c4iIL8IZY"> Our physical life portrays this. Only God can create a being that is organically perfect. However, after a child is <span class="pg" data-page-id="769" id="769">[769]</span> born, God does not come in to feed him or cherish him. This is the responsibility of the parents, especially of the mother. The more the child is nourished and grows, the more he will function normally. </p>
<p data-content-id="D20V42Q_F8EMHQVYOrygvO7hw2B2s4EAp5I6xaxu5BS3a8z8gUxLYQQk1sl7LSiAO"> In the same principle, the new man created by Christ must be perfected in order to function. Through the growth spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89918" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span>, the new man comes into function. Through the operation in the measure of each part, the Body grows unto the building up of itself in love. The creation of the new man was the responsibility of the Lord alone. We have nothing whatever to do with this. But we must fulfill our responsibility to perfect the new man through nourishing and cherishing. As the new man is perfected in this way, he grows and becomes perfect functionally. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="S26jTFFVZnj955_hMlMnIhYIyMx0hdPkCD61VuHGKt4L3wCMJyIZ3UBt_LzbPLTVG">GROWTH THROUGH FEEDING</h2><p data-content-id="gBi8-OiEa7te_n7JZc2wVW6cmMFH-ZhCfpqqsc2x3FtvD6W9167GIkeZns_JUH8SK"> We have pointed out that the new man can become perfect in relation to his functions only through receiving the proper nourishment. This, however, is not a superficial matter. On the contrary, it is one of the deepest concepts in the whole book of Ephesians. In Christianity today the ministers, pastors, and preachers mainly teach the people and thereby build up a religion instead of the Body. Many of those among us who formerly were ministers or missionaries can testify of this. Because those in Christianity rely on doctrine, they mainly build up something else in place of the Body. The Body does not become functionally perfect through the teaching of doctrine. Actually, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89919" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">Ephesians 4</span>, a chapter that speaks of the perfecting of the new man through the growth of life, doctrine is depreciated. Paul says that when we are no longer children, we shall no longer be carried about by winds of doctrine. What is needed for the building up of the Body and for perfecting the new man functionally is the growth of life. This comes only through feeding. </p>

The gifts here do not refer to abilities for service, but to the gifted persons mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89921" data-verses="Ephesians 4:11">verse 11</span>—apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. After conquering them and rescuing them from Satan and death through His death and resurrection, Christ in His ascension makes rescued sinners such gifts with His resurrection life and gives them to His Body for its building up. Hence, the four kinds of gifted persons mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89922" data-verses="Ephesians 4:11">verse 11</span> are those who have been endued with a special gift. These gifted ones are given “for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89923" data-verses="Ephesians 4:12">v. 12</span>). The more the saints are perfected, the more they grow. Through growth their function comes forth, and they function according to the effectual working in their measure. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyFX20i1VOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi">THE ASCENDED CHRIST PRODUCING GIFTS</h2><p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyTfPtHUYr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> Let us consider in more detail how Christ gave the gifts to His Body. How are the believers constituted as gifts and presented to the Body? The case of the Apostle Paul is an excellent example. Paul was not perfected by attending a theological seminary. As we all know, when he was Saul of Tarsus, he was an extremely religious person. Having been born into Judaism and raised in it, he opposed Christ and persecuted the church. He had even been authorized by the high priest to go to Damascus for the purpose of arresting and imprisoning those who called on the name of the Lord Jesus. But when he was on the way, the Lord Jesus appeared to him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89924" data-verses="Galatians 1:13">Galatians 1:13</span> Paul said, “For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it.” Then Paul went on to say that “it pleased God...to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89925" data-verses="Galatians 1:15">Gal. 1:15a</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89926" data-verses="Galatians 1:16">16a</span>). God caused Christ to be wrought into Paul so that he could minister Him to others. In this way, Christ presented Paul as a gift to the Body. By this process Christ constitutes us into gifts that are given to the Body. Firstly, Christ is wrought into us to become our life, our person, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="771" id="771">[771]</span> our everything. Then we minister to others the very Christ who has been wrought into us. </p>

In order for the new man to grow, we need to experience the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and descending Christ. This means that the all-inclusive Christ must be wrought into us to be our everything. Then the organically perfect new man will also become perfect functionally. </p>

Teaching may actually be a frustration to our growth in life. Before the new man could be created, all the ordinances had to be abolished. Now for the new man to grow, we must be careful about doctrine. Ordinances are obstacles to the formation of the new man, and doctrines are frustrations to the growth of the new man. I hope that all those who take the lead in the local churches will realize that we should not place our trust in doctrine to produce growth in the saints. Growth only comes through the experience of Christ. The degree to which we can minister Christ is in direct proportion to our experience of Christ. The more we experience Him, the more we can minister Him to others. As we minister Christ, others will be nourished. </p>
<p data-content-id="NAWg32TNbT8hiSFE9luPpyFX30iQXOvYNW38EYvaWCthK7UVb1afaRWXuuzzHFxdi"> The very Christ who was crucified and resurrected and who has ascended to the third heaven is now working within us to constitute us into functioning members of the Body. He carries out this work by making His home in our hearts and by saturating us with Himself. As He saturates us, we are <span class="pg" data-page-id="776" id="776">[776]</span> sanctified, purified, nourished, cherished, and transformed. The result is that we become perfected functionally. In this way the Body grows and builds itself up. The Body is not built directly by the Head or by the gifts mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89933" data-verses="Ephesians 4:11">4:11</span>; it is built up directly by those members who have been perfected by the gifted ones. </p>
<p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyTfOtH1br2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> Concerning this crucial matter, I pray that we all shall have a clear sky. I can testify that the sky above me is crystal clear regarding the growth of the new man. In these days may the Lord make all His faithful seeking ones transparently clear about the one new man. How blessed we are to be living at a time when the Lord is recovering these things! <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89934" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">Ephesians 4</span> has never been as clear to us as it is in these days. </p>
<p data-content-id="uRn6e8DCDhYvxWArZZyg1AApQPaevbWQ-S4ajELiYI6nagGr9Sjsomhlk1pMnAffa"> All those who desire to migrate for the spread of the church life must realize that migration is not a movement. It is the move of the one new man, that is, the move of the all-inclusive Christ in His Body. It is the move of Christ, the heavenly Solomon, in His palanquin. If the Lord is to move among us in such a way, we should not function in an individualistic way. Rather, we should function in the Body in the way of coordination. In order to function in this way, we need to experience Christ and to grow in Him. The measure of our growth will be the sphere, the realm, of our function. If we fail to function, there will be a gap in the Body. But if we function excessively, we shall cause a cancer in the Body. As the Head of the Body, Christ thoroughly knows the situation of the Body. According to His mercy, may the Body be preserved both from any shortage and from cancer caused by overfunction. </p>
<p data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4agysKx5XOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1"> We praise the Lord for opening His Word to us. We thank Him for showing us that the vital need is for Christ to be wrought into our being. The more we are saturated with Christ, the more we become in reality parts of the Body with a particular measure of function. Then wherever we may be we shall function properly, and the Body will grow. This will cause Satan, the enemy of God, to tremble. It will also hasten the coming back of the Lord Jesus. <span class="pg" data-page-id="777" id="777">[777]</span> </p>

If we fail to do this, we shall wrongly apply many things in this book. As we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89935" data-verses="Ephesians 4:17-32">4:17-32</span>, we should apply these verses corporately, not individualistically. These verses are not written in relation to the lives of individuals, but in relation to the corporate life of the one new man. The new man must become our daily living. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89936" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">verse 24</span> Paul speaks of putting on the new man. To put on the new man means to have the church life, which is the new life of the new mankind created by Christ in Himself. The church is a new humanity. Corporately we need to put on another humanity. It is crucial for us to have this view as we consider the second half of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89937" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">Ephesians 4</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="XN29daXoEaiDc-NwR9H8WYCfKCQLWqlHCNZd9RwShWBkL98XRz-1aU8fWCfEcI9un"> To put off the old man is not merely to put off the old nature; it is to put off the old way of life, the former way of living. Our old way of living was not entirely an individualistic way of life, for it involved our social life, our community life. No human being can be altogether individualistic. Human nature is inherently social. To be a human being is to live in society and to have some kind of community life. </p>
<p data-content-id="kW37bRWd4n3ChsU9j6t193oicSZGWNT7Km646Yo-l1oZoLWUehit8wxR0xamoxSLO"> In the church we have the best community life. If there were no church meetings, we would feel aimless, and our existence would be meaningless. We enjoy coming together in the meetings. The fact that the saints often linger after the meetings are dismissed indicates that in the church we have a genuine community life. If we would be the one new man, we must put off the community life of the old man and put on the community life of the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jf0PJ3Yzh-Zban-Z3PEii4PvhX0G16DqyCleWzpwECAyBCCrwndk4EBUpamTJ1Vjs"> Visiting Chinatown is part of Chinese social life in America. It is part of the living of the old man that must be put off if we are to practice the church life as the one new man. Many of those who go to Chinatown may discover that they have a difficult time praying after they come home. The reason for this is that, while they were in Chinatown, they <span class="pg" data-page-id="778" id="778">[778]</span> were walking according to the vanity of the mind instead of being renewed in the spirit of the mind. </p>
<p data-content-id="ziHhFbwj9qduVCwT62zA_ZSSlUWFPVUD31ttVpb1c14zDjDyuEyTtvwQz3ufe66GN"> For the sisters to put off the old man in a practical way, they need to put off their old way of shopping. I believe that most sisters find it difficult to pray when they are in a department store because their way of shopping is according to the living of the old man. It seems that the old man who was buried in baptism is resuscitated in the department store. We need to keep the old man in the tomb in a practical way. </p>
<p data-content-id="a-sefdyyFRnPSiT6ZZ18VpqBkG9JYTLq-KbZep_8kFXpjCLum-lwALY397Cqj_hpR"> Sometimes in the church life those of a certain nationality may cluster together and converse in their native language instead of English. This practice shows that it is not easy to put off the old man. We automatically prefer our old community life. The reason today’s Christianity is so weak is that it is permeated with the old man and his community life. In the denominations it is very difficult to see anything of the one new man. In the church life in the Lord’s recovery, we should no longer live according to the former conduct of the old man. We need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind and put on the one new man. </p>

They walk without God in the vanity of their mind, controlled and directed by their vain thoughts. Whatever they do according to their fallen mind is vanity. Hence, the basic element in the daily life of fallen mankind is the vanity of the mind. </p>

Mankind has fallen from the spirit into the mind. God purposely created man with a spirit with the intention that man would live and walk in the spirit. But through the fall man’s spirit was deadened, and man began to live according to the vanity of the mind. Those who are fallen have all their living directed by their thoughts. Every fallen person without exception is under the dominion of his thoughts. Before we were saved, our words and deeds were according to the thoughts of the fallen mentality. </p>

This is the key to the daily living of the corporate one new man. Formerly, our mind was filled with vanity; now it must be permeated with the spirit. We need to walk according to the spirit that is spreading into our mind <span class="pg" data-page-id="784" id="784">[784]</span> and filling it.

Such a spirit is given to us by God so that we may have wisdom and revelation to know Him and to know His economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="tzwripVs9Fk3nipcUmf3iyTfJtHUQr2jb0_NeYD53BK8Mn3pxx9JLnpB_OV9bI4OR"> In relation to the church, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation. As far as the church is concerned, a naturally keen mind is of no avail. Rather, the spirit is of primary importance. Just as we must use the proper organs to see, hear, and taste, so we must use the proper organ—the spirit—in dealing with the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="hECy9jMW8P0mGkxBZnlZn8ryFawMWiDgmVRllwkmTBLSWu1Pa4NnBlZGZMvZwIX2n"> Furthermore, our spirit must be a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Wisdom is in our spirit so that we may know the mystery of God, whereas revelation is of God’s Spirit to show us the vision by opening the veil. We firstly have wisdom, the ability to understand, that we may know spiritual things. Then the Spirit of God reveals the spiritual things to our spiritual understanding. Knowing that the spirit is of crucial importance in relation to the church, Paul prayed that the Father of glory would grant us such a spirit of wisdom and revelation. </p>

The natural mind is of no use in the church life as the <span class="pg" data-page-id="785" id="785">[785]</span> one new man. In school or in business we need to rely on our mind, but in the church we must depend on the spirit, realizing that in the natural mind there is nothing but vanity. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89962" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">2:22</span>, God’s dwelling place among His people today is in their spirit, not in their mind. </p>

Thus it can be regarded as the mingled spirit, the human spirit mingled with God’s Spirit. Such a mingled spirit was the means by which the New Testament revelation concerning Christ and the church was made known to the apostles and prophets. We need the same spirit to see such a revelation today. </p>
<p data-content-id="97aErHF-SEJpryBns_kx6bD7uOVJa0Sm_5Ip01psIOA-B9tjBYRX8YCfLQQpezm8D"> The “sons of men” in this verse are represented by the “holy apostles and prophets.” When God revealed the mystery of Christ to these representatives of mankind, He revealed it to their spirit.

In order to experience Christ as the embodiment of God, we need to be strengthened into our inner man. However, by nature the brothers are strong in the mind and in the will, whereas the sisters are strong in the emotion. May the Lord cause us to become strong in the spirit, in our inner man! </p>

Our heart is composed of all the parts of the soul—the mind, <span class="pg" data-page-id="786" id="786">[786]</span> emotion, and will—plus the conscience, the main part of our spirit. These are the inward parts of our being. Through regeneration, Christ came into our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89965" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">2 Tim. 4:22</span>). Subsequently, we should allow Him to spread Himself into every part of our heart. Since our heart is the totality of all our inward parts and the center of our inward being, when Christ makes His home in our heart, He is able to control our entire inner being and supplies and strengthens every inward part with Himself. The secret of Christ making His home in our heart is the strengthening of our inner man. Because Paul knew this secret, he prayed that the Father would grant us, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power into the inner man. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89967" data-verses="Ephesians 4:23">4:23</span> Paul says, “And are renewed in the spirit of your mind.” Once again, the spirit here is the regenerated spirit of the believers mingled with the indwelling Spirit of God. Such a mingled spirit spreads into our mind and thereby becomes the spirit of our mind. It is in such a spirit that we are renewed for our transformation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="89968" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Rom. 12:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89969" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Cor. 3:18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="sjXkE4SacWCMURuMJRaCvAzKpTlVjH-YgraOb5DHBza4oHIuMMtOObdt1QXES5cS9"> Our strengthened spirit is the means for our entire being to be renewed.

<p data-content-id="ZF7iQ7T0lQJP8gtIC7nMKHRWgLdlMgK5Boj8tqPtmmD8KvxV6FuuLU1d_HGholgwP"> In previous messages we have considered three categories of negative things that damage the church life: ordinances, doctrine, and the old man. Now we come to the fourth category of these negative things—the spots and wrinkles. Paul refers to this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89998" data-verses="Ephesians 5:27">5:27</span>, where he says that Christ will “present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things.” </p>
<p data-content-id="AXnZhT2yCTda2tSsLtpt53OsmZSC52SRKjJj-NlDFsVCsBmXLzJUkbhj6xh73wucH"> In Ephesians Paul deals with the four categories of negative things in a very good sequence. Related to the creation of the new man, we have the ordinances. Related to the growth of the new man for function, we have doctrine. Furthermore, related to the daily living of the new man, we have the old man with his old way of life. For the creation of the new man, the ordinances must be abolished and slain. For the growth of the new man, doctrine must be depreciated. For the proper daily living of the new man, the old man must be put off. However, after these three categories of negative things have been dealt with, we must still face the problem of the spots and wrinkles. </p>
<p data-content-id="FaCnJpVINrNNZOeFdLyT2et0dK1SmgmPMvZWA8JdRqSyRs1Anu0R3tM971rDnOAeg"> Because they are so subjective, the spots and wrinkles are more difficult to deal with than the ordinances, the doctrines, and the old man. We cannot simply abolish the spots and wrinkles or put them off, for they are in our organic tissue and natural makeup. Spots are of the natural life, and wrinkles are a matter of oldness. Humanly speaking, there is no way for us to remove such things. However, God has a way. <span class="pg" data-page-id="796" id="796">[796]</span> The water of life in the Word can metabolically wash away these defects by the transformation of life. The more Christ sanctifies the church and cleanses her through the washing of the water in the Word, the fewer spots and wrinkles there will be. Furthermore, as Christ nourishes and cherishes the church, the spots and wrinkles will be removed metabolically. Every flaw, defect, and imperfection will be removed by Christ’s transforming life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CS77-CD_jDbVS_AmpRDeyiELor6Ct8PJ9JKZxfZkyLszUQkkUllCISRdk2wqXjZND">IMPARTING THE RICH ELEMENT OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="a-sefdyyFRnPSiT6ZZ18VpqBiG9JQTLq-KbZep_8kFXpjCLum-lwALY397Cqj_hpR"> Instead of trying to correct others or to adjust them outwardly, we need to minister to them the sanctifying, purifying, nourishing, and cherishing element of Christ. This element will produce an inward change that will take away the oldness and the defects. We should not rely on any method or way. If a particular way is prevailing, it is not because of the way itself, but because of the life contained in that way and released by it. What we should impart to others is not a method or way of doing things; we should impart the rich element of Christ that will sanctify, purify, nourish, and cherish them. If you contact Christians whose way of meeting is different from yours, do not try to change them. Instead, take the opportunity to minister the riches of Christ to them. We should not care for a way, a method, or a form. We should care only to release the riches of Christ and to impart them to others. It is Christ who sanctifies and cleanses. Through His transforming work, all the spots and wrinkles are removed and replaced by His living element. </p>

They have been interwoven into our organic tissue. Therefore, only the inner supply of life can deal with them. If we want the spots and wrinkles to <span class="pg" data-page-id="797" id="797">[797]</span> be removed, then we must rely only on the sanctifying, purifying, nourishing, and cherishing element of Christ. It is not as difficult to deal with ordinances as it is with doctrines; doctrine is not as difficult to deal with as the old man; and the old man is not as difficult to deal with as the spots and wrinkles. Even though we may have no problems with ordinances, doctrine, or the old man, we must still inquire whether or not we are troubled by spots and wrinkles. </p>
<p data-content-id="yso9Pxvovo30rgMfTrxdwDtsSBNZgZ3STh7ddBjVVV-UFyNUyESGMFZxFx7YtQwo0"> The spots and wrinkles must be removed in order for the Bride to be prepared for Christ. To be sure, the Bride presented to Christ will not have any spots or wrinkles. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="89999" data-verses="Revelation 19:7">Revelation 19:7</span> says, “Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready.” Certainly the wife by this time will have been purified from all the spots and wrinkles. </p>
<p data-content-id="8h6Q8qq7fu5OpgOocEN7Cqtrsk5Cb-y1o55tduWJ4FjR4dq0idwixNOYWvRUriXAE"> We should not place our trust in mere outward change. Such change can take place suddenly without having any effect on the spots and wrinkles in our being. God’s concern is not that we simply change with respect to our outward appearance; His concern is that the spots and wrinkles be washed away by the sanctifying element of Christ. Only through such a process of sanctification can we become a beautiful and glorious Bride for Christ, a Bride without blemish or imperfection. We should forget about trying to improve ourselves and concentrate instead on experiencing the sanctifying riches of Christ. We all need more experience of the purifying element of Christ. The more we experience this element, the more our defects and shortcomings will be metabolically removed. As the result of this process, we shall become a beautiful Bride ready to be presented to Christ. Only by the supply of life from Christ can our natural defects and organic blemishes be removed. </p>
<p data-content-id="0naTN1RCJkMG7PW8mIxmjUm-1oJQzXNqd2rCBPzXqmX45pwCUIWXoXdNhMLiIbML0"> If we are clear about this, we shall realize that mere teachings can do nothing to eliminate spots and wrinkles. To repeat, only the sanctifying element which comes through the nourishing and cherishing of Christ can deal with such things. Praise the Lord that the element of Christ is gradually eliminating our defects! <span class="pg" data-page-id="798" id="798">[798]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7_JcBoLt_f4p4TwS9GhdcDPOd4eON0dHgTG9jncdwDuWZJuJ-gcIVOYb7Z2qhulnR">THE PREPARATION OF THE BRIDE</h2><p data-content-id="_gz5R_nH5oLy8-la4zwars7NSBAIdijurKKMBUDGJR9KRsTuy0qXMYueEupKE4DZW"> I believe that we are living in a day in which the Lord is preparing His Bride. Furthermore, I have the full assurance that we are presently undergoing this process of preparation. Otherwise, when, where, and with whom will <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90000" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19</span> have its fulfillment? This chapter is in the process of being fulfilled among us in the Lord’s recovery. </p>
<p data-content-id="B77vULL4YXIHFFm6havIcY9FRVNW4oUVhHMvf-EO7Y7mN_8U3mz_Sb5pyhxZje63p"> We need to connect <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90001" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19</span> with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90002" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span>. Apart from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90003" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span>, there is no way for the Bride to be prepared, and hence no way for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90004" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19</span> to be fulfilled. It is very significant that the Lord has spoken to us about ordinances, doctrines, the old man, and the spots and wrinkles. It is crucial that we experience the nourishing, cherishing, sanctifying, and purifying riches of Christ to remove our oldness and defects. When all such things have been removed, we shall become a church that is holy, glorious, and without blemish. Then we shall be the Bride in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90005" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19</span>. When the Bride has been prepared, Christ will come as the Bridegroom. Praise the Lord that we are in the process of becoming a holy and glorious Bride for Christ! How we praise the Lord for showing us the way to be prepared as the Bride, made ready for His coming back! Christ will have a church without ordinances, doctrines, the old man, and the spots and wrinkles. Such a church will be the beautiful Bride to satisfy the desire of His heart. </p>

Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90008" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span> we have the growth of this new man for functioning. Also in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90009" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span> we see the daily life of the new man. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90010" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">chapter five</span> we come to the presentation of the church to Christ. At the time of this presentation, the church will be the Bride, not the new man. As the new man, the church needs the functions. But as the Bride, the church needs beauty. The growth in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90011" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span> is for the function of the new man, whereas the beauty in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90012" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">chapter five</span> is for the presentation of the Bride. <span class="pg" data-page-id="799" id="799">[799]</span> </p>

The positive things unfolded in these chapters are far beyond our ability to grasp or apprehend. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90034" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">1:10</span>, Paul says, “Unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.” I do not think that very many Christians have an adequate understanding of this verse. This word does not refer to the preeminence of Christ, to the authority of Christ, or to the expression of Christ. This verse is unique, and no other verse in the Scriptures can be compared to it. When we read about husbands loving their wives or about wives submitting to their husbands, we readily understand, for such things as love and submission fit into our natural concept. But in order to grasp the meaning of verses such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90035" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">1:10</span>, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="uRn6e8DCDhYvxWArZZyg1AApVPaDlbWQ-S4ajELiYI6nagGr9Sjsomhlk1pMnAffa">GOD’S ETERNAL ADMINISTRATION</h2><p data-content-id="f7b2FFAU07LD9V7Buz2K4agypKxgcOZU_bqJDavbyXuhtjaZ60gaTlReWPsdKDOe1"> As we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90036" data-verses="Ephesians 1:9-10">1:9 and 10</span>, we see that the economy or dispensation which God purposed in Himself is to head up all things in Christ at the fullness of the times. The times refer to the ages. The fullness of the times will be when the new heaven and new earth come, after all the dispensations of God in all the ages have been completed. When God’s economy has been completed, Christ will head up all things universally. God has made Christ the Head over all things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90037" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22">1:22</span>). Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and <span class="pg" data-page-id="806" id="806">[806]</span> the new earth. This will be God’s eternal administration and economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="IYKcWTBZD2wraBqVv8VOsOtrbdn8Iu5Z92lk4lPzJmdAd2biN-nCndK5RLnSYtepK"> Because our physical body has a head, it is possible for our body to stand upright. Although we stand on our feet, it is actually the head which enables us to stand erect. This indicates that our head causes our entire body to be headed up. If a person has his head cut off, his body will collapse. Because the head causes every part of the body to be headed up, all the things that are on the body—clothing, shoes, eyeglasses—are headed up also. </p>
<p data-content-id="HfUkPNVdvPc-TGtNi_PIz-vU01zLd3n27HnTj40Roiaxg_VGkAzUncYLNZiT2Ke0a"> The entire universe is under Christ’s heading up. However, some things are still in a state of collapse because the process of the heading up of all things in Christ has not yet been completed. At the economy of the fullness of times, everything will be headed up in Christ. Nothing will continue to be in a state of collapse, and nothing will fall. In Christ God will head up all things. At present many things in the universe are still falling or collapsing. But at the dispensation of the fullness of the times, nothing will fall. Not even a leaf will fall from a tree. </p>

In the same principle, God is using Christ to head up all things in the universe. As the universal Head of all things, Christ needs a Body. This Body is the church. Just as clothing and other items rest on a person’s body, so one day everything in the universe will rest on Christ’s Body, the church. We have seen that if a person has his head cut off, his body and everything on it will collapse. The principle is the same with Christ as the Head over all things to the church. If all the things in the universe are not headed up in Christ through His Body, they will remain in a state of collapse. </p>
<p data-content-id="TS0vLm3wTVrzuTUulNHSpsNuwUDS2c-25mTg4xYz74KQnIYS77RmuCw_eSmkzr8AS"> Scientists have their explanations for such phenomena as the falling of leaves from trees. They put forth their reasons for the various physical changes that take place in the universe. These scientific explanations and reasons may be <span class="pg" data-page-id="807" id="807">[807]</span> correct temporarily, but they will not be correct eternally. I do not know physics or biology, but I do know the process of the divine heading up of all things. Furthermore, I believe <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90038" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">1:10</span> when it says that in the dispensation of the fullness of times this process will reach its completion. From that time onward, nothing in the universe will collapse. Everything will rest on the church as the Body of Christ. Christ is the Head, and the church is the Body. Christ is heading up the Body, and all the billions of items in the universe will rest on this headed-up Body. Although we do not see a full picture of this today, we do see it in miniature. We also can enjoy a foretaste of the heading up of all things in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="nFupmXdU7v_F8Wz3VyT4gw6JJecWDqgfhZHMQs6SxdJFG3VrWN2G3kyhCMk9WVErP"> We should not think that a person can stand upright mainly because his legs, ankles, and feet are strong. We have pointed out that it is actually the head that enables us to stand erect. Apart from the heading up of the body by the head, the body and everything on it will fall down. This is a picture of the heading up of all things in Christ. Firstly, Christ heads up His Body. Then in the dispensation of the fullness of the times, God will head up all things in Christ through the Body. </p>

The words, “in Whom” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90042" data-verses="Ephesians 1:11">verse 11</span> refer to Christ as the Head. In Him, the universal Head, we were made God’s inheritance. The Greek verb translated “were made an inheritance” means to choose or assign by lot. Hence, this clause literally means we were designated as a heritage. We were made an inheritance to inherit God’s inheritance. On the one hand, we were made God’s inheritance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90043" data-verses="Ephesians 1:18">v. 18</span>) for God’s enjoyment; <span class="pg" data-page-id="808" id="808">[808]</span> on the other hand, we were made to inherit God as our inheritance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90044" data-verses="Ephesians 1:14">v. 14</span>) for our enjoyment. </p>

This Spirit is the pledge, foretaste, guarantee, token payment, a part payment in advance. Since we are God’s inheritance, the Holy Spirit is a seal upon us. Since God is our inheritance, the Holy Spirit is the pledge of this inheritance to us. God gives His Holy Spirit to us, not only as a guarantee of our inheritance, securing our heritage, but also as a foretaste of what we shall inherit of God, affording us a taste beforehand of the full inheritance. </p>

We have seen that in Christ God is in the process of heading up all things in heaven and on earth. However, without the church as the Body to match Christ as the Head, it will not be possible for God to head up all things in Christ. The heading up of all things is accomplished by the Head, but it cannot be accomplished without a Body for the Head. This Body is God’s inheritance, God’s possession. Because we were lost, we had to be redeemed, purchased back, by God. Through redemption we have become God’s acquired possession. We, God’s redeemed ones, the church, are God’s possession, acquired by His purchase with the precious blood of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90049" data-verses="Acts 20:28">Acts 20:28</span>). In God’s economy, God becomes our inheritance, and we become God’s possession. As God’s inheritance and possession, we are the Body of Christ, through which all things in the universe are being headed up in Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="809" id="809">[809]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="qrCoreirL3MU0e6xc6vji8P5uGrVnz5zIOcWFV4v-HiHK0TVU2I9mwTIzwi4vYBpQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90054" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span> we have a general view of what the church is and how the church comes into being. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90055" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">chapter two</span> we see that the church is the new man created by Christ in Himself. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90056" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">chapter three</span> we have a clear vision of Christ making His home in the hearts of those in the church. For Christ to make His home in the heart of the church means that He is transfused into the center of the church’s inner being. Through such a transfusion, the church is filled unto all the fullness of God. In this way the church is mingled with divinity and saturated with it. Therefore, the church is humanity mingled, saturated, and permeated with divinity. </p>
<p data-content-id="yso9Pxvovo30rgMfTrxdwDtsQBNApZ3STh7ddBjVVV-UFyNUyESGMFZxFx7YtQwo0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90057" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">chapter four</span> we see the church as the new man. The new man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90058" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">chapter two</span> is organically complete, but not functionally perfect. In order to be functionally perfect, the church as the new man must grow in life. The more the new man grows, the more he will be able to function. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90059" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">Ephesians 4</span> we also see the daily walk of the new man. As we have pointed out, fallen mankind walks according to the vanity of the mind, but the walk of the church as the new man is in the spirit of the mind. </p>
<p data-content-id="8h6Q8qq7fu5OpgOocEN7Cqtruk5nV-y1o55tduWJ4FjR4dq0idwixNOYWvRUriXAE"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90060" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span> we see another aspect of the church—the church as the Bride prepared for Christ. In one sense, the church is the new man who needs growth, function, and a proper daily living. In another sense, the church is the Bride who must be beautified in order to be presented to Christ at His coming. With the church as the Bride, the problem is not with ordinances, doctrine, or the old man. <span class="pg" data-page-id="814" id="814">[814]</span> The problem is with the spots and wrinkles, defects that are organic and that ruin the beauty of the church. In order to be free from such defects, the church must be sanctified, purified, nourished, and cherished by having the element of Christ wrought into her metabolically. This element will cause the spots and wrinkles to disappear, and it will beautify the Bride for her presentation to Christ. Eventually, through this process of metabolic transformation the church will become glorious. </p>

In this chapter the church is not the Body, the building, the family, the kingdom, the new man, or the Bride. Here the church is God’s warrior. The church should be not only the Body to express Christ, the dwelling place for God’s habitation, and the new man for the fulfillment of God’s economy; the church must also be a warrior, a soldier, to defeat God’s enemy. </p>
<p data-content-id="xOItbD1M_SnXcAkcMHRO0aDhrC_nCBIPiZ8yi6s5e1DrTLjV78UWPV1TgR921-jvh"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90062" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19</span>, the church is both the Bride who is presented to Christ and the warrior who fights with Him against God’s enemy. At His coming again, the Lord Jesus firstly will meet His Bride. After receiving the Bride, Christ and the overcomers will enter into battle against the enemy. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90063" data-verses="Revelation 19:11">Revelation 19:11</span>, the Lord will ride on a white horse, and the armies which are in heaven will follow Him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and pure (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90064" data-verses="Revelation 19:14">v. 14</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90065" data-verses="Revelation 17:14">Revelation 17:14</span> also refers to this: “These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and they who are with Him are called and chosen and faithful.” </p>
<p data-content-id="rzBtTvnnp8EWQ9SXyt4WJFpmLK0wYN18pC-iFM-wWF7biwez5fLvQHeKFo4_b1dI7"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90066" data-verses="Revelation 19:7-8">Revelation 19:7 and 8</span> we see that the Bride is clothed in “fine linen, bright and pure.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90067" data-verses="Revelation 19:14">verse 14</span> we see that the armies which follow the Lord into battle are “dressed in fine linen, white and pure.” These verses indicate that the Bride’s wedding garment will also be the uniform she wears as God’s army to fight against His enemy. Therefore, to have the wedding garment is also to have the uniform. <span class="pg" data-page-id="815" id="815">[815]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="dvx25G8sssSYMALmWN9v-wwjE3yApwN7G3_YIZuDLoUsHACVRNy6oYa6xgCQFEpxU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90068" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1-2">Ephesians 5 and 6</span> we see the church as the Bride and as the warrior. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90069" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19</span> we also have these two aspects of the church. As the church, we are not only the Body, the dwelling place of God, the kingdom of God, the family of God, and the new man; we are also the Bride and the warrior. As the Bride, we must be beautiful, without spot or wrinkle, and be clothed in fine linen. As the warrior, we must be equipped to fight against God’s enemy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Qx8ifoJKSBOSARypN07r-S9vvVFU7TTyZhsH6nSKjrLvfHEslbubxk7ArhRRfJJZk">SPIRITUAL WARFARE—A MATTER OF THE BODY</h2><p data-content-id="KinSpiWncXMNo5T64K5GnF2HkvJMOAmz0SWiBllAApDxAJJy3NRnyUU_zHhMXOBI9"> In God’s economy there is one army constituted of a corporate warrior. This means that the warrior in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90070" data-verses="Ephesians 6:1">Ephesians 6</span> is a corporate entity. Only as a corporate entity, the Body, can we put on the whole armor of God. This is contrary to the concept held by many Christians that an individual believer is able to wear the entire armor. The armor in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90071" data-verses="Ephesians 6:1">Ephesians 6</span> is not for Christians as individuals; it is for the church corporately as the Body. What this chapter reveals is not the believers fighting as individuals, but a corporate army fighting the battle for God’s interests on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="lwsB7fTo0YBNqEyc92s8YZt9duR5l2669bSShh3cXlYnPCMXGJH6EofNa-wN0fGTI"> Spiritual warfare is not an individual matter; it is a matter of the Body, a corporate entity to fight the battle against God’s enemy. No soldier in a modern army would enter into battle by himself. Rather, he would fight as part of a well-trained and fully equipped army. After we have been formed corporately into an army, we shall be able to fight against God’s enemy. God’s strategy is to use the church as His army to fight against the enemy. Therefore, it is very dangerous to be isolated from the army. Only by remaining in the army will we have the necessary protection. </p>
<p data-content-id="ORuveXsLSL_KAUQRmmsRwUALhxfJksZhadewDeZFVr0RNBcjRKpEUgJ7ZofkxfD26"> Years ago, the Lord’s people regarded spiritual warfare as an individual matter. But through the years we have seen that it is altogether a matter of the church as God’s corporate army. If you separate yourself from the church, you will be defeated. Satan’s strategy is simply to isolate you from the church as God’s army. It is crucial for us to realize that spiritual warfare is a Body matter. If we realize this and stay with the church, we shall be victorious. The battle is not <span class="pg" data-page-id="816" id="816">[816]</span> for us as individual believers; it is for the church as God’s army. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="4hu3V9NSxOD4qIDQx-aI8ny7IXQAdHAukquOkznsExY9T1eCWD6YHuZmIvOhld_9j">EMPOWERED IN THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="od6p5sc1GDqOFwWB01GI4UNVHvyh4TvvTOTFDcnJar4LT8Qnqe8UcaKDTX05Qn6K7"> As God’s warrior, the church does not fight by her own strength. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90072" data-verses="Ephesians 6:10">Ephesians 6:10</span> says, “For the rest, be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength.” This verse indicates clearly that we should not fight in our own strength. On the contrary, we must be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength. The Greek word rendered “empowered” has the same root as the word power in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90073" data-verses="Ephesians 1:19">1:19</span>. To deal with God’s enemy, to fight against the evil forces of darkness, we need to be empowered with the greatness of the power that raised up Christ from the dead and seated Him in the heavens, far above all the evil spirits in the air. In the spiritual warfare against Satan and his evil kingdom, we can fight only in the Lord, not in ourselves. Whenever we are in ourselves, we are defeated. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3GEuFAt2o9byg8MZDzK996m37fH7FXg_LkbTuP-LW2tuU3xrWTByUo7lMUOiCI2ZU">PUTTING ON CHRIST AS THE ARMOR</h2><p data-content-id="GJHsP88GHseo8rpjYyem_lGvVqQ544KrNMLYo1DtwblC8XXjSuatQl8WDTK_MeK3O"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90074" data-verses="Ephesians 6:1">Ephesians 6</span>, the Lord with His might is the very armor that we put on for our protection. This means that we, as the Body, need to put on Christ Himself as our armor. In order to fight in the spiritual warfare, we must have Christ as the whole armor of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="cUZm3R2OO3-xg87ohmxD-0kpfbXX-m8pa3KWJwuNiJOAyh8b5NcNgFoM_6ZG01679"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90075" data-verses="Ephesians 6:14-17">6:14-17</span> there are six aspects of Christ as armor: the girdle of truth, or reality; the breastplate of righteousness; the firm foundation of the gospel of peace (the shoes); the shield of faith; the helmet of salvation; and the sword of the Spirit. Therefore, the whole armor of God consists of the girdle, the breastplate, the shoes, the shield, the helmet, and the sword. The shield is for defense, whereas the sword is for offense. In fact, the sword is the only item of the armor that is for offensive warfare. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Y7KPbnfhmVACkNVkC3njcSpZ9kiJBRrpc5RUdAorxwk76X6_8r4-6ikKrq_X9AheN">APPLYING THE ARMOR BY PRAYER</h2><p data-content-id="EkaMV3Soowz1Y1LdwSAggrak_cx8q6M0H0MN5WrZ4ZYcDUwX2c921mm7c4iIL8IZY"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90076" data-verses="Ephesians 6:18">verse 18</span>, we receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit by means of all prayer and <span class="pg" data-page-id="817" id="817">[817]</span> petition. Actually, prayer is the means by which we receive all the aspects of the whole armor of God. Do you know how to apply the girdle of reality? It is by praying in spirit. Prayer is also the way to apply the breastplate, the shoes, the shield, the helmet, and the sword. </p>
