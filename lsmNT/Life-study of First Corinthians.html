<p data-content-id="XfZ84nrEImIc-Nz7b9qjdkNeXbVUzpA1vTstMBvDe1z-Kgbse9Vggac7oUtrY8Ta8"> The arrangement of the books of the Bible is truly sovereign of the Lord. For example, Revelation is not the first book, and Genesis is not the last. Even this one example proves that the arrangement of the books of the Bible is according to God’s sovereignty. </p>
<p data-content-id="k_DHJPbquZertxEnBc6g-ljfw4I_Y_ACnjVdHcB2ooYdTIhcWKx_8CTD37vjRHlBO"> In the New Testament the four Gospels provide a record of the life of the Lord Jesus and show how He accomplished redemption through His crucifixion. From the Gospels we also know of Christ’s resurrection and ascension. In the book of Acts we have the Lord’s move in the heavenlies and in resurrection through His Body on earth. In this book we have not only the acts of the apostles and disciples, but also the acts of the resurrected and ascended Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="JIZ-QykqNDG1BWmM2KnMOMhZju_iNYeGSjItV_PoJZcGOh57N2xS8o8hJ8R-wu70-"> After the book of Acts, we have the first of the New Testament Epistles—Romans. The book of Romans gives us a full and complete sketch of both the Christian life and the church life. In Romans we have not only the teachings concerning the Christian life and the church life, but also the principles. </p>
<p data-content-id="zjs7tyZL5uIfKl2-jisuY3zjK1KLXAhZDSOhXV4aRDYk9Z7bsjPuLM57LGu0lUUp1"> Immediately after Romans we have 1 Corinthians. First Corinthians gives us an illustration of the Christian life, the church life, and the Body life. Each of these lives is fully illustrated in 1 Corinthians. However, not many Christian teachers realize that what is revealed in Romans in the way of a sketch is fully illustrated in 1 Corinthians. To repeat, in Romans we have the sketch of the Christian life and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> church life, whereas in 1 Corinthians we have an illustration of the Christian life, the church life, and the Body life. </p>
<p data-content-id="rOrhtHgFLbPZdw3O4ue4E_N7etWmKRSVn6tw8A0d5A7IYnxmV72X7JLePRUU6vTBF"> A number of books on 1 Corinthians have been written by teachers among the Brethren and also by those in the Pentecostal or charismatic movement. Some of the Brethren teachers have said that 1 Corinthians was written to solve a number of serious problems in the church. Those from a Pentecostal or charismatic background may emphasize the so-called gifts in 1 Corinthians, especially tongues-speaking and healing. However, the book of 1 Corinthians is not mainly concerned with problems in the church or with spiritual gifts or miracles. Please be impressed with the fact that this book gives us an illustration of the Christian life, church life, and Body life. </p>
<p data-content-id="dRbM-RzPLsExpR48s2PLYESmm-66K_L4CLXbJG9LWljslgHPW3EQrzdq0rf_WG4mx"> Most readers of 1 Corinthians have a negative impression of the church in Corinth. Do you like this church? If you are truthful, you will admit that you do not appreciate this church. Many years ago, I did not care very much for the church in Corinth. But now I appreciate this local church. To me, the book of 1 Corinthians is very sweet and enjoyable. I enjoy this book not because it solves problems or deals with gifts, but because it illustrates the Christian life, the church life, and the Body life. </p>
<p data-content-id="QM-bErH4QMuLGtlKhNiUmVseR6-Mo4MAMYWMZ85bAWzUJ836Exkha9TFHxEakh9zT"> Some may argue with the assertion that 1 Corinthians is an illustration of our Christian life. They may ask, “Are we supposed to follow the Christians in Corinth? Are we to have the kind of Christian life described in this book? Are we to follow the example of the church in Corinth and have the kind of church life they had? Should we have the Body life like what we see in Corinth? Everything in the church in Corinth was pitiful. The Christian life, the church life, and the Body life all were pitiful.” However, whether or not the Corinthians were pitiful in these matters is secondary. The point here is that in a very real sense the Corinthians illustrate the usual, or typical, Christian life, church life, and Body life. Actually, the usual Christian life is just like that of the Corinthians. The same is true of the typical church life and Body life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="K9Fhzhq9ETFPCPzdkFWRrkfkDyu0qmgIrxy5sjP0zVrET7fYv2qxzXlZDmd0Kk9SX"> Consider your own Christian life, church life, and Body life. Is your Christian life better than that of the Corinthians? Is your church life and Body life superior to theirs? If you are honest, you will answer that you are not better than the Corinthians in these matters. </p>
<p data-content-id="ldCSVKCXVHzwbcJAktI5qY9WW0m-zAHEawBHCbCwzcGvha9kv82E6htYPVBgcHt9H"> Every local church is a Corinth. Do not boast of the church in your locality and think that it is special, superior to the church in Corinth. Do you have the confidence to say that your Christian life is better than that of the Corinthians, or that your church life and Body life are superior to theirs? Do not consider your local church better than the church in Corinth. The church life in Corinth is an accurate illustration of the church in every locality. </p>
<p data-content-id="OT5FVjm4b3rEEp9If2G1UsfkTjficISBJnAujJTvH9vLo8q-qnrQL8cvvI2WkbUHd"> What about your experience of the Body life? Some may appreciate the Body life in a certain place and feel that it is wonderful. But is the Body life there better than what is illustrated in the book of 1 Corinthians? Certainly not. In our fiber, in our makeup, we all are the same as the believers at Corinth. It was certainly according to the wisdom of God to use the church in Corinth as a complete illustration of the Christian life, church life, and Body life found in every locality. </p>
<p data-content-id="45d-EDyyRdejyAtIco9vv--MfBFfH5nEY2ywQ__J1z9MAZSXg-0MsBpqMhRa6rO3L"> We have pointed out that certain Bible teachers, especially those among the Brethren, say that 1 Corinthians deals with serious problems in the church. The book of 1 Corinthians does in fact cover many problems. The first of these problems is the problem of division. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81172" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:11-12">1:11 and 12</span> Paul says, “For it was made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of the household of Chloe, that there are strifes among you. Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.” Just as there were divisions among the saints in Corinth, so there are divisions among believers in the churches today. What local church does not have any divisions? Do you have the assurance to say that there are no divisions in the church in your locality? By divisions I do not mean denominations; I mean the kind of divisions illustrated by the Corinthians, who said, “I am of Paul, and I of <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> Apollos.” It is common in a local church for brothers to say that they are for a certain thing or a certain person and for others to declare that they are for something else or someone else. This is what I mean by division. None of us dares to say that in our local church there is not this kind of division. </p>
<p data-content-id="oHvwn1F9kPbTytIPVynf_MGPeusawFjhRr5MyP7fRRrtjdCyM9IgKVBeI7sBRsMLT"> Often there is division even between a brother and his wife. As a brother and sister in Christ, they come together to the Lord’s table and partake of the one loaf. However, the sister may not be truly one with her husband. For example, she may speak to him in a divisive way, or inwardly find fault with him or disagree with him without saying anything. This is divisiveness. To be sure, none of us can say that there is no division in our church life or family life. In this we are the same as the church in Corinth. </p>
<p data-content-id="3E2ZRbJydxokD8WKMAIbtFfHb0jzb68DgKbropmbxR9wRW14_fX2fsKcexAdJrzWM"> I mention this matter of division not to show that 1 Corinthians is a book concerned with problems, but to emphasize the fact that it is a book illustrating the Christian life, the church life, and the Body life. This book is concerned with individual Christians, the church, and the Body. Hence, it illustrates three categories of spiritual life: the individual Christian life, the corporate church life, and the organic Body life. It is crucial that we have such a view when we read this book. Then we shall understand that it was written not to solve problems or to emphasize gifts, but to illustrate the practical and actual Christian life, church life, and Body life. </p>

<p data-content-id="_PQd6AGHMk6jAgPz44nxU9j8ur2zdeZu0_E2lElAEy7EqNuVxyNwhicQJPFxcqffg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81210" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">Verse 2</span> says, “To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints.” According to grammar, “to the church of God” is in apposition to “to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus.” This indicates that “to the church of God” equals “to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus.” This strongly indicates that the church is a composition of the saints, and the saints are the constituents of the church. The two should not be considered separate entities. Individually, we are the saints; corporately, we are the church. Thus, the church is not only constituted of God, but is also composed of the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="BlFnrZica4yWuQnA7t-H0gDU5fwQYidC2RRvOc3utg7GeZB2ROy6rbjikKwq_wK8F"> To be sanctified is to be made holy, separated unto God for the fulfillment of His purpose. Saints are separated ones, those who have been set apart to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="xedXR7KyftfYy5rRtYIjXLRf-xguDXvOqcsaAEtIn7rjMRQgLiFkUjZ1Br4qBKkUQ"> In this verse Paul says that we have been “sanctified in Christ Jesus.” We are sanctified in the element and sphere of Christ. Christ is the element and sphere that separated us, made us holy, unto God when we believed in Him, that is, when we were brought into an organic union with Him through our faith in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zjyvva9_mwbWU7v14CMragfkXMl76M85DIIYr3C2npxvRcj28K_niY4FY2FqTLVIx"> The expression “called saints” indicates that the believers in Christ are the called saints; they are not called <em>to be</em> saints (as in KJV). This is a positional matter, a sanctification in position with a view to sanctification in disposition. <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="A3Oa3UPcjrJzR4wlouzXCJftgWRSWHHN_J2G0osifE_yD30wsSCVCR1Rhevz1xRO7"> Many readers of 1 Corinthians find it difficult to recognize that the believers in Corinth were saints. To be sure, according to the Catholic definition, they were not saints. According to Catholicism, only certain persons, such as Theresa or Francis, can rightfully be called saints. We may wonder how the fleshly believers in Corinth could be called saints. Nevertheless, it is in the Word that Paul describes them as those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus and called saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="F_0pIc17fjqQrLFCajrHceBnEm3EkINB5oIu9NMW-twLqCp0pOLPqCxrSvbNiuAOt"> Do you have the boldness to say that you are holy? Some may reply, “I cannot argue with Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81211" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1 Corinthians 1:2</span>. According to this word, I have been sanctified. But still I don’t feel that I’m holy.” Concerning this, we should not look at ourselves. Paul does not say that the Corinthians were sanctified in themselves; he declares that they had been sanctified in Christ Jesus. We need to forget ourselves and see that it is in Christ that we are sanctified. </p>
<p data-content-id="CFF3xQmaFvwJ5j4xk2Wr_M9AHisFFvvZEwIjhulhhQwaE4qISeDhS6DHqSHn3a8XL"> Regarding the matter of being sanctified in Christ Jesus, a brother should not be influenced by any negative opinion his wife may have about him. Every brother is holy in the eyes of others, but not in the eyes of his wife. A wife always knows the weak points of her husband. She has a detailed knowledge of his shortcomings. This makes it difficult for any wife to admit that her husband is holy. But even if a brother is not sanctified in the eyes of his wife, he is nonetheless sanctified in Christ Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="PxQUR1aSfVg1g5EN0uN6GBmA7oa_DRqoGBY2oLF94p-AdYjLrSH1ujpvA-dj4BNGp"> God does not look at us as we are in ourselves; rather, He looks at us in Christ. This may be illustrated by the words the prophet Balaam uttered about the children of Israel. Apparently the children of Israel were full of evil. But when Balaam prophesied concerning them, he declared, “He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81212" data-verses="Numbers 23:21">Num. 23:21</span>). Likewise, Paul knew all the evil things about the church in Corinth. Nevertheless, in his opening word he addressed them as those sanctified in Christ Jesus, and he called them saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="-31E-FlFhHZVWfRVsibLPN9Po-xOz3xAxPJ5Vu-NyImqaLANCOsF5aHepDtdpWJmP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81213" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">verse 2</span> Paul says, by the use of another appositive, that those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus are <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> called saints. To us, this may seem repetitious. But without such repetition we may not receive a strong impression concerning the fact that the believers there in Corinth were truly saints, even called saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="prVBOIVQEyCQk7WbC65wKBFpZIyHUt92uJKJiha3N6sMf93hlzv0FeRHAEKBhJS-J"> Every saved one is a called one. To be called is to be saved. When the Lord Jesus said to Peter, “Follow Me,” that was His calling of Peter. We, the saved ones, have all been called. Once we were called, we became saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="vFgafReeId0NLp6vSzTQo14EsX_DOCFd3QfaNo4gGNBc9CrkwduxPEplaAWErKNdi"> Do not think that only persons such as Theresa or Francis should be called saints. You and I are saints also. Do you have the boldness to declare that you are a saint? Some of us may have the confidence only to say that we are believers, but not the assurance to say that we are saints. Some may say, “I am a sinner saved by grace, and I am a believer in Christ. But I dare not say that I am a saint.” The reason for this lack of assurance is that the evil influence from Catholicism still affects our understanding. Others, aware of failures like losing their temper or quarreling with their spouse, may not have the confidence to say that they are saints. But whether or not you are a saint does not depend on whether or not you lose your temper or quarrel. It depends on whether or not you have been called. </p>
<p data-content-id="WPLFJeiDr66zP26-znBSbuxrk_rGZbWa3gCyw_QagmclIUlGYx9j371es8KAwySLd"> Instead of saying “called saints,” the King James Version says “called to be saints.” According to this translation, being a saint is pending; it is not already an accomplished fact. But Paul did not say that we are called to be saints; he says that we are called saints. If we turn away from ourselves and look at Christ, we shall be able to declare that we are saints. We shall realize that a saint is simply a called one. </p>
<p data-content-id="2x5QcsCAgui9NXQYMVnCg51gf1NTLk96GxAmcxHan8nZifIVz9C609J7eMcjMZTbI"> To be called by God is to be separated unto Him. For example, those who have been called into military service have been separated from civilian life and drafted into the service. This illustrates God’s calling. When we were called by God, we were drafted, separated, by Him. As a result, we have been sanctified; that is, we have been separated unto a certain purpose. Because we all have been called by God unto His purpose, we are the called saints. <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> </p>

It also indicates that this Epistle was intended not only for the believers in that one church in Corinth, but for all believers in every place. First Corinthians is for all believers of whatever place or time. </p>
<p data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp7nvlYhwrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen"> If I had been writing this Epistle, I probably would have used the word and instead of with. Paul’s wording here is very important. As we have seen, it indicates that a local church includes only those in that particular locality, not all the saints on earth. Paul wrote this Epistle to the church in Corinth with all the saints on earth. Only the local saints are the components of a particular church. The saints in other localities are not components of that church. However, this greeting indicates that this book of illustrations was written not only to the saints at Corinth, but to all the saints, no matter where they may be. </p>
<p data-content-id="HGln5zZ0kg7BRF2G3k4ch5kayK9fIchfM5IVWj_WdxC7j7vo-3Hmf4N_nWwoJM4tK"> When referring to the local saints at Corinth, Paul uses the expression “called saints.” But when he speaks of all the saints on earth, he uses another description: “all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place.” In this verse we see two callings: first, we are called saints; second, we call upon the name of the Lord. This indicates that we, the believers, the saints, have been called by God to call upon the name of the Lord. We have been called to call! To be called is a matter once for all, but to call upon the name of the Lord is a lifelong matter. Continually we need to call on Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="XfZ84nrEImIc-Nz7b9qjdkNeXbVUzpA1vTctISPDe1z-Kgbse9Vggac7oUtrY8Ta8"> To call upon the name of the Lord implies to believe in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81215" data-verses="Romans 10:14">Rom. 10:14</span>).

<p data-content-id="45d-EDyyRdejyAtIco9vv--MfBFfH5nEY2SwXs_J1z9MAZSXg-0MsBpqMhRa6rO3L"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81257" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:6">1:6</span> Paul says, “Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you.” The testimony of Christ here is different from the testimony of Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81258" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1</span>. Here Paul means the preaching of Christ. Paul’s preaching of Christ was a testimony of Christ. Some may wonder why Paul did not use the word preaching, but instead spoke of a testimony. Preaching may be regarded simply as a matter of words conveying thoughts. A testimony is quite different from this. A testimony must be a living, not merely a preaching. </p>
<p data-content-id="oHvwn1F9kPbTytIPVynf_MGPeusawFjhRrZM0crfRRrtjdCyM9IgKVBeI7sBRsMLT"> Many of today’s Christian ministers only preach; they do not testify. In their preaching they express certain thoughts in words. However, they do not have a life to testify what they preach. </p>
<p data-content-id="3E2ZRbJydxokD8WKMAIbtFfHb0jzb68DgK7rh5GbxR9wRW14_fX2fsKcexAdJrzWM"> In order to help the Corinthians not only to understand his expression but also to have the reality, Paul told them that the testimony of Christ was confirmed in them. Here Paul seems to be saying, “I did much more than merely preach Christ to you. What I preached was my living. This is my testimony concerning Christ. You have been enriched in all expression and all knowledge. You have been enriched in the understanding of what I preached to you.” Paul’s preaching to the Corinthians was his testifying to them. </p>
<p data-content-id="GBDJJALJ0cF4ks8AH19ucJjnWsP4LTnCDAYKKonhfQlZ2XYUYk_NIq7g1JKhMOSI_"> Paul’s testimony of Christ was confirmed in, or among, the believers in Corinth. Paul was very careful in composing his Epistle. By saying that the testimony of Christ was confirmed in the Corinthians, Paul meant something like this: <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> “When I preached Christ to you, I testified to you of Christ. When you believed in Him and received Him, something happened in you. Eternal life was given to you, and the Holy Spirit came into you. These are the initial gifts which are in you. These initial gifts confirm what I testified to you.” </p>
<p data-content-id="3E2ZRbJydxokD8WKMAIbtFfHb0jzb68DgK7rormbxR9wRW14_fX2fsKcexAdJrzWM"> All the matters that Paul covers here are related to being saints. A saint is a person who has been called by God and who is now calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. A saint is also a person who has the confirmation within him. Do you not have within you the confirmation Paul speaks of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81259" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:6">verse 6</span>? As believers in Christ, you surely have the divine life and the Holy Spirit in you. Therefore, you are confirmed with respect to your salvation. If a person does not have this confirmation within him, I would have doubts about his salvation. A saint not only has been called by God and calls on the name of the Lord, but he also has a certain inner confirmation. Something within him confirms that he belongs to the Lord and that he has the divine life and the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="GBDJJALJ0cF4ks8AH19ucJjnWsP4LTnCDAYKC6XhfQlZ2XYUYk_NIq7g1JKhMOSI_"> Early in their Christian life, some saints may lose the feeling that they are saved. They may not feel that they have the divine life or the Holy Spirit. When I was young, I also sometimes lost this feeling. Not long after I was saved, I read John Bunyan’s book <em>Pilgrim’s Progress.</em> At one point, the pilgrim in that book loses his certificate. When I read this, I asked myself where my certificate was. It seemed that I was not able to find it. For several days I was troubled about this, and I was unable to eat well or sleep well. Then I read a book published by Brother Nee, <em>The Assurance of Salvation.</em> In this book Brother Nee says that in the Bible God clearly tells us that as long as we believe in Christ, we are saved. When I read this, I opened my Bible to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81260" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>, knelt down, and said, “I want to testify to the heavens and the earth that I believe this verse. According to this verse in the Bible, I know that I have eternal life.” Although I still had some doubts after that, eventually the strong feeling returned in me that I was in fact a child of God. This is what I mean by inward confirmation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="23" id="23">[23]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="c72SBDvLnZO0HTNpK_Y1vJj4uYnRW9aVyIWG7tuhmUkJUykeLnr0FNqIv6PWDSSzw"> As believers in Christ, we all have this confirmation. We are confirmed that we are children of God with the divine life and the Holy Spirit. As Paul says, we are not lacking in any gifts. We have seen that this means we possess the initial gifts—the divine life and the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="YAf-ThL_BpKj4Bal8Hh8S_ZBAgDwrplD8f-UCEM4sdE5fnGiiRPa9o6wxsU4R57wn"> Having considered the various matters related to being a saint, we all should be clear that we are truly saints. Can you deny the fact that you are a saint? You have been called by God, you are calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, and you have the inner confirmation that you possess the divine life and the Holy Spirit. </p>

Fellowship denotes the partaking of, the participation in, God’s Son. It is to partake of, participate in, the all-inclusive Christ. God has called us into such a fellowship that we may partake of Christ, participate in Him, and enjoy Him as our God-given portion. This word, like the word concerning Christ’s being theirs and ours in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81264" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">verse 2</span>, stresses again the crucial fact of Christ’s being the unique center of the believers for the solving of the problems among them, especially that of division. </p>
<p data-content-id="gtgtI35Vr92rZOQoDGIVGs8NRXsfme5u1Rd2yUglaZ2BEOI4Y3brU9LirmsGa_3J7"> This book unveils to us that the very Christ, who is the portion of all believers, and into whose fellowship we have been called, is all-inclusive.

He is the depths of God, the deep things of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81270" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:10">2:10</span>). He is the unique foundation of God’s building (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81271" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:11">3:11</span>). He is our Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81272" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:7">5:7</span>), the unleavened bread (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81273" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:8">5:8</span>), the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> the spiritual rock (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81274" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:3-4">10:3-4</span>). He is the Head (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81275" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:3">11:3</span>) and the Body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81276" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:12">12:12</span>). He is the firstfruit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81277" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:20">15:20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81278" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:23">23</span>), the second Man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81279" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:47">15:47</span>), and the last Adam (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81280" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">15:45</span>); as such, He became the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81281" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">15:45</span>). This all-inclusive One, with the riches of at least nineteen items, God has given to us as our portion for our enjoyment. We should concentrate on Him, not on any persons, things, or matters other than Him. We should focus on Him as our unique center appointed by God that all the problems among the believers may be solved. It is into the fellowship of such a One that we have been called by God. This fellowship of Him becomes the fellowship the apostles shared with the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81282" data-verses="Acts 2:42">Acts 2:42</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81283" data-verses="1John 1:3">1 John 1:3</span>) in His Body, the church, and should be the fellowship we enjoy in the partaking of His blood and His body at His table (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81284" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:16">10:16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81285" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:21">21</span>). Such a fellowship must be unique, because He is unique. It forbids any division among the members of His unique Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="eUZwTHuTDFPfNYOCu1n50UUorE6pAtRKJ_PM58aY_zFf532UtF6kNi_wohlwMw9hh"> This word fellowship is profound and very deep. I do not believe that any Christian teacher or expositor of the Bible can exhaust the meaning of this word. Fellowship does not merely mean that there is communication between you and someone else; it also denotes participation in that one. Furthermore, it means that we and Christ have become one. It also means that we enjoy Christ and all He is, and that He enjoys us and what we are. As a result, there is not only a mutual communication, but a mutuality in every way. All that Christ is becomes ours, and all that we are becomes His. We all have been called by God into such a mutuality between us and the Son of God. I do not believe that in any other language there is an adequate equivalent for the Greek word for fellowship. We have been called into the fellowship of God’s Son. We have been called into a mutuality in which we enjoy what the Son of God is, and in which we are one with Him and He is one with us. Elsewhere in this Epistle, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81286" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">6:17</span>, Paul says, “He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.” We have been called into such a oneness. In this oneness we enjoy what Christ is, and He enjoys what we are. <span class="pg" data-page-id="25" id="25">[25]</span> </p>

However, we should not understand this to mean that what we have in 1 Corinthians is an illustration of the proper or normal Christian life, church life, and Body life. Concerning these three kinds of lives, this Epistle illustrates what is actual or typical, not what is normal or proper. Thus, we should never make the mistake of saying that in 1 Corinthians we have the proper church life. What we see concerning the practice of the church life in this Epistle is neither proper nor normal. Rather, it is usual or typical. </p>

God’s intention is to make Christ His Son the center of His economy and also to make Him everything to all the believers. This is why Paul tells us in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81294" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">verse 9</span> that we have been called into the fellowship of the Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. It is also the reason he points out in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81295" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">verse 2</span> that Christ is both theirs and ours. In His economy God’s intention is to make Christ everything, to <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> give Christ to us as our portion, and also to work Christ into us. </p>
<p data-content-id="tiNQgxDpsd4NWazI4KY7Ls3Zc1jf31TN_mm0g0Zv7jbyJhqTUCAeHZ8B89sG6uKJy"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81296" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:10">verse 10</span> Paul begins to deal with the divisions among the Corinthians. First, he beseeches them through the name of our Lord, which is the name above all names (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81297" data-verses="Philippians 2:9">Phil. 2:9</span>) and should be the unique name among all His believers. However, by ranking the names of Paul, Apollos, and Cephas with the name of Christ, the divisive Corinthians made the same kind of mistake Peter did on the mount of transfiguration when he ranked Moses and Elijah with Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81298" data-verses="Matthew 17:1-8">Matt. 17:1-8</span>). To keep the oneness in the Lord and to avoid divisions, we need to uplift and exalt the unique name of our Lord by dropping all names other than this highest name. </p>
<p data-content-id="WPLFJeiDr66zP26-znBSbuxrk_rGZbWa3hiyw9QagmclIUlGYx9j371es8KAwySLd"> When the Corinthians believed in Christ, they did not receive anything from Paul, Apollos, or any other servant of God. No doubt, Paul and Apollos were a great help to the believers in Corinth. But the One received by them was Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81299" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:13">1:13</span> Paul asks them, “Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?” No, Paul was not crucified for them, and they were not baptized into Paul’s name. Christ was the One who was crucified for them, and the believers were baptized into the name of Christ. Here Paul seems to be saying, “Actually, you did not receive anything from Paul, Apollos, or Cephas. You should not even be limited to a narrow Christ. You must pay your full attention to the unique Christ. This Christ is not only yours and ours—He belongs to everyone. He is theirs and ours, for He is the portion of the saints in every place.

This matter is altogether wonderful. This fellowship involves not only the oneness between us and the Triune God, but also the oneness among all the believers. Furthermore, it implies enjoyment—our enjoyment of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="31" id="31">[31]</span> Triune God, the Triune God’s enjoyment of us, and also the enjoyment which the believers have with one another. In this fellowship we enjoy the Triune God, and the Triune God enjoys us. Moreover, we enjoy all the believers, and all the believers enjoy us. What a wonderful, universal, mutual enjoyment! We have been called into something which is termed the fellowship of God’s Son. This fellowship is universal and mutual. The mutuality of this fellowship is not only between the believers and the Triune God, but also among the believers themselves. </p>
<p data-content-id="fonV3HEy2MU2N2I0YaxDvgIBiUxgNE7RXijm88oXAqnMbBjw-ecpzlsiH3gTPoymz"> Because we have been called into such a fellowship, we should not say that we are of Paul, of Cephas, of Apollos, or of any other person. Neither should we say that we are of a certain doctrine or of a particular practice. God has not called us into the fellowship of persons, doctrines, and practices. We have not been called into the fellowship of Paul or of anyone else; neither have we been called into a fellowship related to a doctrine or practice. We have been called uniquely into the fellowship of God’s Son. This means that we have been called into the reality, the embodiment, of the Triune God. In this fellowship we enjoy the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In this fellowship we also enjoy all the believers, and the believers enjoy us. Furthermore, the Triune God enjoys us and all the other believers in every place. </p>
<p data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp7mPlbgQrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen"> Would it not be marvelous if all of today’s Christians realized that they had been called into this fellowship? If this were the situation, the world would become like the garden of Eden. There would be no need for the millennium, for the millennium would already be here. However, the actual situation among Christians today is altogether different. Many things have come in to replace Christ as the unique portion of the believers. Even demonic and satanic things have come in. Nevertheless, God has determined that in His economy one Person—His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ—must be everything. He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and He must be constituted into us to become you and me. As we pointed out in the Life-study of Colossians, in <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> the church as the new man, Christ must be everything and everyone. Christ must be the reality of the church. He must also be the reality of every doctrine and practice. The reality of our baptism is Christ, and the substance of our communion is also Christ. If this were the experience of Christians today, how excellent would be the situation among us all! </p>
<p data-content-id="HGln5zZ0kg7BRF2G3k4ch5kayK9fIchfM4oVVifWdxC7j7vo-3Hmf4N_nWwoJM4tK"> The actual situation among believers is very sad, even tragic. Christians may have many things, but lack the reality of Christ, the living Person. In today’s Christianity there are thousands, even millions, of items and things. But where can you find the reality of Christ, the living Person? The situation among the believers in Corinth was an example of this terrible shortage. For this reason, in 1 Corinthians Paul points out to them that it is wrong to say that they are of Paul, Apollos, Cephas, or even of a narrow Christ. That is altogether contrary to God’s economy. In God’s economy there is room only for Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="XfZ84nrEImIc-Nz7b9qjdkNeXbVUzpA1vS8tLSvDe1z-Kgbse9Vggac7oUtrY8Ta8"> I appreciate Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81300" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">verse 2</span>: “With all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours.” Here Paul speaks of all those who call upon the name of the Lord and of every place. Then he says that Christ is both theirs and ours. Concerning believers and places, there is no difference. No matter where you may be when you call on the name of the Lord Jesus, Christ is both yours and also the portion of all the saints. In every place, Christ is theirs and ours. </p>
<p data-content-id="k_DHJPbquZertxEnBc6g-ljfw4I_Y_ACniFdBPR2ooYdTIhcWKx_8CTD37vjRHlBO"> God does not pay attention to anything other than Christ. Why then do we pay attention to so many other things, even other persons, in place of Christ? Certain of the believers in Corinth devoted their attention to Paul. To them Paul would say, “Why do you pay attention to me? I am not worthy of your attention. And why do some of you prefer Cephas or Apollos? They should not be the objects of your attention either. Neither should you concentrate on practices or doctrines. No person, practice, or doctrine is worthy of your attention. Your attention must be focused solely, wholly, and absolutely on Christ, the One into whose fellowship we have been called by God.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="33" id="33">[33]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="nHflLWyF2nFg6U3Z-4mUTN0kfws3Baz2BQZbqn1TEzR-CESxOjvQhJ575ytY-yo5S"> Christ is the center of God’s economy. Among the thousands of verses in the Bible, one verse is extremely crucial regarding this matter, and this verse is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81305" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">Colossians 3:11</span>. Speaking of the new man, Paul says, “Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.” In the light of this verse none of us should boast in matters of race or nationality. During my travels around the world, I have observed that everyone is proud of his country and race. But as believers in Christ, we should not pride ourselves in our race or nationality. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81306" data-verses="Colossians 3:10-11">Colossians 3:10 and 11</span>, the church, the Body of Christ, is the new man. In the new man there are no distinctions of race or nationality. As Paul says, in the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew. The Jews are known for their religion, and the Greeks, for their culture, especially for their philosophy. However, there is room for neither Greek nor Jew in the new man. Paul goes on to say that there cannot be circumcision and <span class="pg" data-page-id="38" id="38">[38]</span> uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or freeman. This indicates that in the new man there is no place for religion or culture, no matter what a particular culture may be. Rather, Christ is all and in all. </p>
<p data-content-id="eUZwTHuTDFPfNYOCu1n50UUorE6pAtRKJ-vM5-aY_zFf532UtF6kNi_wohlwMw9hh"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81307" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">Colossians 3:11</span> gives us a strong basis for saying that in God’s economy Christ is everything. He is every person, every matter, and every thing. Christ must be our race and nationality. If someone asks you to what race you belong, you should reply, “I belong to the race of Christ.” We should have the realization within that we are not Chinese, Germans, French, New Zealanders, Americans, or any other nationality, but are members of Christ. If all Christians knew that Christ is the center of God’s economy, all divisions would disappear. </p>
<p data-content-id="5cvwE7fG0BCj-rNo6NGmlSxcfn8js06QDJiHjBiKtAHd3P8c8SI8FsHkl6iaraK0i"> Not long ago I read that in a certain country members of a particular racial group held a meeting in a cathedral to celebrate an event which they regarded as a victory for their cause. During this meeting, some things were said negatively about another racial group. Afterwards, directly in front of the cathedral there was a clash between members of these different racial groups. What a shame that such a confrontation could take place after a meeting which was supposedly held in the name of Christ! Such a thing is utterly contrary to the nature of the new man. In the church as the new man there are no distinctions on the basis of color; there is no white, black, red, brown, or yellow. To repeat, in the new man Christ is everything; He is all and in all. </p>
<p data-content-id="N9DQWvp40eBT2VybP3ap72SyWkeUtkAvmD_yCQS_h8YrqVB4HFvlImtcJ6D_lT9Tg"> In his preaching to the Corinthians, Paul testified to them of the all-inclusive Christ, of the Christ who is the center of God’s economy and everything in God’s economy. According to his background, Paul was an authentic and typical Jew. As such, he should have avoided all social contact with Greeks. But because Paul realized that in the new man there is no Jew or Greek but that Christ is everything, he could testify to the Greeks in Corinth concerning Christ. He could say, “I wish to testify that Christ is everything and that in the new man there cannot be Jew and Greek. <span class="pg" data-page-id="39" id="39">[39]</span> In the new man, I am not a Jew—I am a person constituted of Christ. But although I have testified concerning this, you insist on remaining in your old social status. You have not taken Christ as the unique, all-inclusive center. Although I declare to you that I have dropped my religion and that I now uplift Christ, you still hold to your Greek culture and philosophy. You know that I was deeply involved with Judaism. I advanced in Judaism beyond many others. But I have abandoned all this. When I came to you, I decided not to know anything among you but Christ and Him crucified. God does not care for Jewish religion or Greek philosophy. He cares only for Christ, because in His economy Christ is the center and everything to us.” </p>

The word portion in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81309" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">Colossians 1:12</span> indicates enjoyment. Christ is the unique enjoyment for all the saints. Nothing should be allowed to replace Him as our portion. Things such as baptism, speaking in tongues, or healing must not replace Christ Himself.

However, instead of saying that we enjoy the meetings, we should testify that we enjoy Christ in the meetings. There is a great difference between enjoying a meeting itself and enjoying Christ in a particular meeting. Certain saints may boast that the meetings in their locality are better than the meetings elsewhere. We must be very careful concerning this. Do not say that you enjoy the meetings in your place. Instead, tell others that you enjoy Christ. We should not be proud of our locality or any other place. In a sense, every locality should be lowered down in our estimation so that we may uplift Christ, our unique portion. The unique portion of <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> the saints is not the church in any particular locality. Our unique portion is Christ. </p>

First, he beseeches them through the name of our Lord, which is the name above all names (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81345" data-verses="Philippians 2:9">Phil. 2:9</span>) and should be the unique name among all His believers. However, by ranking the names of Paul, Apollos, and Cephas with the name of Christ, the divisive Corinthians made the same kind of mistake Peter made on the mount of transfiguration when he ranked Moses and Elijah with Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81346" data-verses="Matthew 17:1-8">Matt. 17:1-8</span>). To keep the oneness in the Lord and to avoid divisions, we need to uplift and exalt the unique name of our Lord by dropping all names other than this highest name. </p>

In this Epistle Paul deals with eleven problems among the believers in Corinth. The first is the matter of division. Division is nearly always the leading problem, bringing in all other problems among the believers. It may be considered the root of the problems among believers. Hence, in dealing with all the problems in the church at Corinth, the apostle’s axe first touches the root, that is, the divisions among them. The first virtue of the walk worthy of God’s calling is the keeping of the oneness of the Spirit in the Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81348" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1-6">Eph. 4:1-6</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="50" id="50">[50]</span> </p>

All such designations should be condemned and rejected. They can only be terminated and eliminated by taking Christ as the unique center among all the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="CFF3xQmaFvwJ5j4xk2Wr_M9AHisFFvvZExIjp81hhQwaE4qISeDhS6DHqSHn3a8XL"> To say “I am of Christ” in the way of excluding the apostles and their teachings or of excluding other believers is as divisive as to say “I am of” this or of that. </p>
<p data-content-id="JIZ-QykqNDG1BWmM2KnMOMhZju_iNYeGSi4tctvoJZcGOh57N2xS8o8hJ8R-wu70-"> These verses indicate that divisions among Christians always result from placing another name above the name of the Lord Jesus. When certain of the Corinthians said, “I am of Apollos,” they automatically uplifted the name of Apollos above the name of Christ. Throughout the centuries, divisions among Christians have been caused by this practice. Today believers commonly designate themselves as Lutherans, Presbyterians, or Baptists without any sense of shame. Actually it is a shame for a Christian to call himself a Lutheran, for this means that he places the name of Luther above the name of Christ. No believer should do such a thing. </p>
<p data-content-id="zjs7tyZL5uIfKl2-jisuY3zjK1KLXAhZDT-hfHIaRDYk9Z7bsjPuLM57LGu0lUUp1"> It is very significant that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81350" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:10">verse 10</span> Paul beseeches the brothers through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. This indicates that we should not uplift any name above this name. For this reason, Christians should not have any kind of designation. To designate ourselves with a name is to make that name higher than the name of Christ. This is a shame both to the Lord and to the believers. However, some Christians are proud to say that they are of a certain denomination. Furthermore, these names are put on signs and are advertised. This indicates how far today’s Christians have gone astray. They have no feeling of shame when they designate themselves by a particular name other than the name of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="anLB0qPKqLGVpnELJCF3jkmpBzp5jxv0utSn82xcw1YQmFAHifmPHXLBQ92ZO24yM"> Through the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Paul charged the believers at Corinth to all speak the same thing. When I was a young Christian, certain Christian leaders told me <span class="pg" data-page-id="51" id="51">[51]</span> that I should not expect all Christians ever to speak the same thing. Do you think it is possible for us as Christians to speak the same thing? If you regard this as possible, I would ask you how we can speak the same thing. As we consider the differences among nations and races today, we see that people do not speak the same thing. For example, the Chinese do not speak the same thing as the Japanese, nor the Germans, as the French. How is it possible for believers of different nationalities to speak the same thing? To answer this question we need to understand what Paul means by the expression “the same thing.” </p>

Thus, for us to speak the same thing means that we all speak concerning Christ and Christ crucified. From experience I can testify that, although according to history it is impossible for Chinese and Japanese, Germans and French, to be truly one, I have seen real oneness among the believers from these different nationalities. It is beautiful to see the genuine oneness between Chinese and Japanese believers and also between German and French believers. Such a oneness is possible only when we concentrate on Christ as our unique center and unique portion. As our unique center and portion, Christ is in all the saints (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81351" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">Col. 1:27</span>) to even become all the saints (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81352" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">Col. 3:11</span>). Whereas many of today’s Christians are divided because they emphasize many things in place of Christ, we are one because we have nothing but Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="yV3PEIgX1GeafzM-ZlWqiZrLTlMVVP6QkUre8G7d8-szYYywPm2y0AATrFvXenxHw"> Christians are divided because they care for many other things instead of Christ. For example, some argue concerning the name in which we should baptize believers. For us, the all-inclusive Christ must be our center and our unique enjoyment. As long as people have a living faith in Christ Jesus, it does not matter whether they are baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus or into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="52" id="52">[52]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="8mSjN8Zzt62gkGo0MycXHksy-YBKtJWbZ5Zv2OyOa49_JwqOmHn6fmadytYtxsWL6"> Because the Lord has raised us up to carry out His recovery, we focus our attention on Christ and not on any practices. We have turned away from everything else to the Lord Himself. This has caused others to spread rumors about us and to criticize us. For example, beginning in 1968, some brothers and sisters were convicted of their oldness and wanted to be buried in the waters of baptism. Eventually, some rumors were spread that we teach re-baptism. The opposers quoted Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81353" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">Ephesians 4</span> concerning one baptism. However, that refers to a baptism which is one in nature or in kind, not to the practice of baptizing a believer one time. It is a fact that we neither teach nor practice re-baptism. If some believers are convicted of their oldness and want to be buried, they should not be condemned for it. </p>
<p data-content-id="0lPdjYmGFHiI5J5XxCYQsri-H6UWaL3fTbYmQmJY3_7MOfbRgf2qmCmeLk8UjNCJ1"> Others have criticized us because we practice calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. Some have even said that this is a mantra and is the same as oriental chanting. </p>
<p data-content-id="7UhQ1h6ietnCG3iSYMQGeKol8eEauxoKw3eSFFoQc6bIZTcaCCwQEPzHoI6-oWcib"> In the past some were distracted by what they thought was a better way of meeting. However, our center is not a certain way of meeting—our center is Christ Himself. Should someone come to you and criticize the way of meeting and propose another way, you should reply, “I don’t care to talk about this. I only know Christ and Him crucified.” Talk about things other than Christ, even about the church meetings, can be a snare. In the Lord’s recovery our only choice and preference is Christ crucified. The best way to silence the gossiping tongue is not to respond when someone seeks to turn you from Christ to other things. Suppose a brother comes to you and says, “How did you feel about the meetings last week?” You should answer, “I don’t care about the meetings—I care only for Christ.” However, if you begin to talk about the meetings, the door will be open for gossip and criticism. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PQd6AGHMk6jAgPz44nxU9j8ur2zdeZu0-E2jUVAEy7EqNuVxyNwhicQJPFxcqffg"> Many Christians today do not talk at all about Christ. In their conversation they are preoccupied with many other things. In the local churches we all need to speak of Christ crucified. Do not discuss the meetings, whether they are <span class="pg" data-page-id="53" id="53">[53]</span> high or low, and do not talk about the church, whether it is good or bad. Likewise, do not speak about the elders, whether they are right or wrong, capable or incapable. Our attitude should be that we care only for Christ, for the church of God in every place, and for the Lord’s recovery. God’s goal in His recovery is to recover Christ as everything to us. </p>

When Paul wrote the book of 1 Corinthians, no doubt there was a specific burden in his spirit. As we read this Epistle, we need to get into the writer’s spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp7m_lSzwrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen"> In order to touch Paul’s spirit in 1 Corinthians, we need to know something of the background both of Paul himself and of the believers in Corinth. Paul was a typical religious Jew, absolutely committed to the religion of his forefathers. Because of his absoluteness for Judaism, he was opposed to the gospel, to the name of Jesus, and to the church. As we know, when he was opposing the church, the Lord Jesus came to him, called him, separated him, commissioned him, and charged him to preach Christ. In obedience to the Lord’s commission, Paul did preach Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="HGln5zZ0kg7BRF2G3k4ch5kayK9fIchfM4YVdxvWdxC7j7vo-3Hmf4N_nWwoJM4tK"> On a particular journey of ministry he visited the city of Corinth, a cultured city in Greece, where many philosophical people lived. To these people Paul preached Christ Jesus. Some of the philosophical Greeks in Corinth received the word of Paul’s preaching, accepted Christ, and were saved. When they were regenerated, they received the initial gifts: eternal life and the Holy Spirit. These initial gifts were sown into them as spiritual seeds. However, after receiving the divine life and the Holy Spirit, they did not live by these <span class="pg" data-page-id="60" id="60">[60]</span> gifts. Instead of living by the divine life and by the Holy Spirit, they still lived a life according to Greek culture. This means that they lived a life of wisdom and philosophy, not a life of Christ. They lived according to their philosophy and worldly wisdom, not according to the divine life and the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="imdufFGU1VpsTYYg4sAVUG-TWWELatFvVn83HJW7L7B-Rv1HfZsOuLeAEkuDTcJUK"> Due to the worldly wisdom of their philosophy, the believers at Corinth had different minds and opinions. They spoke different things and had different preferences and choices. Some said, “I like Paul”; others said, “I prefer Cephas”; and still others said, “My choice is Apollos.” Certain of the Corinthian believers even said, “I like Christ.” These different opinions and ways of speaking opened the door for many evil things to come into the church life, things including strifes, quarrels, fornication, and lawsuits. Regarding married life, there was also confusion and differing opinions. Some said that a brother should leave his wife if she was not willing to go along with him to believe in the Lord. Others advised against this. Thus, among the believers in Corinth there were differing opinions. Even though they were genuine Christians who had received the divine gifts, they were not living a Christian life, but living a Greek life. They were not living a life of divinity, but living a life of philosophy according to their worldly wisdom. As a result, there was confusion among them. This was the background of this Epistle. </p>
<p data-content-id="1mtnlxhyi5vxsNUaDN97plJIxKXrOz7lQpfX_g2zO2SmNPZ4cC3ocFDiy4eTOiBly"> As Paul was writing this Epistle, he was burdened to guide the distracted, philosophical Christians in Corinth back to Christ. These believers had been distracted by their wisdom, philosophy, and culture. Thus, Paul’s spirit was burdened to bring them back to the very Christ whom he had testified to them. This burden in Paul’s spirit is especially evident in the first two chapters of this book. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9eaN6Fdd37GIAwbbB4iu5JzKVZeyCcOvZvRTi5ngEMpuLpI4URJ1klC1LrBzVosWL">THE CRUCIFIED CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="jfI-61Rh_EbH_IA1gDUEXyzj4P3_cZ1Wu-wVQ1OJ9jg9A32Kw2FtbNOlkIQAhHCHk"> The first two chapters of 1 Corinthians are very difficult to understand. You may read these chapters again and again without understanding what Paul is talking about. You may be impressed by many different verses and yet not be able <span class="pg" data-page-id="61" id="61">[61]</span> to see Paul’s main point. The main point in these chapters is that in his spirit Paul was endeavoring to bring the distracted philosophical believers back to Christ. For this reason, in these chapters Paul does not emphasize the resurrected Christ or the ascended Christ; instead, he emphasizes the crucified Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81360" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:2">2:2</span> he says, “I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.” To the Corinthians Paul proclaimed a crucified Christ, a Christ who had been killed. </p>
<p data-content-id="TgPV7WYzePxLg1dlN-g0NWu5ni7DunVU02z8poU42YLj5QKtSQNXUKE8xxgPy_6YT"> We have pointed out that the best way to solve problems among people is to terminate everyone involved. However, the human way of solving problems is to negotiate. God’s way, on the contrary, is not to negotiate, but to terminate. When everyone has been terminated, there is silence. The best way to bring in silence and simplicity is to have a Christ who has been crucified. It seems as if Paul was saying to the Corinthians, “I testified to you a Christ who had been crucified. When I first came to you, I preached to you concerning the crucified Christ. The Lord’s life on earth ended with death by crucifixion.” </p>
<p data-content-id="nHflLWyF2nFg6U3Z-4mUTN0kfws3Baz2BQ5bi0FTEzR-CESxOjvQhJ575ytY-yo5S"> The fact that Christ was crucified implies many things. It implies that He was despised, rejected, and defeated. No one could be crucified without first being rejected and defeated. Through crucifixion Christ suffered man’s rejection. He was able to avoid death by crucifixion, but He did not do so. He could be crucified only because He was willing to be killed. The crucifixion of Christ has silenced the entire universe and simplified the extremely complicated situation in the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="6nl9vMoAoMK12zKD0K5y_Gx6eSA-Vnhw3VwnCL_a_w2PSkAV7X6WzBuN8UC31SJbX"> Deep in his spirit, Paul was yearning to impress the distracted, philosophical Christians in Corinth with this crucified Christ. Among the saints there was turmoil and trouble. Many voices were speaking different things: “I am of Apollos,” “I am of Cephas,” “I am of Paul,” “I am of Christ.” What could silence all these voices? Paul knew that they could be silenced only by a crucified Christ. Therefore, in Paul’s spirit was the burden to bring the believers back to the Christ whom he had preached to them and testified <span class="pg" data-page-id="62" id="62">[62]</span> to them. Paul could say, “The Christ I preached to you was a silent Christ, a Christ who was willing to be crucified without a word. He was willing to be despised, rejected, and put to death. This is the Christ I ministered to you when I came to you. Now I want you to know that such a Christ is God’s power. Only a crucified Christ can save you. God’s saving power is not a strong Christ but a crucified Christ, not a fighting Christ but a defeated Christ.” I repeat, Paul’s spirit was to bring back these striving, philosophical Christians to the simplicity and silence of the crucified Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="RKpt0z8nFNlHi_3vAHu8OcgGgYOj-shs4H-S2ubEU8dkYiKR-u6Z0ZA1R2xXn3ai4"> Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81361" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:17">1:17</span> Paul said that he preached the gospel “not in wisdom of speech that the cross of Christ may not be made void.” In this verse <em>wisdom of speech</em> refers to philosophical speculations. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81362" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:1">2:1</span> Paul says, “And I, when I came to you, brothers, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the mystery of God.” Literally, the Greek word rendered <em>excellence</em> means “elevation” or “superiority.” Paul did not come to Corinth to display excellent speech or philosophical wisdom in announcing the mystery of God. On the contrary, Paul avoided philosophical speculation and excellence of speech and preached the simple word of the cross. The word of the cross is simple, having nothing to do with excellence of speech. </p>
<p data-content-id="sekrxE0ekH4YzjuJnZ6t8c3cdplKbmWoa4itdcsSkFLy5jYO71G6nuPBp_WYYIECE"> When Paul ministered Christ to the Corinthians, he did not exercise philosophical wisdom, for he realized that the Corinthians were a philosophical people, a people who had been born into a philosophical environment and raised under its influence. Paul’s goal was to deliver the Corinthians from the philosophy into which they had been born. Paul seems to be saying, “You were born into philosophy and worldly wisdom. But I came to you not with philosophy, but with Christ and the cross. I did not preach Christ according to the excellence of your philosophical speculations. Instead, I preached Christ to you in a simple way, telling you that He had been crucified. Christ was willing to be despised and rejected. He accepted man’s rejection. When He was arrested, He did not resist. When He was put on the cross, He did not <span class="pg" data-page-id="63" id="63">[63]</span> fight. He was silent, for He was willing to be crucified. This is the Christ I preached to you.” </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81412" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:23-24">1:23 and 24</span> Paul says, “But we preach Christ crucified, to Jews an offense, and to the nations foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, God’s power and God’s wisdom.” </p>

CHRIST CRUCIFIED</h2><p data-content-id="8mSjN8Zzt62gkGo0MycXHksy-YBKtJWbZ65v_dyOa49_JwqOmHn6fmadytYtxsWL6"> As believers in Christ, we all must be able to answer this question: Why was it necessary for Christ to be crucified? In his preaching to the philosophical Greeks at Corinth, Paul must have indicated why it was necessary for Christ to be crucified. Perhaps the most common answer to this question is to say that Christ had to be crucified in order for God to save us. God cannot save us apart from the crucifixion of Christ. According to the New Testament, God has no way to save anyone apart from the cross of Christ. Let us consider briefly why this is so. </p>
<p data-content-id="0lPdjYmGFHiI5J5XxCYQsri-H6UWaL3fTY4mY1ZY3_7MOfbRgf2qmCmeLk8UjNCJ1"> In the universe there are many kinds of problems. There are the problems of Satan, the world, and sin. There is also the problem of man. The man created by God for His purpose fell and became sinful. Other problems related to man are the flesh and the natural life. In addition, everything in the universe has become old; that is, it has become rotten, corrupt. Anything that is not corrupt cannot be old. Oldness indicates a shortage of life. When a tree grows, it has <span class="pg" data-page-id="72" id="72">[72]</span> life. But when it begins to die, there is a shortage of life. Because of Satan, the world, and man with sin, the flesh, and the natural life, the whole universe, including the heavens and the earth, has become old, corrupt, ruined, and full of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="7UhQ1h6ietnCG3iSYMQGeKol8eEauxoKw0-SFHoQc6bIZTcaCCwQEPzHoI6-oWcib"> In addition to all these problems, there is the problem of the ordinances and regulations given by God for man’s living. Therefore, the cross deals with the problems of Satan, the world, sin, man, the flesh, the natural life, oldness, and ordinances. In order for these problems to be solved, it was necessary for Christ to be crucified. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PQd6AGHMk6jAgPz44nxU9j8ur2zdeZu09k2jWVAEy7EqNuVxyNwhicQJPFxcqffg"> Before Christ could be crucified to solve all these problems, He had to put on human nature. This means that He had to become a man, a creature. By becoming a man, Christ became a creature. He took on human nature, not only for the purpose of dying for us and of shedding His blood for our sins, but also for the purpose of solving the problems of Satan, the world, sin, fallen man, the natural life, flesh, oldness, and ordinances. </p>
<p data-content-id="BlFnrZica4yWuQnA7t-H0gDU5fwQYidC2TxvHO3utg7GeZB2ROy6rbjikKwq_wK8F"> Although Christ could have refused death by crucifixion, He was crucified. According to the human understanding, Christ was executed by others. However, His understanding of His death was different. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81413" data-verses="John 10:11">John 10:11</span> the Lord Jesus says, “I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.” Concerning His life, the Lord goes on to say in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81414" data-verses="John 10:18">John 10:18</span>, “No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again.” His life was not taken from Him. On the contrary, He gave up His life for us. If Christ had not been willing to lay down His life, it would not have been possible for people to execute Him. Instead of fighting for Himself, Christ accepted the death of the cross. He was willing to be crucified in order to accomplish redemption and solve all the problems in the universe. Christ crucified is an offense to those who seek signs, and foolishness to those who seek wisdom. But to us who believe He is God’s power and wisdom. <span class="pg" data-page-id="73" id="73">[73]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xedXR7KyftfYy5rRtYIjXLRf-xguDXvOqeMaIW9In7rjMRQgLiFkUjZ1Br4qBKkUQ">II. GOD’S POWER</h2><p data-content-id="rOrhtHgFLbPZdw3O4ue4E_N7etWmKRSVn49w8B0d5A7IYnxmV72X7JLePRUU6vTBF"> In the cross of Christ we see God’s power. It takes the power of God to defeat Satan, the world, sin, fallen man, the flesh, the natural life, the old creation, and the ordinances. What other power is greater than Christ crucified as God’s power? What other power can destroy Satan or overcome the world? Only God has the power to accomplish these things. This power is not that of doing things by speaking, such as the power God exercised in creation. Rather, it is the power of crucifixion, the power of the wonderful death of Christ. This means that the crucifixion of Christ has become the power of God. The death of Christ has become God’s power to destroy Satan, to solve the problem of the world, to eliminate sin, and to terminate fallen man, the flesh, the natural life, and the old creation. By this power God is able also to solve the problem of the ordinances. By one death, the death of Christ, all the problems in the universe have been cleared. Thus, Christ crucified is God’s power to abolish all negative things and carry out His plan. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dRbM-RzPLsExpR48s2PLYESmm-66K_L4CJHbJH9LWljslgHPW3EQrzdq0rf_WG4mx">III. GOD’S WISDOM</h2><p data-content-id="QM-bErH4QMuLGtlKhNiUmVseR6-Mo4MAMaGMZ95bAWzUJ836Exkha9TFHxEakh9zT"> This crucified Christ is also God’s wisdom. In order to accomplish anything, we need both power and wisdom. We have pointed out that wisdom is for planning and purposing, whereas power is for carrying out and accomplishing what is planned and purposed. In God’s economy Christ crucified is both God’s power and His wisdom. It is possible for us to have power or strength without having wisdom or the way. If we have power without wisdom, we may use our strength in a foolish way. Therefore, we need Christ as both power and wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="K9Fhzhq9ETFPCPzdkFWRrkfkDyu0qmgIrzi5siP0zVrET7fYv2qxzXlZDmd0Kk9SX"> The crucified Christ as God’s power and wisdom can be applied to the problem we face with our temper. Without exception, we all are bothered by our temper. Who can say that he has never lost his temper? After experiencing a certain amount of growth in life, we come to hate our temper and long to be free from it. I know of some sisters who, shortly before the day of their wedding, made a vow that they <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> would never again lose their temper, especially never lose it with their husband. However, in every case this vow was broken. Not only in married life but in all kinds of situations in our daily life, we are troubled by our temper. </p>
<p data-content-id="ldCSVKCXVHzwbcJAktI5qY9WW0m-zAHEayRHCYCwzcGvha9kv82E6htYPVBgcHt9H"> Many Christians who love the Lord and seek Him have prayed something like this: “Lord Jesus, You know how easy it is for me to lose my temper. Lord, You are Jehovah the Savior. I ask You to save me from this sin of losing my temper. O Lord, deliver me from this.” Although many have prayed in this way, none have been delivered from their temper as a result. In ourselves we simply do not have either the power to overcome our temper or the wisdom, the way, to do it. We may think that prayer will give us power and wisdom. However, even when we pray, we still do not have power and wisdom. But when we call on the name of the Lord, enjoy Christ, and are filled with the life-giving Spirit, we have no problem with our temper. Spontaneously we have both the power to overcome our temper and the way to deal with it. What is this power and this way? It is the death of Christ. Only the crucified Christ is the power and the wisdom to deal with our temper. </p>
<p data-content-id="OT5FVjm4b3rEEp9If2G1UsfkTjficISBJlQujKTvH9vLo8q-qnrQL8cvvI2WkbUHd"> We may also apply the crucified Christ as God’s power and wisdom to our need for patience. We all desire to be patient. But I have never met a person who is truly patient. We value patience and we desire to be patient, but we cannot be patient. However, when we experience the crucified Christ, we automatically have patience. This crucified Christ becomes to us both the power and the wisdom for patience. As a result, we have both the strength and the way to be patient. Actually, we do not try to be patient. We simply are patient through our experience of Christ crucified. </p>
<p data-content-id="45d-EDyyRdejyAtIco9vv--MfBFfH5nEY0iwT-fJ1z9MAZSXg-0MsBpqMhRa6rO3L"> The crucified Christ can be applied to all manner of human experiences. For more than forty years, we have been preaching nothing other than Christ and Him crucified. Within this crucified Christ there are the elements of resurrection and ascension. Thus, when we enjoy the crucified Christ, we also enjoy His resurrection and ascension. The key to experiencing the resurrection and ascension of Christ is found in Christ’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="75" id="75">[75]</span> crucifixion. Crucifixion is the threshold into all the riches of Christ. The cross is the way to experience Christ with all His riches. Apart from Christ’s crucifixion, there is no gateway for us to enter into the riches of Christ. </p>

The church of God is composed not mainly of the upper class, but of the lowborn of the world and the despised. To appreciate the upper class is against God’s mind and a shame to the church. </p>

In these <span class="pg" data-page-id="79" id="79">[79]</span> verses Paul points out that such an attitude is mistaken. Paul seems to be saying, “Believers at Corinth, do not consider yourselves wise. God does not choose the wise. If you regard yourselves as wise, this means that you have not been chosen by God.

The emphasis in Paul’s spirit was that the Corinthian believers were not living as saved ones. Paul seemed to be telling them, “Dear saints in Corinth, you are saved ones, God’s chosen ones. But you are not living the life of chosen ones. Rather, you are living as if you had not been chosen by God. There is no indication in your living that God has chosen you, for you think of yourselves as wise, strong, and wellborn. Brothers, you must realize that God does not choose such ones. If you regard yourselves as wise, this indicates that God has not chosen you. Remember, He has chosen the foolish ones to shame the wise, the weak ones to shame the strong, and the lowborn to shame the wellborn. Thus, do not regard yourselves as wise, strong, and wellborn.” </p>
<p data-content-id="prVBOIVQEyCQk7WbC65wKBFpZIyHUt92uL6Jhg63N6sMf93hlzv0FeRHAEKBhJS-J"> It is easy to talk about living Christ, but it is difficult to practice living Him. As long as we consider ourselves wise, we do not live Christ. All those who truly live Christ regard themselves as foolish, weak, and lowborn. They think of themselves as nothing and realize that their existence on earth does not mean anything. They can say of themselves, “I am among the things which are not. I live in a certain locality, but my existence here does not mean anything. But although I am nothing, God has chosen me.” I repeat, God does not choose the wise, the strong, or the wellborn. If you consider yourself wise, strong, and wellborn, you reject God’s choosing. By the way you live, you renounce God’s choosing. <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> God shames the wise, the strong, and the wellborn. We all should be able to say, “Lord, I confess that I am not wise or powerful. Instead, I truly am foolish, weak, and among the lowborn.” What was in Paul’s spirit in writing this portion of 1 Corinthians was an emphasis on this matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="vFgafReeId0NLp6vSzTQo14EsX_DOCFd3SvaOpYgGNBc9CrkwduxPEplaAWErKNdi"> In his spirit Paul also sensed the need to lower down the haughty Greek believers. Certain ones among them may have been very intelligent and wise, but Paul paid no attention to that. On the contrary, he was seeking to point out that the very fact that they had been chosen by God proved that they were foolish, not wise; weak, not strong; and lowborn, not wellborn. Therefore, it was a mistake for the believers in Corinth to think that they were wise and powerful. </p>
<p data-content-id="WPLFJeiDr66zP26-znBSbuxrk_rGZbWa3iyyz9wagmclIUlGYx9j371es8KAwySLd"> We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81434" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:28">verse 28</span> Paul says that God will “bring to nought” the things which are. The meaning of the Greek word here, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81435" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81436" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>, is to destroy. To be brought to nought by God actually means to be destroyed by Him. If we study history, we shall see that many people of honor have been brought to nought by God. Many with a high social standing have been destroyed, made nothing, by Him. We should never consider ourselves something. If we view ourselves as something, God will bring us to nothing. </p>

<p data-content-id="YAf-ThL_BpKj4Bal8Hh8S_ZBAgDwrplD9fOUGWc4sdE5fnGiiRPa9o6wxsU4R57wn"> In this message we shall consider four crucial matters covered in the first ten chapters of 1 Corinthians. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81463" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1:2</span> Paul says, “To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours.” I do not believe that most readers of this Epistle pay adequate attention to all the points mentioned in this verse. A crucial matter in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81464" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1:2</span> is Paul’s expression “theirs and ours.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81465" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">verse 9</span> Paul goes on to say, “God is faithful, through Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.” In this verse the crucial matter is the fellowship of the Son of God. In the sequence of experience, this follows the vital point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81466" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">verse 2</span>. A third important matter is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81467" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">6:17</span>. Here Paul says, “But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.” In our experience, the matter of being one spirit with the Lord follows being called by God into the fellowship of His Son. The fourth crucial matter is related to the fellowship of the blood of Christ and of the body of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81468" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:16">10:16</span> Paul speaks of this: “The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a fellowship of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a fellowship of the body of Christ?” This verse refers to the Lord’s table. Thus, in these verses the four crucial matters are Christ being theirs and ours, the fellowship of the Son of God, being one spirit with the Lord, and the Lord’s table. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="EKLQNzB20IJMJNZAsXkVbasdhWNIKYBtXkX0rYADmdSh2KIOAd4oaYB8TBbVW9IBJ">THE PERSON OF PAUL AND HIS SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="DeXM5GXdbazrZOx-ax9Rc0jrX8cWBb4GIeXtLq5XJuzK9JlkY0coVF7VTZZGpUzMQ"> As a help to understanding these matters, we need to consider the way Paul deals with the problems among the <span class="pg" data-page-id="88" id="88">[88]</span> believers at Corinth. The way a person handles a problem invariably depends on what kind of person he is. The same problem will be dealt with in different ways by different persons. For example, one who holds a high office in the government will handle a problem differently from one who is a thief or a robber. Likewise, a learned professor will deal with a problem differently from a person with very limited education. To be sure, a government official, a thief, a professor, and an uneducated person will each deal with the same problem in a different way. In each case, the way the problem is handled will depend entirely on the person taking care of the problem. In keeping with this principle, the way Paul deals with the problems among the Corinthians is based on the kind of person he is. Therefore, to understand how Paul deals with the problems we must first know what kind of person he was and what was within him. </p>
<p data-content-id="S4UBTaDBLhflHNtSeJetHIxvSeWeK0YxbM1Fdz7ZupcAWEz0O3GGyaxAZbn0GYdQO"> In reading 1 Corinthians we need to get into Paul’s spirit and touch the burden in his spirit. To touch Paul’s spirit in this way is to touch the reality of his being. A person’s spirit is the reality of his being. This means that your spirit is the real you, the true person. The reality of our being is not our mind or emotion, much less any aspect of our physical body. The reality of our being as persons is our spirit. For this reason, a person is often the most genuine when he loses his temper, because at such a time his spirit comes forth. However, when we behave ourselves carefully and act in a certain way, we may cover up our real being and not express our real person. Only when our spirit comes forth do we manifest the reality of our being. Many times this occurs when we are angry and lose our temper. The point here is that only when we touch a person’s spirit do we contact the reality of his being. </p>
<p data-content-id="gtgtI35Vr92rZOQoDGIVGs8NRXsfme5u0Rt26HwlaZ2BEOI4Y3brU9LirmsGa_3J7"> In reading the Bible it is very important that we touch the spirit of the writer. Otherwise, we shall not understand the meaning of what he says. We shall know his writings only on the surface and according to letters in black and white. But when we get into a writer’s spirit, we touch the depth of his writings. <span class="pg" data-page-id="89" id="89">[89]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ldCSVKCXVHzwbcJAktI5qY9WW0m-zAHEbwRHCaCwzcGvha9kv82E6htYPVBgcHt9H"> When Paul wrote 1 Corinthians, he was a person infused with the Triune God. He had been filled, permeated, and saturated with the Father, Son, and Spirit. Moreover, in a full way Paul had seen the vision concerning God’s economy. He realized that the intention of the Triune God is to dispense Himself into His chosen and redeemed people. As one of God’s redeemed people, Paul had experienced this dispensation. Paul certainly knew that God the Father is the source, that God the Son is the course, and that God the Spirit is the flow. He also had a clear realization that the Triune God had been dispensed into him for a goal and that this goal is the corporate expression of God. All these things were not only clear to Paul, but they were also in him and part of his very being. Thus, Paul was a person infused with the Triune God and His economy. This should help us see what kind of person Paul was, what were the basic elements in his being. </p>
<p data-content-id="OT5FVjm4b3rEEp9If2G1UsfkTjficISBInQujITvH9vLo8q-qnrQL8cvvI2WkbUHd"> Since Paul was a person saturated with the Triune God and His economy, he dealt with the problems among the believers at Corinth according to the kind of person he was. If we understand this, we shall be able to understand why Paul dealt with the church in Corinth the way he did. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="45d-EDyyRdejyAtIco9vv--MfBFfH5nEZ2iwQ-_J1z9MAZSXg-0MsBpqMhRa6rO3L">THOSE WHO CALL ON THE NAME<br/>OF THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="oHvwn1F9kPbTytIPVynf_MGPeusawFjhQrpMyO7fRRrtjdCyM9IgKVBeI7sBRsMLT"> In dealing with the problems in the church at Corinth, Paul includes the verses we quoted at the beginning of this message. Even <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81469" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1:2</span> is an aspect of Paul’s handling of the problems. In this verse Paul refers to those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours. It may seem to most readers of this book that this verse has nothing to do with the problems Paul confronts later in this Epistle. Furthermore, it may appear that nothing in this verse is helpful in solving these problems. When I studied this book many years ago, making a detailed outline of the whole Epistle and writing many notes, I did not pay much attention to this verse. I wondered what a statement about calling on the name of the Lord Jesus in every place had to do <span class="pg" data-page-id="90" id="90">[90]</span> with the problems among the believers at Corinth. If I had been the writer, I probably would not have included this verse. Nevertheless. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81470" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1:2</span> contains an important tool used by Paul in dealing with the problems among the Corinthians. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3E2ZRbJydxokD8WKMAIbtFfHb0jzb68DhKLroqmbxR9wRW14_fX2fsKcexAdJrzWM">THE FELLOWSHIP OF GOD’S SON</h2><p data-content-id="GBDJJALJ0cF4ks8AH19ucJjnWsP4LTnCCAoKC7XhfQlZ2XYUYk_NIq7g1JKhMOSI_"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81471" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">First Corinthians 1:9</span> seems to be more directly related to the problems among the Corinthians. Paul begins this verse by saying, “God is faithful.” Then he goes on to say that through this faithful God we have been called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ. I do not think that the Corinthian believers understood what Paul meant by the fellowship of the Son of God. But why would he use an expression that his readers could not understand? What was his aim in pointing out that they had been called into the fellowship of God’s Son? What help could this render to the divisive Corinthians, to those who were saying that they were of Paul, Apollos, Cephas, or of a narrow Christ? To the Corinthians this must have sounded like a foreign language. As this Epistle was read among them, some may have said to themselves, “Paul, why do you tell us that we have been called into the fellowship of the Son of God? What do you mean by this?” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="c72SBDvLnZO0HTNpK_Y1vJj4uYnRW9aVzImG7suhmUkJUykeLnr0FNqIv6PWDSSzw">ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="YAf-ThL_BpKj4Bal8Hh8S_ZBAgDwrplD9fOUCFM4sdE5fnGiiRPa9o6wxsU4R57wn"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81472" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:12-20">6:12-20</span> Paul deals with the abuse of freedom in foods and in the body. Suddenly, he inserts the words, “But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.” We may wonder what this sentence has to do with the abuse of eating and of the body. Of course, we may gain some understanding by reading this verse in its context. But if we do not have Paul’s vision, we shall not understand why this verse is inserted. We shall not appreciate that it is a very useful tool in dealing with the Corinthians and their problems. </p>

These terms and expressions are not found elsewhere in Paul’s writings. The first extraordinary verse is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81503" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1:2</span>. Here Paul says, “To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours.” The expression “called saints” is unusual. Many Christians do not have the assurance that they are saints. Have you ever praised the Lord for the fact that you are a saint? Do you even have the concept, or thought, that you are a saint? If I were to declare boldly that I am a saint, some might accuse me of pride, saying that I am simply a Chinese man by blood and a Christian by faith. Nevertheless, Paul speaks of those who received this Epistle as “called saints.” This is an extraordinary term. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mdwix_GaOy3SQn0ueCAHqoNdP1UMTDSJOzaRQ9hvWkxI-OJG9yVXJjndZOAKNjsqN"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81504" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">verse 2</span> Paul also refers to the matter of calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place. Then he goes on to say that Christ is “theirs and ours.” The very Christ on whose name we call is both theirs and ours. Perhaps you have read this verse many times without paying attention to this expression. The significance of these words is deep and profound. </p>
<p data-content-id="VAmSFImgVrwWBDh3eU1j3ZFZPnAW6HkY4JuA5IZXxzEgwGujPfsebgBAiBEiWFZI6"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81505" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">1:9</span> Paul says, “God is faithful, through Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.” Every Christian realizes that God is faithful. It is also common for Christians to realize that God is merciful, gracious, and loving. Few Christians, however, realize that they have been called into the fellowship of the Son of God, <span class="pg" data-page-id="96" id="96">[96]</span> and few have an adequate understanding of what this fellowship is. Christians often ask others if they have been saved, but rarely do they inquire if a person has been called. Has anyone ever approached you and asked, “Have you been called by God into the fellowship of His Son?” In this verse Paul speaks not of being saved, but of being called. Furthermore, he does not say that we have been called to heaven or to eternal blessings; he says that we have been called into the fellowship of God’s Son. </p>
<p data-content-id="imdufFGU1VpsTYYg4sAVUG-TWWELatFvUmc3Ob27L7B-Rv1HfZsOuLeAEkuDTcJUK"> The Christ on whom we call is theirs and ours. We have been called by the faithful God into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. This is very deep and profound. Throughout the centuries, Christians have not adequately touched the depth and the profoundness of these matters. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1mtnlxhyi5vxsNUaDN97plJIxKXrOz7lRo_X3yGzO2SmNPZ4cC3ocFDiy4eTOiBly">GOD’S GOOD PLEASURE</h2><p data-content-id="PxQUR1aSfVg1g5EN0uN6GBmA7oa_DRqoHBo2oKF94p-AdYjLrSH1ujpvA-dj4BNGp"> If we would understand these two verses, we need to go back to the beginning with God in eternity past. Before God created the universe, He had a pleasure, a heart’s desire. Every human being is seeking some kind of pleasure. God also has His pleasure. According to this good pleasure, God made a plan. This plan was to dispense Himself into a number of human beings, to work Himself into them. This is God’s pleasure, His delight. Christians cannot adequately know the meaning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81506" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1:2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81507" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">9</span> unless they realize this. </p>
<p data-content-id="-31E-FlFhHZVWfRVsibLPN9Po-xOz3xAwP55Vv-NyImqaLANCOsF5aHepDtdpWJmP"> Few Christians realize that God has a pleasure and that His plan is to dispense Himself into us and work Himself into us. Yet this is revealed in the Bible. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81508" data-verses="Ephesians 1:5">Ephesians 1:5</span> Paul speaks of “the good pleasure of His will,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81509" data-verses="Ephesians 1:9">verse 9</span>, of “His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself.” Furthermore, Paul uses the word dispensation several times. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81510" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span> he speaks of a “dispensation of the fullness of the times,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81511" data-verses="Ephesians 3:9">Ephesians 3:9</span> he refers to “the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, Who created all things.” To repeat, God’s good pleasure is to dispense Himself into us and work Himself into us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="97" id="97">[97]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="WPLFJeiDr66zP26-znBSbuxrk_rGZbWa2gyyw8QagmclIUlGYx9j371es8KAwySLd"> At this point we need to ask a crucial question: How is it possible for God to dispense Himself into us? First, God created the heavens, the earth, and man. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81512" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">Zechariah 12:1</span> says that the Lord stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. The human spirit is a special organ created by God for man to receive God. We may use a transistor radio as an illustration. A transistor radio contains a receiver which picks up the sound waves in the air. We can compare ourselves to the radio, and our spirit to the receiver. The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man, created with a spirit, is for God. Because man has a spirit, a receiver, it is possible for him to take God into him. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="2x5QcsCAgui9NXQYMVnCg51gf1NTLk96HxwmcyHan8nZifIVz9C609J7eMcjMZTbI">Incarnation</h2><p data-content-id="uEOnd0iMx5POKDetv2t0ZpmBAFDGOo1C9lZS1JDWbwDZZmpB_EzDqM1j3iDcpaIYK"> Long after God accomplished the work of creation, the first step toward the dispensing of Himself into us, God took the second step—incarnation. One day, the infinite God, the very God who created the universe, became a man. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81513" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81514" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>, the Word, who is God, became flesh; that is, God became a man. In the words of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81515" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>, a child has been born to us whose name is called the mighty God. The baby born in a manger in Bethlehem was actually the mighty God. The Lord Jesus lived on earth in a lowly way. He was raised in the home of a carpenter, and He Himself worked as a carpenter. Who would have thought that the very God dwelt in Him? At the age of thirty He came forth to minister. Certain of the things He did caused people to wonder about Him. His words were far more philosophical than anything uttered by the greatest philosophers. Some of those who heard Him marveled and said, “How does this man know letters, having never learned?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81516" data-verses="John 7:15">John 7:15</span>). Others were offended and claimed to know His mother, brothers, and sisters. Eventually, the Lord Jesus went to the cross and died. <span class="pg" data-page-id="98" id="98">[98]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="fonV3HEy2MU2N2I0YaxDvgIBiUxgNE7RWjzm89oXAqnMbBjw-ecpzlsiH3gTPoymz">Crucifixion</h2><p data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp6nflbjQrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen"> By incarnation the Lord took on humanity. Man is the head of the old creation. When Adam, the representative of the entire creation, fell, the whole creation fell and became old. When God put on humanity, He put on the entire old creation. Thus, when Christ was crucified, the creation was crucified also. Therefore, by His death on the cross, the Lord terminated the entire creation, including you and me. Through this wonderful, all-inclusive death, Christ redeemed us; He brought us back to God. Not only did He terminate us and bring us back to God, but in resurrection He replaces us with Himself. Therefore, the Lord has terminated us, brought us back to God, and is replacing us in resurrection with Himself. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="HGln5zZ0kg7BRF2G3k4ch5kayK9fIchfN54VVhfWdxC7j7vo-3Hmf4N_nWwoJM4tK">Resurrection</h2><p data-content-id="XfZ84nrEImIc-Nz7b9qjdkNeXbVUzpA1uTstITPDe1z-Kgbse9Vggac7oUtrY8Ta8"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81517" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span> the Lord Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life.” The Lord as resurrection is the element with which we are replaced. Furthermore, in resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81518" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>). Resurrection is actually the living Person of Christ, the One who is God incarnate, who lived on earth as a man, who died on the cross for our redemption, and who in resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit. Thus, Christ is both the resurrection and the Spirit. He has become the Spirit, and the Spirit is resurrection. Now He as the Spirit and as the resurrection is our replacement. </p>
<p data-content-id="k_DHJPbquZertxEnBc6g-ljfw4I_Y_ACmjVdCOx2ooYdTIhcWKx_8CTD37vjRHlBO"> After Christ became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, it was possible for Him to come into us. He, the divine electricity, can come into our receiver. However, it is necessary for us to receive Him by repenting, believing in Him, and calling on His name. A sinner may pray, “Lord Jesus, I am sinful. But, Lord, You are my Savior. Now I open myself to You and receive You.” Whenever a person prays in such a way, this dear, excellent, wonderful One, the very One who is the Spirit and resurrection, enters into him. This is not mere theology—it is a marvelous fact. Every genuine Christian can testify that when he believed in the Lord and called on His name, something unusual happened to him. The Lord as <span class="pg" data-page-id="99" id="99">[99]</span> the life-giving Spirit came into him. Once we have received the Lord into us, He will never leave, even if we sometimes regret that we have become a Christian. After you have believed in the Lord Jesus, you will not be able to stop believing in Him. Once He has come into you, He will never leave. Now we can see by what way God dispenses Himself into us. </p>

He is the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. As God incarnate, He lived as a man on earth for thirty-three and a half years. Through His death on the cross, He crucified the old creation. In so doing, He brought creation back to God. Now that Christ has terminated us on the cross, what He has terminated He is replacing with Himself in resurrection. In resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit. Actually, the life-giving Spirit is resurrection. Thus, resurrection is not merely a thing or a matter—it is a living Person. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81534" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span> the Lord Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life.” </p>
<p data-content-id="wIQrvVteeI1oKV87cJZVVv5dOgX231XUuolU0B3r25XvLEhXjHSjbC3_2HzXXD3x4"> Today the wonderful Person of Christ, the One through whom all things were created, the One who has passed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.

<p data-content-id="LCOBHh-_8rtpkoOSBhuJ3SLJouiGtADmTc7cP07K7WCcffclCOEo5EYkos9Kc9G0W"> If someone asks us where we are today, we should say that we are in resurrection. Resurrection is the life-giving Spirit, the life-giving Spirit is Christ, and Christ is the processed Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="mA_96h-ZPzHjy0DOYoWw3UVdng1dAcNQIYq0rMc6FnoHymfKQciucRWHW48k6Jjdb"> In the book of 1 Corinthians Paul deals with eleven problems. Six of these problems are covered in the first ten chapters, and five are covered in the last six chapters. The first six problems are division, lawsuits, incest, the abuse of freedom in eating and in marriage, the question of marriage itself, and the eating of sacrifices to idols. All these problems <span class="pg" data-page-id="106" id="106">[106]</span> are related to humanity, to human life. The second group of problems involves the realm of God’s administration. These five problems involve headship, the Lord’s table, spiritual gifts, resurrection, and the gift of material things. In dealing with the problem of resurrection Paul utters a wonderful word. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81535" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">15:45</span> he says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. This is resurrection. When Christ was simply the last Adam, He was not yet in resurrection. Rather, He was in the flesh, in humanity. But through death He entered into resurrection. Now in resurrection He is no longer in the flesh, for He is the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is the reality of resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="EKLQNzB20IJMJNZAsXkVbasdhWNIKYBtXk30sKgDmdSh2KIOAd4oaYB8TBbVW9IBJ"> When we are in the spirit, we are in resurrection. Resurrection is life which overcomes death. If we are truly in resurrection experientially, we are fresh and living, with life bubbling up from within. In such a case, we can be compared to a green plant. A living plant may be used as an illustration of resurrection. If a plant is flourishing and blossoming, we may say that it is in resurrection. But if the plant is withering and dying, we cannot say that it is in resurrection. Likewise, if we are living and fresh, we are truly in resurrection. But if we sit in the meetings in a formal, religious way, we certainly are not in resurrection. On the contrary, for the most part, we are still in the tomb. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="DeXM5GXdbazrZOx-ax9Rc0jrX8cWBb4GIe3tN4JXJuzK9JlkY0coVF7VTZZGpUzMQ">PAUL’S WAYS OF DEALING WITH PROBLEMS</h2><p data-content-id="S4UBTaDBLhflHNtSeJetHIxvSeWeK0YxbMVFUh7ZupcAWEz0O3GGyaxAZbn0GYdQO"> We have pointed out that the first six problems covered in 1 Corinthians are related to human living. Paul’s way of dealing with these problems is very different from the way practiced by today’s ministers and pastors. For example, if a married couple has a problem and consults their pastor, he will deal with their problem either in a religious way or in a natural way. Paul’s way is profound and very difficult to describe. His way of dealing with problems is gradually revealed in the first ten chapters. Paul’s way is spiritual and uplifted. We may liken his way to a chain which has many parts linked together. The first chapter of this Epistle begins with one part of the chain, and the last chapter ends with <span class="pg" data-page-id="107" id="107">[107]</span> another part. Paul begins with the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81536" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1:2</span> concerning Christ being theirs and ours. The problems among the believers at Corinth were all due to the fact that they were neglecting Christ as their unique portion. Their portion was not Greek philosophy or worldly wisdom; it was the all-inclusive Christ ministered by Paul. This all-inclusive Christ is both theirs and ours. This means that He is our unique portion. </p>
<p data-content-id="gtgtI35Vr92rZOQoDGIVGs8NRXsfme5u0RN2yVglaZ2BEOI4Y3brU9LirmsGa_3J7"> If a couple having problems in married life were to contact Paul, he would not help them in a religious way. He would not charge the husband to love his wife or the wife to submit to her husband. This, however, is the way practiced by pastors today. Paul’s way of dealing with human problems is very different. Even his word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81537" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1:2</span> concerning the called saints, those sanctified in Christ Jesus, and those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours, is a word related to the problems covered in this Epistle. Although this verse does not appear to be part of Paul’s way of approaching human problems, it actually contains the spiritual riches used by Paul to solve the problems. According to this verse, we Christians must realize that the all-inclusive Christ is ours. Furthermore, we are called saints, those who have been called by God to call upon the dear and precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. If a married sister calls on the name of the all-inclusive Christ, she will be truly submissive to her husband. The reason wives are not submissive is that they are short of the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ. Sisters, when you have trouble being submissive to your husbands, simply call on the name of the Lord. I assure you that after calling a few times, the Lord will touch you and supply you. Spontaneously you will become a very submissive wife. This is the result of enjoying Christ as your portion. </p>
<p data-content-id="eUZwTHuTDFPfNYOCu1n50UUorE6pAtRKI_fM5_aY_zFf532UtF6kNi_wohlwMw9hh"> Over the years sisters have often come to me with problems concerning married life. In many cases I not only sympathized with the sisters, but also agreed with them. In the early years of my ministry I behaved in the same way many pastors do. I encouraged the sisters to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81538" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5 </span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="108" id="108">[108]</span> and also to pray, even with fasting if necessary. Many times a sister would return to say that what I had suggested did not work. All I could do then was tell the sister to be comforted and that I would try to help her. Actually, I was not any help whatever. Gradually I learned that problems in married life are not solved simply by praying and reading the Bible. Nourishment and life supply are necessary. We cannot receive the nourishment we need simply from the Bible in black and white letters, for what we need is the living Christ Himself. By pray-reading the Word and by calling on the name of the Lord, we receive the needed nourishment and supply. When a sister is supplied in this way, she can find the solution to the problem she faces with her husband. </p>
<p data-content-id="5cvwE7fG0BCj-rNo6NGmlSxcfn8js06QCISHjAiKtAHd3P8c8SI8FsHkl6iaraK0i"> Sometimes when I call on the name of the Lord Jesus, I am deeply touched by Him and even weep. This touch then becomes my nourishment, supply, and strength. Moreover, I have realized that by calling on the name of the Lord, I can do things which I am not able to do in my own strength. This is the enjoyment of Christ according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81539" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1:2</span>. If we call on the name of the Lord Jesus in every place, we shall know that Christ is ours, and we shall enjoy Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="N9DQWvp40eBT2VybP3ap72SyWkeUtkAvnCPyCRS_h8YrqVB4HFvlImtcJ6D_lT9Tg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81540" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">First Corinthians 1:9</span> says, “God is faithful, through Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.” We have been called into the fellowship of the all-inclusive Christ as our portion. This fellowship is nothing less than the living Person of the all-inclusive Christ. This means that we have been called into this Person and into His fellowship. God has called us into Christ for our co-participation and enjoyment. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tiNQgxDpsd4NWazI4KY7Ls3Zc1jf31TN-nG0onJv7jbyJhqTUCAeHZ8B89sG6uKJy">ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="h8T7ZUYpMcEVtTeTw4Ei-WaWWau_ZtkWC157SjFWsI31mZB3IXYJad2ffrJvNMmVr"> We have seen that the all-inclusive Christ is our portion and that we have been called into the fellowship of this Christ. But how can the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ become our portion for our enjoyment? To understand this we need to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81541" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">6:17</span>. In this verse Paul declares, “He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.” The fellowship into which we have been called is Christ as the <span class="pg" data-page-id="109" id="109">[109]</span> life-giving Spirit. To experience this fellowship we must be one spirit with Him. In our spirit we are one with the life-giving Spirit. </p>

Here Paul says that to those who are called, the ones who were chosen by God in eternity and who have come to believe in Christ, Christ is God’s power and wisdom. As those who have been called by God to call on the name of the Lord, Christ is God’s power and wisdom to us. </p>

We have seen that to be called into the fellowship of Christ means to be called into the co-enjoyment of Christ as our unique portion. In the second part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81556" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:24">chapter one</span> Paul shows us various aspects of the enjoyment of this wonderful portion. We may use a chicken dinner as an illustration. When you are served a platter of chicken, the host may ask you what part of the chicken you prefer, the wings, the breast, or the leg. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81557" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:24">verses 24</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81558" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">30</span> we have different aspects of Christ; we have the “wings,” “breast,” and “legs” of Christ for our enjoyment. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81559" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">verse 2</span> Paul speaks of our portion, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81560" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">verse 9</span> he tells us that we have been called into the enjoyment of this portion. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81561" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:24">verses 24</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81562" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">30</span> we see the aspects <span class="pg" data-page-id="116" id="116">[116]</span> of this portion for our enjoyment. From these verses we realize that we may enjoy Christ as God’s wisdom and God’s power. Furthermore, Christ as God’s wisdom includes righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. My burden in this message is to consider from the standpoint of our experience how Christ is wisdom to us from God, including righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="WPLFJeiDr66zP26-znBSbuxrk_rGZbWa2gSy5vwagmclIUlGYx9j371es8KAwySLd">THE DIVINE WAY</h2><p data-content-id="2x5QcsCAgui9NXQYMVnCg51gf1NTLk96HxQmUh3an8nZifIVz9C609J7eMcjMZTbI"> It is not easy to understand or explain wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. I prefer to speak of these matters according to spiritual experience. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81563" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:24">verses 24</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81564" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">30</span> the wisdom of God denotes the divine way. If we have wisdom, we shall know the proper way to do things. But if we are not wise, our way of doing things will be foolish. In order to have the best way, we must have wisdom. Wisdom in these verses is equal to the way in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81565" data-verses="John 14:6">John 14:6</span>, a verse where the Lord Jesus says, “I am the way.” Apart from Christ as the way, we do not have access to the Father. Hence, God’s way is His wisdom. How can we enjoy God and participate in Him? If we would enjoy Him and participate in Him, we must have a way, and this way is God’s wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp6n_lbhQrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen"> We may use learning to drive an automobile as an illustration of the relationship between wisdom and the way. One who is learning to drive may find it difficult to turn the car. Because he does not have adequate wisdom, he does not have the way to turn the car properly. However, a skillful and experienced driver has the wisdom to manage the car. He has the way to control it, to make it go where he desires. This way is the driver’s wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="HGln5zZ0kg7BRF2G3k4ch5kayK9fIchfN5YVVjfWdxC7j7vo-3Hmf4N_nWwoJM4tK"> As wisdom to us from God as God’s way, Christ is righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Actually, these are three steps of the way. This understanding is, of course, related to our experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="XfZ84nrEImIc-Nz7b9qjdkNeXbVUzpA1uTMtLTvDe1z-Kgbse9Vggac7oUtrY8Ta8"> Suppose a sister has a problem with her husband. She exercises her spirit and calls on the name of the Lord Jesus. As a result, she is rescued from the problem. To speak more exactly, she receives Christ as wisdom to her from God. Before <span class="pg" data-page-id="117" id="117">[117]</span> she learned to exercise her spirit and call on the Lord’s name, she would argue with her husband. This is foolish. Nevertheless, wives often argue with their husbands, trying to convince them and even to subdue them. For example, a certain husband may habitually come home late. Relying on her natural wisdom, the wife may try to change her husband’s behavior. However, the more she argues with him, the more frequently he comes home late. His wife’s arguing actually causes the problem to become worse. Instead of arguing with her husband, the wife should exercise her spirit and call on the name of the Lord. Then she will have the wisdom, the way, to deal with the problem. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="k_DHJPbquZertxEnBc6g-ljfw4I_Y_ACmj1dBOR2ooYdTIhcWKx_8CTD37vjRHlBO">BECOMING RIGHTEOUS</h2><p data-content-id="JIZ-QykqNDG1BWmM2KnMOMhZju_iNYeGTjotcsvoJZcGOh57N2xS8o8hJ8R-wu70-"> Righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are the materials used in the construction of the freeway in our Christian life. Have you ever realized that wisdom is our way, our freeway, and that righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are the materials used in making this freeway? This is very true to our Christian experience. When we enjoy Christ, the first aspect of the divine virtue, the divine goodness, we shall experience is God as our righteousness. Whenever we enjoy Christ and experience Him, we first have God as our righteousness. This means that when we exercise our spirit and call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we become righteous. The more we call, the more righteous we become. </p>
<p data-content-id="zjs7tyZL5uIfKl2-jisuY3zjK1KLXAhZCSuhfGIaRDYk9Z7bsjPuLM57LGu0lUUp1"> Let us again refer to an illustration from married life. It certainly is wrong for a husband to come home late at night. Nevertheless, a wife may be wrong and unrighteous in the way she deals with her husband concerning this matter. She may be altogether unfair, condemning him and putting all the blame on him. She never condemns herself or blames herself. Her attitude is also wrong, and she is unrighteous in arguing with her husband. Even though the husband may be just ten percent wrong, the wife condemns him as if he were completely wrong. Therefore, her attitude and behavior toward her husband are ninety percent unrighteous. <span class="pg" data-page-id="118" id="118">[118]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="anLB0qPKqLGVpnELJCF3jkmpBzp5jxv0vsCn83xcw1YQmFAHifmPHXLBQ92ZO24yM"> Whenever a husband and wife exchange words, both parties are unrighteous. The husband will declare that he is right and that his wife is completely wrong. The wife will insist that the husband is wholly wrong and that only she is right. As a result, both the husband and the wife become unrighteous. Should the wife begin to exercise her spirit and call on the name of the Lord Jesus, she will realize that she has been unfair and unrighteous in relation to her husband. Then she will say to herself, “Yes, my husband is wrong to a certain extent. But I put too much blame upon him. Furthermore, I am wrong to argue with him and to condemn him. Now I see that he is wrong only to a small degree, but that I am much more wrong than he is. I am at least twice as unrighteous as my husband is.” When the sister realizes her situation by calling on the name of the Lord, she spontaneously becomes righteous, for Christ becomes righteousness to her. </p>
<p data-content-id="b6PkOnBRxPH-JZwYqEGn8CHT8qNMfaW8DdlW5oQUwlEPRETelPUlRIL-iaR1qLEZU"> Whenever there is strife or argument between people, none of the parties involved is righteous. For example, suppose an elder and a brother in the church have an argument. Instead of exercising his spirit to call on the name of the Lord, the elder stands up for himself. In such a case, he is not righteous. Furthermore, he may say to the other elders, “That particular brother always brings death into the meetings.” Later, when this elder exercises his spirit and calls on the name of the Lord, he realizes that he was unrighteous. He may also realize that the brother in question rarely spreads death in the meetings. The elder, however, has told others that this brother always brings death into the meetings of the church. Therefore, this elder, realizing that he was not righteous, will need to confess to the other elders and say, “Brothers, I ask you to forgive me for what I said about this brother. I have made confession to the Lord, and He has forgiven me. Now I also make confession to you. According to my memory, only on one occasion has this brother brought death into the meetings. But I said that he always does this. I was not fair, neither was I righteous.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="119" id="119">[119]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="k_DHJPbquZertxEnBc6g-ljfw4I_Y_ACmiFdFcB2ooYdTIhcWKx_8CTD37vjRHlBO"> If we read 1 Corinthians only in a superficial way, we may think that it is a book which deals merely with outward matters. Actually, this Epistle is one of the richest books in the New Testament. First Corinthians is rich in Christ, the Spirit, the church, and life. The first two chapters contain a profound revelation of Christ. The Spirit is also clearly revealed in this book in many aspects. More aspects of the Spirit are revealed in 1 Corinthians than in any other book. Furthermore, in this Epistle Paul has much to say about the church in a very practical way. This Epistle is also rich in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="JIZ-QykqNDG1BWmM2KnMOMhZju_iNYeGTiYtb_PoJZcGOh57N2xS8o8hJ8R-wu70-"> Many of the chapters of 1 Corinthians are deep and profound. However, the most rich, deep, and profound chapters in this book are the first three chapters. In these chapters Paul uses a number of unique and significant terms and expressions. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="zjs7tyZL5uIfKl2-jisuY3zjK1KLXAhZCTehZV4aRDYk9Z7bsjPuLM57LGu0lUUp1">THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE SON OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="anLB0qPKqLGVpnELJCF3jkmpBzp5jxv0vtyn1kxcw1YQmFAHifmPHXLBQ92ZO24yM"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81572" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">1:9</span> Paul says, “God is faithful, through Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.” Do not make the mistake of thinking that the expression “the fellowship of His Son” is insignificant. Many Christians today use the word fellowship in a very common way. But in the Bible fellowship denotes a matter of great significance. In the Old Testament there was not such a thing as fellowship. At most, there was the unity of the brothers spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81573" data-verses="Psalms 133:1">Psalm 133</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81574" data-verses="Psalms 133:1">Verse 1</span> of this psalm declares, “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!” <span class="pg" data-page-id="124" id="124">[124]</span> This unity, however, is outward, whereas fellowship is inward. It is possible to have a certain kind of unity without life. For example, those who are members of a labor union may have a particular kind of unity. But such a unity is absolutely devoid of life. Fellowship requires life. Without life, we cannot have fellowship. Fellowship is an inward matter which we may describe as the intercommunication of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="b6PkOnBRxPH-JZwYqEGn8CHT8qNMfaW8DcVWx7AUwlEPRETelPUlRIL-iaR1qLEZU"> The word fellowship is used for the first time in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81575" data-verses="Acts 2:42">Acts 2:42</span>, where we are told that those who were saved and added to the church on the day of Pentecost continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles. The apostles had preached the gospel to them, and this gospel preaching brought them into something which the Bible calls fellowship. </p>
<p data-content-id="h8T7ZUYpMcEVtTeTw4Ei-WaWWau_ZtkWC0Z7ShFWsI31mZB3IXYJad2ffrJvNMmVr"> I doubt that there is in any language an equivalent of the Greek word for fellowship, <em>koinonia.</em> This word implies oneness and also a mutual flowing among the believers. When we enjoy fellowship with one another, there is a flow among us. Although electrical current is not living, it can be used to illustrate what we mean by a flow in fellowship. The flowing of electricity produces oneness. The flow, the current, we have in our spiritual fellowship involves both oneness and life. Our fellowship is a flow in oneness; it is an intercommunication among us as believers in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="UF3NSi3eZh7Dl_ZC3t8J3SGQLMJgBmML-ww7n42jfdnUmnLxDxMDWGNZfNU2kahGc"> In the New Testament, fellowship describes both the flowing between us and the Lord and between us and one another. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81576" data-verses="1John 1:3">First John 1:3</span> says, “That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.” In 1 John we have life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81577" data-verses="1John 1:1-2">1:1-2</span>) and then fellowship. There is a flow, a current, vertically between us and the Father and the Son and horizontally between us and other believers. Praise the Lord that on earth today there is something called fellowship, a fellowship among the children of God and a fellowship of the children of God with the Triune God! </p>
<p data-content-id="Mdwix_GaOy3SQn0ueCAHqoNdP1UMTDSJOyKRXvhvWkxI-OJG9yVXJjndZOAKNjsqN"> Since the day of Pentecost a current has been flowing horizontally among the believers. This flow crosses space and <span class="pg" data-page-id="125" id="125">[125]</span> time. As far as time is concerned, this fellowship has been flowing from generation to generation. As far as space is concerned, this fellowship is worldwide; it flows among believers throughout the globe. Because we are in this one flow, we cannot be separated by space. No matter where we may be, we are all in the flow; that is, we are all in the one fellowship. </p>
<p data-content-id="VAmSFImgVrwWBDh3eU1j3ZFZPnAW6HkY4I-A_aJXxzEgwGujPfsebgBAiBEiWFZI6"> According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81578" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">1:9</span>, we all have been called by God into this fellowship. Perhaps the best illustration of fellowship is the circulation of blood in the human body. Right now the blood is circulating throughout your body. In a very short period of time the blood makes one complete circuit. Life depends on this circulation. Just as there is the circulation of blood in the human body, so there is a spiritual circulation, called the fellowship, in the Body of Christ. It is a very sad thing that among a great many of today’s Christians, this circulation is either neglected or is altogether lacking. Thus, it is crucial for us to realize that in the Lord’s recovery we are being brought back into this flow, into this fellowship. </p>
<p data-content-id="imdufFGU1VpsTYYg4sAVUG-TWWELatFvUnM3HIW7L7B-Rv1HfZsOuLeAEkuDTcJUK"> From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81579" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">1:9</span> we see that through the faithful God we have been called into the fellowship of the Son of God, Jesus Christ. This indicates clearly that we have not been called into the fellowship of any denomination, practice, or theological doctrine. The unique fellowship into which God has called us is the fellowship of His Son. This means that He alone must be our fellowship. </p>
<p data-content-id="1mtnlxhyi5vxsNUaDN97plJIxKXrOz7lRpvX_h2zO2SmNPZ4cC3ocFDiy4eTOiBly"> The word fellowship in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81580" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">1:9</span> means participation. This can be proved by considering this verse in its context. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81581" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:10">Verse 10</span>, a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81582" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">verse 9</span>, says, “But I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81583" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:10">Verse 10</span> stands in contrast to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81584" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">verse 9</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81585" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">verse 9</span> Paul says that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son. Then he begins <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81586" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:10">verse 10</span> with the words, “But I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Through the name of the Lord Jesus Paul beseeches that there be no divisions among the saints. Divisions are <span class="pg" data-page-id="126" id="126">[126]</span> contrary to fellowship. They are against the fellowship into which God has called us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81587" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:11">verse 11</span> Paul continues, “For it was made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of the household of Chloe, that there are strifes among you.” The strifes mentioned in this verse are also contrary to the fellowship. </p>
<p data-content-id="9eaN6Fdd37GIAwbbB4iu5JzKVZeyCcOvYvhTi4ngEMpuLpI4URJ1klC1LrBzVosWL"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81588" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:12">verse 12</span> Paul goes on to say, “Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.” Because the Corinthians said such things, they were out of the fellowship. To say, “I am of Paul,” is to be outside the fellowship of the Son of God. Even those who said, “I am of Christ,” were not in the fellowship. </p>
<p data-content-id="jfI-61Rh_EbH_IA1gDUEXyzj4P3_cZ1Wv-AVQ0OJ9jg9A32Kw2FtbNOlkIQAhHCHk"> The Corinthians were divided by their preferences and choices. Paul, however, wanted them to realize that they had been called into one fellowship. This means that they had been called into one participation, one appreciation, one enjoyment, one preference, one choice. Those who said, “I am of Paul,” appreciated Paul and enjoyed him. The same was true of those who said that they were of Apollos or of Cephas. But the fellowship in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81589" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">1:9</span> is our participation in Christ; it is our enjoyment and appreciation of Him and our preference for Him. In these verses Paul seems to be saying to the believers at Corinth, “Don’t say that you are of this person or of that person. You all must realize that you have been called into one enjoyment, appreciation, preference, and choice. You have been called into one fellowship, and this is the Son of God as our portion. We all are in the fellowship of Christ.” </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BlFnrZica4yWuQnA7t-H0gDU5fwQYidC3QhvAc3utg7GeZB2ROy6rbjikKwq_wK8F">PAUL’S WAY OF PREACHING</h2><p data-content-id="xedXR7KyftfYy5rRtYIjXLRf-xguDXvOrdcaOEtIn7rjMRQgLiFkUjZ1Br4qBKkUQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81600" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:1">verse 1</span> Paul says, “And I, when I came to you, brothers, came not with excellence of speech or wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.” Literally, the Greek words rendered “with excellence” mean according to elevation or superiority. Paul did not come to Corinth to display excellent speech or philosophical wisdom in the testimony of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="rOrhtHgFLbPZdw3O4ue4E_N7etWmKRSVm7tw1SUd5A7IYnxmV72X7JLePRUU6vTBF"> The Greeks delighted in excellent expressions of philosophical thoughts. Paul, however, did not come to Corinth with excellence of speech or wisdom. This indicates that Paul did not preach the gospel to the Greeks according to their way of wisdom. On the contrary, he avoided such a practice. </p>
<p data-content-id="dRbM-RzPLsExpR48s2PLYESmm-66K_L4DKXbBUNLWljslgHPW3EQrzdq0rf_WG4mx"> Paul’s way of preaching the gospel was different from that common among ministers and pastors today. In Bible institutes and seminaries people are taught to preach using the psychology and philosophy of the people to whom their message is addressed. For example, those who go to Germany to preach the gospel are encouraged to learn German psychology and philosophy and to use these things in their preaching. However, when Paul went to Greece, he did not preach in this way. Paul was concerned that the cross of <span class="pg" data-page-id="132" id="132">[132]</span> Christ should not be made void through the wisdom of speech. </p>
<p data-content-id="qPvGt579Xg2208_F-Y_Px3PmmtBqvIPplfI-gGPjo8q_UxMIXkBSVMp3PZrkIuHbS"> In China I heard certain missionaries preach in the way of using Chinese ethical philosophy. Although these ministers used the name of Christ and mentioned the Bible, their speaking did not impress others either with Christ or with the Word of God. Instead, they gave the impression to the learned Chinese that the gospel actually confirmed their native philosophy. </p>

It is better that our speaking be considered awkward than that we should cause others to miss the basic matters of Christ and the cross. It is not our aim to impress people with our knowledge or speech. Instead, our burden is to impress them with Christ. We must minister Christ to them and not make a display of our language or knowledge. </p>
<p data-content-id="0lPdjYmGFHiI5J5XxCYQsri-H6UWaL3fSbomQnJY3_7MOfbRgf2qmCmeLk8UjNCJ1"> A second important point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81601" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:1">verse 1</span> concerns the testimony of God. What is the testimony of God to which Paul refers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81602" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:1">verse 1</span>? Some of the best ancient authorities have mystery instead of testimony. What the apostle announced as the testimony of God was the mystery of God, which is Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the expression of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81603" data-verses="Romans 16:25-26">Rom. 16:25-26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81604" data-verses="Colossians 1:26-27">Col. 1:26-27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81605" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">2:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81606" data-verses="Colossians 4:3">4:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81607" data-verses="Ephesians 3:4-6">Eph. 3:4-6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81608" data-verses="Ephesians 3:9">9</span>). Actually, the testimony of God and the mystery of God are one. The mystery of God is the testimony of God. This testimony, this mystery, includes Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the expression of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="7UhQ1h6ietnCG3iSYMQGeKol8eEauxoKx3uSFGoQc6bIZTcaCCwQEPzHoI6-oWcib"> Today many preach about Christ and testify of Him. But most of those who preach Christ do not care for the church. However, the full testimony of God includes both Christ and the church. Recently, in the Life-study of Exodus we saw that the ark of the testimony, a type of Christ, has measurements which are half units. These dimensions indicate that a <span class="pg" data-page-id="133" id="133">[133]</span> second half is needed. If we preach Christ without preaching the church, we give only half the message, only half of God’s testimony. The majority of today’s Christians at most have only one half of the testimony. Actually, many do not even have a complete half, for they do not have a complete Christ. In the New Testament the full testimony of God is Christ and the church. Christ is the Head, and the church is the Body. Christ is the mystery of God, and the church is the mystery of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PQd6AGHMk6jAgPz44nxU9j8ur2zdeZu1-02jXVAEy7EqNuVxyNwhicQJPFxcqffg"> When Paul came to Corinth, he announced both halves of God’s testimony; that is, he preached concerning Christ and the church. This can be proved by the contents of 1 Corinthians. In this Epistle we see both the Head and the Body. In fact, the greater portion of this book is related to the church, not directly to Christ. In the first two chapters Christ is revealed, but all the remaining chapters concentrate on the church. Most of the problems among the believers at Corinth involved the church. Therefore, Paul presents to them the complete testimony of God: Christ the Head and the church, the Body. Furthermore, he announces this testimony in simple words, not in excellence of speech with philosophical speculations. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BlFnrZica4yWuQnA7t-H0gDU5fwQYidC3QhvHP3utg7GeZB2ROy6rbjikKwq_wK8F">DETERMINING TO KNOW ONLY CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="xedXR7KyftfYy5rRtYIjXLRf-xguDXvOrdcaIX9In7rjMRQgLiFkUjZ1Br4qBKkUQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81609" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:2">verse 2</span> Paul continues, “For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.” The crucified Christ was the unique subject, the center, the content, and the substance of the apostle’s ministry. For this he determined not to know anything but the all-inclusive Christ when he was about to minister the word of the testimony of God to the excellent-speech-exalting and wisdom-worshipping Greeks. What a determination! It should be a pattern to us all. </p>
<p data-content-id="rOrhtHgFLbPZdw3O4ue4E_N7etWmKRSVm7tw8C0d5A7IYnxmV72X7JLePRUU6vTBF"> The expression “this One crucified” indicates Christ’s humiliation and abasement.

<p data-content-id="dRbM-RzPLsExpR48s2PLYESmm-66K_L4DKXbJE9LWljslgHPW3EQrzdq0rf_WG4mx"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81613" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:2">verse 2</span>, Paul determined not to know anything among the Corinthians except Christ and Him crucified. Some may appeal to this verse as a basis for arguing that Paul did not preach about the church, but only testified concerning Christ. We know from the context of the entire book of 1 Corinthians that, beginning with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81614" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span>, where Paul says that the believers are God’s farm and God’s building, Paul has much to say about the church. In this Epistle he actually speaks more about the church than about Christ. Paul’s meaning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81615" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:2">verse 2</span> is that he determined not to know philosophy, culture, doctrine, religion, or any kind of practice. He cared only for Christ. But when Paul spoke of Christ, he included the church, for Christ is the Head of the church, which is His Body. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81616" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:12">12:12</span> Paul even indicates that the church, the Body, is part of Christ. Therefore, it is not correct to say that Paul excluded the church when he declared that he determined not to know anything other than Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="QM-bErH4QMuLGtlKhNiUmVseR6-Mo4MANZWMa8ZbAWzUJ836Exkha9TFHxEakh9zT"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81617" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:2">verse 2</span> Paul seems to be saying, “Dear brothers in Corinth, you are still very philosophical, and you live a life according to your wisdom. But when I came to you ministering God’s mystery and announcing God’s testimony, I did not rely on wisdom or philosophy. I certainly did not emphasize religion or culture. I spoke to you of a living Person, the Son of God, Jesus Christ. I determined not to know anything among you except this wonderful Person. I deliberately stayed away from philosophy, wisdom, and excellence of speech.” </p>
<p data-content-id="K9Fhzhq9ETFPCPzdkFWRrkfkDyu0qmgIqwy5vjv0zVrET7fYv2qxzXlZDmd0Kk9SX"> Paul also reminded the Corinthians that the Christ he preached was One who had been crucified. On the one hand, Paul did not use excellence of speech or wisdom; on the other hand, he proclaimed not an honored, exalted, glorified Christ, but a Christ who had been despised, rejected, defeated, and even crucified. Here Paul seems to be saying, “You have believed in Christ and received Him with the initial gifts. But after receiving Christ, you made the mistake of not living a crucified life. On the contrary, you have lived a self-glorying and self-exalting life. But the One I preached to you and the One received by you was a rejected, despised, and crucified Christ. No longer should you live in a way to exalt <span class="pg" data-page-id="135" id="135">[135]</span> yourselves. Rather, you should live a crucified life, even live the crucified Christ. You should not boast in your knowledge. Instead, you should be willing to give the impression that you do not know anything other than the crucified Christ. All of you are saying that you are of Paul, of Cephas, of Apollos, or of a limited Christ. This is according to man’s way, not according to the crucified Christ. You should live this One who was crucified.” </p>
<p data-content-id="ldCSVKCXVHzwbcJAktI5qY9WW0m-zAHEbxBHBaiwzcGvha9kv82E6htYPVBgcHt9H"> There will always be trouble in a local church when the saints seek to know things other than Christ. Knowing too many doctrines often produces debates and even causes divisions. It is always profitable to know nothing but Christ and Christ crucified; this is the only safe way. </p>

But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81628" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:6">verse 6</span> he says that he speaks wisdom among those who are full-grown. When Paul wrote this Epistle, he certainly realized that the believers at Corinth were far from full-grown. Why, then, does he say that he speaks wisdom among those who are full-grown? His purpose in doing this was to belittle the Corinthians. Here Paul seems to be saying, “You Corinthians think you have <span class="pg" data-page-id="140" id="140">[140]</span> attained something great, but actually you are still babes. We do speak wisdom, but we speak wisdom among those who are full-grown. Furthermore, the wisdom we speak is not a wisdom of this age, neither of the rulers of this age.

God’s wisdom is our destiny, and this destiny was determined by God, decided by Him, beforehand. In eternity God determined our destiny. He predestined His wisdom to be for our glory. This means that in eternity He decided that His wisdom would be our destiny and glory. Our destiny is not merely the enjoyment of eternal blessings in heaven. Rather, our destiny is God’s mysterious wisdom. God has predestined His mysterious wisdom to be our glory. </p>

God in His wisdom (that is, in Christ) has ordained and prepared for us many deep and hidden things, such as justification, sanctification, and glorification. All these the human eye has never seen, the human ear has never heard, and the human heart has never realized. </p>

To understand them we need to consider the context of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81644" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">chapters one and two</span>, chapters which give us a clear view of Christ as God’s center and our portion. In these chapters Paul emphasizes the fact that Christ is God’s center and our portion. God has an economy which He desires to fulfill. This economy is His will, His purpose. The focal point of God’s economy is Christ. As the One who is the power of God and the wisdom of God in His economy, Christ is God’s unique center. God has called us into the fellowship, the participation, the mutuality, of this center. As a result, Christ as the unique center becomes the portion for our enjoyment.

The wisdom in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81650" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:7">2:7</span> is deep and profound. It is a wisdom beyond human understanding, for it is a mysterious wisdom, wisdom in a mystery. Within God there is something which Paul describes as wisdom in a mystery. This is Christ, the center of God’s economy and the portion for our enjoyment. Few ministers today preach Christ as God’s wisdom in a mystery. The majority of today’s Christians do not know Him as this mysterious wisdom. By the Lord’s mercy we are endeavoring to minister Christ and testify Him as such a wisdom in a mystery. It is helpful even to have the expression “wisdom in a mystery” in our Christian vocabulary. Praise the Lord that we see that this Christ is God’s center and our portion! </p>

In order to accomplish this, God desires to come into man to be his life so that man may live Him out. For this, God became a man through incarnation. Eventually Christ, God incarnate, died on the cross. Through His crucifixion He terminated the entire old creation. Hence, Christ’s crucifixion involved not only the death of the Lord Jesus, but the termination of everything of the old creation. By means of this all-inclusive death, the divine life, which is actually God Himself, was released and imparted to God’s predestinated, redeemed, and called people. By believing in the crucified and resurrected Christ, they have received the divine life and the divine Spirit. God’s expectation is that they will now live by this life and walk by this Spirit. This is to live Christ for the expression of God. Furthermore, such a living should not be individualistic; on the contrary, it should be corporate. Thus, God desires that His people be built together into His habitation, the Body of Christ. This is God’s intention. </p>
<p data-content-id="tiNQgxDpsd4NWazI4KY7Ls3Zc1jf31TN-mW0u0Zv7jbyJhqTUCAeHZ8B89sG6uKJy"> The believers at Corinth, most of whom were Greeks, received the initial gifts, the divine life and the divine Spirit. But after receiving these gifts, they did not live by them. They did not live by the divine life or walk by the divine Spirit. As a result, they did not live Christ. They failed to take Christ as their life, their content, and their everything. Instead, they remained in their Greek culture and exulted in <span class="pg" data-page-id="150" id="150">[150]</span> their wisdom and philosophy. This was their situation at the time Paul wrote this Epistle to them. </p>

Instead of being Greeks, you should now be Christians. You should no longer live your Greek culture, exult in your philosophy, and boast in your wisdom. You have received Christ, and God has put you into Christ. Now that God has made you Christians, you should take Christ as your life, content, and everything, and you should live Christ. Furthermore, this Christ is God’s wisdom. Greek wisdom is shallow, and it is foolishness in the sight of God. But God’s wisdom, the genuine wisdom, is deep and mysterious. It is far beyond philosophical people to comprehend this wisdom, for it is a wisdom hidden in God and is even the depths of God. This wisdom, the depths of God, is the very Christ in whom you have believed and whom you have received. I urge you to exalt this Christ, take Him as your life and everything, and live Him.” If we understand this underlying concept, it will be much easier for us to understand the first two chapters of 1 Corinthians. </p>
<p data-content-id="rOrhtHgFLbPZdw3O4ue4E_N7etWmKRSVm7Nw8A0d5A7IYnxmV72X7JLePRUU6vTBF"> Both Catholicism and Protestantism have departed from the revelation of Christ in these chapters. Catholicism has assimilated many pagan, demonic, satanic, and devilish things. The practice of Catholicism is to take in and absorb heathenism and paganism. This is documented in the book <em>The Two Babylons</em> and in the writings of G. H. Pember. Protestantism has followed the practice of adapting to local culture. As long as the elements of a culture are not sinful or idolatrous, they will be taken in by Protestantism. For example, in China many Protestant missionaries adopted Chinese ethics, and in India, they followed certain aspects of Indian culture. As a result, the so-called church in China and in India became a cultural mixture. In China I saw that the missionaries were happy when the Chinese adopted western culture. The missionaries were also willing to take <span class="pg" data-page-id="151" id="151">[151]</span> in the local culture. Therefore, Christianity in China became a mixture of Chinese culture and western culture. Apparently such a mixture is not as demonic or satanic as the paganism in Catholicism. In principle, however, both are the same, for both preach Christ, but do not help people to live Christ, to take Him as their life, living, content, and everything. </p>
<p data-content-id="dRbM-RzPLsExpR48s2PLYESmm-66K_L4DK3bJG9LWljslgHPW3EQrzdq0rf_WG4mx"> What kind of living did you have when you were in organized Christianity? Instead of living Christ, did you not live according to your culture? Surely no one taught you to live Christ, to take Christ as your life and content. Did anyone tell you to breathe Christ, drink Christ, and eat Christ? All this is foreign to most of today’s Christians. </p>
<p data-content-id="QM-bErH4QMuLGtlKhNiUmVseR6-Mo4MANZ2MZ85bAWzUJ836Exkha9TFHxEakh9zT"> In principle, the situation among believers today is the same as that among the believers in Corinth. The Corinthian believers received Christ, but they did not live Him. They did not have the concept that Christ should be their life, their living, and their content. Instead, their thoughts were focused on Greek culture, wisdom, and philosophy. Furthermore, they exulted in their wisdom and boasted in their philosophy. This caused them to think differently from one another and to have different preferences. Some preferred Paul, others preferred Cephas, and still others preferred Apollos. As a result, they were divided. This division was the root of the evil and confusion among them. </p>
<p data-content-id="K9Fhzhq9ETFPCPzdkFWRrkfkDyu0qmgIqwS5sjP0zVrET7fYv2qxzXlZDmd0Kk9SX"> The situation among Christians today is the same as that of the church at Corinth. Therefore, all Christians, including us, need this Epistle. We need to be helped by this book to drop everything other than Christ. No matter what your culture or nationality may be, you need to drop it. We all must forsake our culture, philosophy, ethics, and traditions and center on Christ as our unique portion. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ldCSVKCXVHzwbcJAktI5qY9WW0m-zAHEbxhHCbCwzcGvha9kv82E6htYPVBgcHt9H">TAKING CHRIST AS EVERYTHING</h2><p data-content-id="OT5FVjm4b3rEEp9If2G1UsfkTjficISBImgujJTvH9vLo8q-qnrQL8cvvI2WkbUHd"> Most of those believers who are baptized into a particular denomination are shaped, not according to Christ or the Bible, but according to that denomination. They speak and behave according to that particular denomination. Now that <span class="pg" data-page-id="152" id="152">[152]</span> we are in the church life in the Lord’s recovery, we should not be shaped by something other than Christ. We should have only Christ, not traditions or regulations. For example, there is a difference between a sister who does not wear makeup because she shapes herself according to the recovery and a sister who does not wear makeup because she lives Christ by walking in the spirit and calling on Him. Likewise, a brother may give up smoking because he is trying to conform himself to the practices of the recovery, or he may do so because he lives Christ and no longer has any desire to smoke. Instead of shaping ourselves according to the recovery, we should simply live Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="45d-EDyyRdejyAtIco9vv--MfBFfH5nEZ3SwQ__J1z9MAZSXg-0MsBpqMhRa6rO3L"> It is very common among Christians to have many things in place of Christ. Believers may have ethics, morality, culture, philosophy, doctrine, and tradition instead of Christ. In a very real sense, today’s Christianity is Christless. Among Christians almost anything can become a substitute for Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="oHvwn1F9kPbTytIPVynf_MGPeusawFjhQqZMyP7fRRrtjdCyM9IgKVBeI7sBRsMLT"> The underlying concept of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81667" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1-2">1 Corinthians 1 and 2</span> is that we must drop everything except Christ. When Paul came to Corinth and preached Christ, he determined not to know anything among them except Jesus Christ and this One crucified. This indicates clearly that he forsook everything except Christ. As we read 1 Corinthians, we need to be deeply impressed with this underlying thought. We need to see that we must drop everything but Christ and genuinely take Christ as everything to us. Christ truly is all-inclusive; He is everything, even the depths of God. </p>

So also, only the Spirit of God can know the deep things of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="153" id="153">[153]</span> </p>

This does not mean that Paul did not have excellence of speech or wisdom; it means that he deliberately dropped those things. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81690" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:2">verse 2</span> he goes on to say, “For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.” Paul deliberately decided not to know anything other than the crucified Christ. This implies that Paul came to the Corinthians as a crucified person. He was willing to appear foolish and not knowledgeable because he had made such a determination. </p>

We have wisdom and we can speak wisdom, but we speak wisdom only to those who are full-grown. You Corinthians are still babes. How is it possible for me to speak this wisdom to you?” </p>

This wisdom, this mystery, is Christ. Furthermore, Christ as the wisdom in a mystery has been predestined by God before the ages for our glory. Christ as the wisdom and the mystery will be our portion in glory. </p>

Every genuine Christian knows that Christ is the Savior who died on the cross for our sins. However, to know Christ in this way is to know only superficial things. What, then, are the depths? Christ as the depths of God includes such matters as God’s wisdom and mystery. </p>
<p data-content-id="A3Oa3UPcjrJzR4wlouzXCJftgWRSWHHN-LWG0osifE_yD30wsSCVCR1Rhevz1xRO7"> Before you were saved, did you know the purpose of the universe, and did you know the meaning of human life? Certainly you did not know these things. You did not know the purpose of your life on earth or what your destiny would be. Both the purpose of the universe and the meaning of your life were a mystery. Only when we receive a vision concerning Christ and experience God’s salvation can we understand the mysteries of the universe and of our life on earth. Many Christians have received Christ’s salvation, but they have not seen the vision concerning Christ. As a result, they still do not know the meaning of life. But when we see the vision of Christ in God’s economy, we begin to realize that Christ Himself is the purpose of the universe and also the meaning of our human life. We were created by God for Christ, and today we are living for Christ. Christ is our life, the purpose of our life, and also the goal of our living. Furthermore, Christ is our destiny; we are heading toward Him. When we receive such a vision concerning Christ, we begin to know the mystery of the universe and of human life. Spontaneously we become wise, for we have Christ as God’s wisdom. Then, little by little and step by step, we begin to know Christ as the depths of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="161" id="161">[161]</span> </p>

Paul speaks of these things in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81694" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:9">verse 9</span>: “But even as it is written, Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and which have not come up in man’s heart, how much God has prepared for those who love Him.” Although eye has not seen them and ear has not heard them and although they have never arisen in man’s heart, God has revealed them to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81695" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:10">v. 10</span>), and freely given them to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81696" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:12">v. 12</span>). Day by day, we see something further and deeper regarding Christ as our portion. I can testify that throughout the years, especially in the last few years, Christ has truly become the depths of God to me. </p>
<p data-content-id="PxQUR1aSfVg1g5EN0uN6GBmA7oa_DRqoHD42oLF94p-AdYjLrSH1ujpvA-dj4BNGp"> When we enjoy Christ, He becomes our righteousness. Furthermore, from experience we know that whenever we enjoy Christ, Christ becomes God’s joy to us. But when we do not experience Christ, God is not happy with us, and we do not have the joy of God. Whenever we enjoy Christ in a practical way, we have God’s joy. In fact, the Christ whom we enjoy is Himself the joy of God. At first, when we enjoy Christ, we realize that we are not righteous. Then, spontaneously, Christ becomes the righteousness we need. Then as we continue to enjoy Him, we realize that God is happy with us and that we have God’s joy. This experience is somewhat deep, but it is still not the experience of the depths of God. </p>

Then we realize that we are in the very heart, the depths, of the almighty God and that He becomes our inner element. Those who oppose the truth that we who believe in Christ are mingled with God will call this heresy because they have not experienced it. Nevertheless, I cannot deny the fact that when I enjoy Christ, I touch the depths of God and God becomes the element within me. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81700" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:10">verse 10</span> Paul speaks of the divine Spirit, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81701" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:11">verse 11</span> he goes on to speak of the human spirit: “For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him? So also the things of God no one has known except the Spirit of God.” This verse indicates that if we would know the things of man, we must use our human spirit, and if we would know the things of God, we must do so by the Spirit of God. </p>

The things of man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81702" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:11">verse 11</span> do not refer to matters such as marriage, housing, food, and transportation. It is not necessary to use the human spirit in order to know such things. These are not the things of man to which Paul refers. </p>
<p data-content-id="uEOnd0iMx5POKDetv2t0ZpmBAFDGOo1C9nJS2IjWbwDZZmpB_EzDqM1j3iDcpaIYK"> According to the Bible, what are the things of man? When the Bible first speaks of man, it tells us that man was made in the image of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81703" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Gen. 1:26</span>). The first aspect of the things of man is that man was created by God in His image in order to express Him. But the man created by God to be His expression became fallen and sinful. Most philosophers do not realize that they are fallen. But the fall of man is an important item of the things of man. As those who were created by God and who became fallen, we need to repent, we need to be saved, and we need to be regenerated. These also are things of man. Now as saved and regenerated ones, we must love the Lord, live Him, express Him, and fulfill His eternal purpose. These are more aspects of the things of man. <span class="pg" data-page-id="163" id="163">[163]</span> </p>

Although both Epistles were written by Paul, they are different in their style of composition. Romans is composed according to doctrine and reveals the truth in a doctrinal way. At the beginning of Romans there are sinners, but at the end of this book there are local churches. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81711" data-verses="Romans 1:18-32">Romans 1:18-32</span> we have a description of sinners under God’s condemnation. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81712" data-verses="Romans 16:1">Romans 16</span> we read of churches. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81713" data-verses="Romans 16:1">verse 1</span> Paul says, “I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a deaconess of the church which is at Cenchrea.” It is marvelous that those who were sinners can be justified, sanctified, and eventually go on to have the full experience and enjoyment of the Spirit as the firstfruit. As a result, they become the Body of Christ expressed in a practical way as local churches. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81714" data-verses="Romans 16:1">Romans 16</span> speaks not only of the church at Cenchrea, but also the church in the house of Prisca and Aquila (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81715" data-verses="Romans 16:5">v. 5</span>). The church in Rome met in the house of this couple. It certainly is interesting that such a doctrinal book as Romans begins with sinners and concludes with local churches. </p>

In contrast to Romans, the book of 1 Corinthians is <span class="pg" data-page-id="168" id="168">[168]</span> not a book of doctrines, but a book of practices. Nevertheless, this Epistle is quite complicated. Usually doctrinal matters are complicated. It seems that whenever and wherever we discuss doctrines, we face complications. However, it is strange that in a doctrinal book such as Romans there are no complications. For this reason, from the time I was a young Christian, I enjoyed the book of Romans because it did not have any complications. But I did not care very much for 1 Corinthians. Sometimes in my reading of the Bible I skipped over this book, wanting to avoid all the complications and problems it contains. </p>
<p data-content-id="-31E-FlFhHZVWfRVsibLPN9Po-xOz3xAwN55d9ONyImqaLANCOsF5aHepDtdpWJmP"> Examples of the complications in 1 Corinthians are found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81716" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">chapters one</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81717" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:1">five</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81718" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:1">fifteen</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81719" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:10">1:10</span> Paul beseeches the believers at Corinth that there be no divisions among them. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81720" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:11-12">verses 11 and 12</span> he proceeds to speak of strifes and divisions: “For it was made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of the household of Chloe, that there are strifes among you. Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.” To be sure, the report received by Paul concerned a complicated situation. </p>
<p data-content-id="3E2ZRbJydxokD8WKMAIbtFfHb0jzb68DhIbrormbxR9wRW14_fX2fsKcexAdJrzWM"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81721" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:1">chapter five</span> Paul deals with the gross sin of fornication. This matter is so terrible that I do not even like to talk about it. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81722" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> we learn that some of the believers claimed that there was no resurrection. By considering these three chapters we see what serious complications there were among the believers at Corinth. </p>
<p data-content-id="GBDJJALJ0cF4ks8AH19ucJjnWsP4LTnCCC4KC6XhfQlZ2XYUYk_NIq7g1JKhMOSI_"> Because 1 Corinthians involves the complications in the practice of the church life, there is a sense in which I do not like this book. But in a very different sense, I love this Epistle very much. This may appear contradictory, but it is actually a way of viewing two different aspects of this book. Many things in the Bible appear contradictory. For example, God is one, yet He is triune. The Spirit of God is one; nevertheless the book of Revelation speaks of the seven Spirits. It also seems contradictory to say that Christ is both God and man. In keeping with the principle of seeing both sides of the truth in the Bible, I can say that, when I view 1 Corinthians <span class="pg" data-page-id="169" id="169">[169]</span> from one angle, I do not like this book, but when I view it from a different angle, I like it very much. </p>

How lovable and precious is Paul’s Epistle to the Romans! It certainly is a diamond. Although I may use such an illustration to point out the great value of Romans, I have no way to illustrate the preciousness of 1 Corinthians. In a certain sense, 1 Corinthians is more precious than Romans is. </p>
<p data-content-id="EKLQNzB20IJMJNZAsXkVbasdhWNIKYBtXmH0sLgDmdSh2KIOAd4oaYB8TBbVW9IBJ"> In 1 Corinthians Paul covers many things that he does not even mention in Romans. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81723" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">1:9</span> Paul tells us that through the faithful God we have been called into the fellowship of the Son of God. Nowhere in Romans does he utter such a word. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81724" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:24">1:24</span> Paul goes on to say that to us who are called, Christ is God’s power and God’s wisdom. There is no mention of this in Romans. </p>
<p data-content-id="DeXM5GXdbazrZOx-ax9Rc0jrX8cWBb4GIcHtN5JXJuzK9JlkY0coVF7VTZZGpUzMQ"> The book of Romans reveals that we are in Christ, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81725" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Corinthians 1:30</span> Paul declares further: “But of Him you are in Christ Jesus.” Here we see that it is of God we are in Christ. Romans gives us the fact of being in Christ, but it does not say that it is of God that we are in Christ. Before you were saved, did you ever dream that you would be in Christ? Did you ever imagine that God would put you in Him? We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81726" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1:30</span> that it is altogether of God that we are now in Christ. In eternity past, before God created anything, God thought of putting us in Christ. We may even say that God had a dream concerning us, a dream that, according to the desire of His heart, we would be in Christ. Because God desired to have us, He had such a dream concerning us. Thus, it is no accident that we are in Christ. This matter was decided by God in eternity past. Whenever I consider that in eternity past God had a dream about me and decided to put me in Christ, I am beside myself with joy. Oh, it is a matter of tremendous significance that God dreamt about us in eternity! How sweet and endearing this <span class="pg" data-page-id="170" id="170">[170]</span> is! How precious is the declaration, “Of Him you are in Christ Jesus”! </p>
<p data-content-id="S4UBTaDBLhflHNtSeJetHIxvSeWeK0YxbOlFUg7ZupcAWEz0O3GGyaxAZbn0GYdQO"> In 1 Corinthians Paul also speaks of the depths of God and of drinking of the one Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81727" data-verses="Romans 11:33">Romans 11:33</span> Paul does say, “O the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God!” However, in Romans he does not mention the depths of God. Neither is there any reference in Romans to drinking of the one Spirit. These unique expressions found in 1 Corinthians are not only precious, but delightful to our taste. In Romans there are many precious things, but the precious things in 1 Corinthians are especially good to our taste. In this message we shall consider further many of the precious things found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81728" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1-2">1 Corinthians 1 and 2</span>. </p>

Have you not been puzzled by this? Why does Paul say that we cannot know the things of man apart from the spirit of man? Why is it so difficult to know the things of man? According to my concept, it was easy to know the things of man, for I thought that Paul was referring to things such as food, clothing, housing, and family life. At that time, I did not know the human spirit. Do you know what your spirit is and where it is located within you? As a young Christian I knew neither the spirit of man nor the things of man which can be known only by the spirit of man. However, I was not troubled by Paul’s word that the things of God no one has known except the Spirit of God. It seemed obvious to me that since I was not God, I could not know the things of God. I readily understood that only the Spirit of God knows the things of God. What was troublesome to me was what Paul said about the things of man and the spirit of man. </p>

So also the things of God no one has known except the Spirit of God.” If we would know the things of man and the things of God, we need the two spirits, the human spirit and the divine Spirit. Because the Corinthian believers neglected these two spirits, they could know neither the things of man nor the things of God. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81763" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:1">chapter two</span> Paul seems to be saying to them, “Corinthians, instead of relying on your philosophical mind, exercise your spirit, not your soul or your flesh. If you exercise your spirit and rely on the Spirit of God, you will know your condition, situation, position, need, and destiny. No one knows these things of man except the spirit of man. By failing to exercise the spirit and instead using your philosophical mind, you have missed the mark. You do not know the things of man, and you do not know yourselves. You do not know your situation, and you do not realize how pitiful your condition is. I urge you to exercise your spirit just as I am exercising mine. Because I exercise the spirit, I know the things concerning you. I know your position, condition, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="178" id="178">[178]</span> situation.” In dealing with the Corinthian believers Paul certainly was in the spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="XfZ84nrEImIc-Nz7b9qjdkNeXbVUzpA1tT8tCBvDe1z-Kgbse9Vggac7oUtrY8Ta8"> Something Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81764" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:21">4:21</span> makes it very clear that Paul was in spirit as he wrote to the believers at Corinth. In this verse Paul asks, “What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?” Paul was a person fully in the spirit. He could come to Corinth either with a rod or with a spirit of meekness. Because he was in the spirit, he could say, “My spirit causes me to know the things concerning you. As I exercise my spirit, I realize that you have departed from your standing in Christ, that you are ignorant of your destiny, and that you are neglecting the blessings which you have in Christ. Instead of exercising your spirit, you are exalting your philosophy and wisdom and are making choices according to your preferences. You, however, don’t know these things about yourselves, because you don’t exercise the spirit. Forget your Greek mentality and use your regenerated spirit. Then you will know the things of man, the things concerning yourselves.” </p>
<p data-content-id="k_DHJPbquZertxEnBc6g-ljfw4I_Y_ACljFdJcB2ooYdTIhcWKx_8CTD37vjRHlBO"> Paul also realized that the Corinthian believers trusted more in their philosophical wisdom than in the Spirit of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81765" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:1">chapter two</span> he seems to be telling them, “When I came to you, I did not trust in my wisdom. Although I had received an excellent education, when I was with you I determined not to know anything except Christ and Him crucified. I exercised my spirit, and I trusted in the Spirit of God. Therefore, when I was among you, I was a person in the mingled spirit. Because I am in the spirit, I know your situation, and I know the things of God. I know Christ, God’s wisdom and God’s power. I even know that God’s weakness is stronger than man’s power and that God’s foolishness is wiser than man’s wisdom. I came to know the things of God in my spirit mingled with the Spirit of God. God has even revealed the depths of God to me. I not only know the things God has done and is doing; I even know the depths of God Himself, the depths of God’s being. What I am able to do, you cannot do, because you do not rely on the two spirits, <span class="pg" data-page-id="179" id="179">[179]</span> your human spirit and the Spirit of God.” Many Christians today also neglect these two spirits. </p>
<p data-content-id="WPLFJeiDr66zP26-znBSbuxrk_rGZbWa1giyw9QagmclIUlGYx9j371es8KAwySLd"> The majority of believers hold to a doctrine of dichotomy—the belief that man is composed of two main parts, the soul and the body. According to this view, the spirit of man is identical to man’s soul. Some who teach dichotomy even claim that the spirit, the soul, the heart, and the mind are all synonymous. They say that the spirit is the soul, that the soul is the heart, and that the heart is the mind. </p>
<p data-content-id="2x5QcsCAgui9NXQYMVnCg51gf1NTLk96ExgmczHan8nZifIVz9C609J7eMcjMZTbI"> In 1954 I had a conversation with an American missionary who believed in dichotomy. At the end of a conference held in Hong Kong, he told me how much he appreciated the conference. However, he could not agree with the teaching that the human spirit is different from the human soul. He claimed that the spirit and the soul are identical. I referred him to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81766" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span>. In this verse Paul speaks of the spirit and the soul and the body, purposely using two conjunctions. I asked him how, on the basis of this verse, he could insist that the soul and the spirit are synonymous. Nevertheless, he still held to the view that the soul and the spirit are the same. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="uEOnd0iMx5POKDetv2t0ZpmBAFDGOo1C-lJS1IDWbwDZZmpB_EzDqM1j3iDcpaIYK">TWO EXTREMES</h2><p data-content-id="fonV3HEy2MU2N2I0YaxDvgIBiUxgNE7RVjjm88oXAqnMbBjw-ecpzlsiH3gTPoymz"> Many believers do not have an adequate understanding of the Spirit of God. Certain fundamentalists emphasize doctrine. In many cases they are even afraid of talking about the Spirit. They do not pay proper attention to the two spirits in the New Testament. In particular they do not place the proper emphasis on the two spirits in the Epistles of Paul. Thus, the fundamentalists represent one extreme with respect to the Spirit of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp5nPlbgQrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen"> Certain Christians in the Pentecostal movement or charismatic movement represent another extreme, for they overemphasize particular gifts of the Spirit, such as healing and speaking in tongues. The situation among many of these Christians is very similar to that of the believers in Corinth: they place too much emphasis on tongues and miracles. In many cases, the supposed occurrences of speaking in tongues <span class="pg" data-page-id="180" id="180">[180]</span> and healing are not genuine. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81767" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span>, speaking in tongues must be the speaking of a language or dialect. Genuine tongues-speaking does not consist of the mere repetition of sounds. If the so-called speaking in tongues practiced in many charismatic groups today were recorded and studied by a linguist, the linguist would conclude that the sounds uttered are not that of any language or dialect. </p>
<p data-content-id="HGln5zZ0kg7BRF2G3k4ch5kayK9fIchfO5oVVifWdxC7j7vo-3Hmf4N_nWwoJM4tK"> In some charismatic meetings neither the tongues-speaking nor the interpretation of the tongues is genuine. For example, someone may utter certain sounds, which are given a particular interpretation. On another occasion, the same person may utter the same sounds, but they are given an altogether different interpretation. On one occasion, the interpretation may be an exhortation to be humble before the Lord, whereas on another occasion, the interpretation may be a word about an earthquake or the Lord’s coming. Certain believers devote much attention to the exercise of so-called spiritual gifts without any attempt to discern what is genuine from what is false. </p>
<p data-content-id="XfZ84nrEImIc-Nz7b9qjdkNeXbVUzpA1tT8tLSvDe1z-Kgbse9Vggac7oUtrY8Ta8"> In some Christian groups there is great emphasis on miraculous healing. I once attended a healing campaign in Manila purposely to see if there were any cases of genuine healing. In the meeting I attended there was not one instance of a real healing. Some claimed to be healed, but eventually this supposed healing was proved to be merely a psychological phenomenon. There was no permanent cure. After a period of time, everyone who was supposedly healed in that meeting was the same as before. </p>
<p data-content-id="k_DHJPbquZertxEnBc6g-ljfw4I_Y_ACljFdBPR2ooYdTIhcWKx_8CTD37vjRHlBO"> The claim has been made in some Pentecostal groups that in their meetings people’s teeth have been filled with gold miraculously. I absolutely do not believe such reports. Why would God not restore the teeth instead of filling them with gold? That would be more in agreement with the principle in the Bible. Furthermore, if such miracles had actually taken place, newsmen would learn of them and publicize them. </p>

So also the things of God no one has known except the Spirit of God.” By this verse we see that the spirit of man knows the things of man, and the Spirit of God knows the things of God. The spirit of man is the deepest part of his being. It is the faculty that can penetrate the innermost region of the things of man, whereas the mind of man is capable only of knowing superficial things. So also, only the Spirit of God can know the things of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0lPdjYmGFHiI5J5XxCYQsri-H6UWaL3fRaomW1ZY3_7MOfbRgf2qmCmeLk8UjNCJ1">USING THE RIGHT ORGAN</h2><p data-content-id="7UhQ1h6ietnCG3iSYMQGeKol8eEauxoKy2uSMVIQc6bIZTcaCCwQEPzHoI6-oWcib"> In order to substantiate something we need to use the proper organ. For example, we substantiate sounds by the sense of hearing. But suppose someone is speaking and you exercise your sense of smell instead of your sense of hearing. In such a case you will not realize anything and may come to the conclusion that nothing is taking place. Actually, someone is speaking, but you are using the wrong organ to substantiate what he is saying. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PQd6AGHMk6jAgPz44nxU9j8ur2zdeZu2_02rElAEy7EqNuVxyNwhicQJPFxcqffg"> An argument between a husband and wife can also illustrate the mistake of using the wrong organ. A brother may be very unhappy with his wife and offended in his emotion <span class="pg" data-page-id="188" id="188">[188]</span> by her attitude toward him. But if he turns from his emotion to his spirit through the exercise of his will, his feeling will change. Instead of condemning his wife and being offended with her, he will understand her in an altogether different way. From these examples we see that it matters very much that we use the proper organs in dealing with various matters. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="eUZwTHuTDFPfNYOCu1n50UUorE6pAtRKL_vM5-aY_zFf532UtF6kNi_wohlwMw9hh">THE SPIRIT AND THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="5cvwE7fG0BCj-rNo6NGmlSxcfn8js06QBIiHjBiKtAHd3P8c8SI8FsHkl6iaraK0i"> It is especially important that we use the proper organ—the human spirit—to know spiritual things. However, concerning the experience of Christ and the church, most Christians have been taught to know Christ and the church by the exercise of the mind and with traditional teachings as the basis. Some denominations even conduct seminars in which people are trained to use their mentality to solve problems among Christians. Furthermore, that training is based not on the pure Word of God, but on tradition. Thus, instead of using the spirit, the majority of Christians use their natural mind to understand, analyze, visualize, and philosophize. Furthermore, the basis for this mental activity is tradition, not the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="N9DQWvp40eBT2VybP3ap72SyWkeUtkAvkC_yCQS_h8YrqVB4HFvlImtcJ6D_lT9Tg"> This practice has caused many believers to make serious mistakes in their understanding of the experience of Christ. For example, one well-known Christian teacher has said in writing that Christ does not actually dwell in us, but is only in the heavens and is represented in us by the Holy Spirit. This is a clear case of exercising the mind according to traditional doctrine and theology to understand the experience of Christ. According to the Bible, Christ is both in the heavens and in the believers. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81774" data-verses="John 14:17">John 14:17</span> the Lord Jesus says concerning the Spirit of reality, “You know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.” Here the Lord says explicitly that the Spirit of reality will be in us. When we compare <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81775" data-verses="John 14:17-18">verses 17 and 18</span>, we see that the very He who is the Spirit of reality in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81776" data-verses="John 14:17">verse 17</span> becomes the very I who is the Lord Himself in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81777" data-verses="John 14:18">verse 18</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81778" data-verses="John 14:18">verse 18</span> the Lord goes on to say, “I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.” This <span class="pg" data-page-id="189" id="189">[189]</span> surely does not refer to Christ’s second coming. If it did refer to Christ’s second coming, then all the Christians from the first century until now would have been orphans. </p>
<p data-content-id="tiNQgxDpsd4NWazI4KY7Ls3Zc1jf31TN9n20omJv7jbyJhqTUCAeHZ8B89sG6uKJy"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81779" data-verses="John 14:19">verse 19</span> the Lord declares, “Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you shall live also.” The words “a little while” certainly do not refer to the nineteen hundred years that have gone by since the Lord’s first coming. By this expression the Lord did not mean a period of years or even weeks. The Lord was indicating here that He was about to be crucified and buried. For this reason, the world would see Him no longer. However, just three days later, on the day of His resurrection, His disciples would behold Him. First the Lord was seen by Mary in the morning and then by a group of His disciples in the evening. Thus, it was after a little while that they beheld Him, although the world beheld Him no longer. </p>
<p data-content-id="h8T7ZUYpMcEVtTeTw4Ei-WaWWau_ZtkWB1J7SgFWsI31mZB3IXYJad2ffrJvNMmVr"> At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81780" data-verses="John 14:19">verse 19</span> the Lord Jesus says, “Because I live, you shall live also.” This indicates that He will live in us and cause us to live by Him. Hence, the Lord seems to be saying, “I will come into you and live in you and cause you to live by Me.” This began to take place on the night of His resurrection. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81781" data-verses="John 20:19">John 20:19</span> says, “When therefore it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, Peace be to you.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81782" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>, “He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.” By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord imparted Himself as life and everything into them. In this way, all that He had spoken in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81783" data-verses="John 14:1">chapters fourteen through sixteen</span> could be fulfilled. After the Lord breathed the Holy Spirit into the disciples, He disappeared from their sight. But from that time onward the resurrected Christ began to live within them and to cause them to live by Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="UF3NSi3eZh7Dl_ZC3t8J3SGQLMJgBmML9xg7n52jfdnUmnLxDxMDWGNZfNU2kahGc"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81784" data-verses="John 14:20">John 14:20</span> the Lord says, “In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.” This day is the day of the Lord’s resurrection. Here the Lord does not say, “In that day you will know that I am in the heavens <span class="pg" data-page-id="190" id="190">[190]</span> and that you are on earth.” Nevertheless, this is the traditional teaching held by many Christians. The Lord says definitely, “You shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.” The Lord says nothing here concerning being represented in them by the Holy Spirit. He says clearly, “I in you.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Mdwix_GaOy3SQn0ueCAHqoNdP1UMTDSJNzaRXuhvWkxI-OJG9yVXJjndZOAKNjsqN"> Based upon the revelation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81785" data-verses="John 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> of John, the Lord Jesus says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81786" data-verses="John 15:4">John 15:4</span>, “Abide in Me and I in you.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81787" data-verses="John 15:5">verse 5</span> He continues, “I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.” Here the Lord speaks not simply of being in us, but of abiding in us as we abide in Him. To abide means to stay, to remain. Christ abides in us; He remains in us. This is not representation, but the abiding in us of Christ Himself. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VAmSFImgVrwWBDh3eU1j3ZFZPnAW6HkY7JuA_bJXxzEgwGujPfsebgBAiBEiWFZI6">HOLDING BOTH ASPECTS OF THE TRUTH</h2><p data-content-id="imdufFGU1VpsTYYg4sAVUG-TWWELatFvXmc3HLW7L7B-Rv1HfZsOuLeAEkuDTcJUK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81788" data-verses="John 14:23">John 14:23</span> the Lord Jesus says, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.” Here the Lord says that the Father and the Son will come to the one who loves the Lord and make Their abode with him. However, traditional Christian teaching is contrary to this. First, there is an emphasis on the fact that after His resurrection Christ ascended to the heavens. Second, it is also emphasized that, after His ascension, Christ sent the Holy Spirit of God upon the church. With these concepts as the basis, the traditional teachings, stressing only one side of the truth, say that Christ is now in the heavens and that the Holy Spirit is on earth representing Him in the believers. However, this traditional view altogether neglects the clear word of the Bible concerning Christ’s indwelling. The Bible reveals both that Christ is in heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81789" data-verses="Romans 8:34">Rom. 8:34</span>) and also that He is actually in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81790" data-verses="Romans 8:10">Rom. 8:10</span>). Concerning this, we need to believe and hold both aspects of the truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="1mtnlxhyi5vxsNUaDN97plJIxKXrOz7lSo_X_i2zO2SmNPZ4cC3ocFDiy4eTOiBly"> In the last century Robert Govett wrote a book entitled <em>The Twofoldness of Divine Truth.</em> Like virtually everything else, the divine truth in the Bible has two sides. Concerning <span class="pg" data-page-id="191" id="191">[191]</span> Christ, one side of the truth is that Christ has ascended to the heavens and has sent down the Holy Spirit. But the other side of the divine truth is that Christ Himself is actually within us. </p>

Paul did not use superficial expressions with regard to the church; here he speaks of the church by using deep and profound expressions. In this chapter Paul uses three main terms for the church: the farm, the building, and the temple. </p>
<p data-content-id="45d-EDyyRdejyAtIco9vv--MfBFfH5nEa2CwZs_J1z9MAZSXg-0MsBpqMhRa6rO3L"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81794" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">verse 9</span> Paul says, “You are God’s farm, God’s building.” The Greek word rendered farm in this verse literally means cultivated land. The believers who have been regenerated in Christ with God’s life are God’s cultivated land, a farm in God’s new creation to grow Christ, that precious materials may be produced for God’s building. Hence, we are not only God’s farm, but also God’s building. Corporately, we as the church of God have Christ planted in us. Christ must also grow in us, and out of us He must produce, in the sense of this chapter, not the fruit, but the precious materials of gold, silver, and precious stones for the building of God’s habitation on earth. Thus, the building of God, the house of God, the church, is the increase of Christ, the enlargement of Christ in His unlimitedness. </p>

If anyone destroys the temple of God, God shall destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, <span class="pg" data-page-id="196" id="196">[196]</span> which you are.” A temple of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81796" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:16">verse 16</span> refers to the believers collectively in a certain locality, as in Corinth, whereas the temple of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81797" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:17">verse 17</span> refers to all the believers universally. The unique, spiritual temple of God in the universe has its expressions in many localities on earth. Each expression is a temple of God in that locality. </p>

The temple is the building, and the building is produced by the materials grown on the farm. Thus, we have the farm, the building, and the temple. God’s building is not an ordinary building; it is the sanctuary of the holy God, the temple in which the Spirit of God dwells. We, the builders of such a holy temple, should realize this so that we may be careful to build not with the worthless materials of wood, grass, and stubble, but with the precious materials of gold, silver, and precious stones (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81799" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:12">v. 12</span>), which correspond to God’s nature and economy. </p>

We have seen that in the first two chapters Paul has much to say about Christ. The problems among the believers at Corinth were caused by their lack of experience of Christ. For this reason, Paul begins this Epistle with Christ and then continues with the church. </p>

Likewise, if we have Christ, we should be in the church. Christ and the church cannot be divided, just as a person’s head should not be separated from his body. To separate the head from the body is to bring death to the body. Therefore, we should never separate Christ from the church or the church from Christ. </p>

We all know that the purpose of a farm is to produce food for us to eat. A building is a <span class="pg" data-page-id="197" id="197">[197]</span> structure made of certain materials. Apparently, a farm is not related to a building, for a farm produces food for eating, not materials for building. No one would build a house with the produce grown on a farm. Farm products seemingly are not useful for building. Nevertheless, the farm in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81800" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">verse 9</span> is for the building.

They have been planted by the ministers of Christ, God’s fellow-workers, they have been watered by other ministers, also God’s fellow-workers, and they are made to grow in life by God Himself. We become members of the church not by the way of joining a social organization, but by being planted. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81802" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:6">verse 6</span> Paul says, “I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow.” Paul planted the believers at Corinth into the church, which is God’s farm, so that they might grow Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="7UhQ1h6ietnCG3iSYMQGeKol8eEauxoKy2eSFFoQc6bIZTcaCCwQEPzHoI6-oWcib"> It is a very significant matter to be a plant on God’s farm. There is no need on the farm for a teacher to instruct the plants. A plant does not need anyone to tell it what to do or how to grow. However, among Christians today a great deal of teaching is given to the plants. Actually, the believers are regarded not as plants, but as students, as learners. Before I came into the church life, I was a “student” in the Brethren assembly. Although I learned a great deal about the Bible, I was dying for the lack of life. Instead of living like a plant, I was living like a student. I am even concerned that in some local churches there is a school instead of a farm. There may be teaching, but very little watering of the plants. We all should practice the church life in the way of farming, in the way of planting, watering, cultivating, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="198" id="198">[198]</span> trimming. We must learn when to water the saints, when to feed them, and when to trim them. </p>

This indicates that the believers are God’s farm to grow Christ. As plants on God’s farm, the church, we need to grow. Without growth, we are useless. Some of the plants in my garden at home are living, but they do not grow. In like manner, there are many believers today who are alive spiritually, but they do not grow. Of course, it is better to live than to die. As long as we are alive, we have the opportunity to grow. I hope that no one in the Lord’s recovery will be content to live without growing. We all must grow to produce Christ. All the saints in the Lord’s recovery must be desperate to grow. We should pray, “Lord, grant me the growth.” </p>

However, the church is not built with the objective Christ, with a Christ who is in the heavens or who suddenly descends from the heavens.

Thus, for the building of the church, we must have the Christ who is produced through our growth in life. </p>

When life is imparted to a person dead in sins, he becomes a living plant. Because Paul imparted life to the Corinthians, he was their father in Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81810" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:15">4:15</span> he says, “For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.” Before Paul came to Corinth, the Corinthians were not plants. On the contrary, they were dead sinners. But when Paul visited them, he imparted life to them, and they became living plants. This is the first aspect of planting. </p>
<p data-content-id="eUZwTHuTDFPfNYOCu1n50UUorE6pAtRKL_PMws6Y_zFf532UtF6kNi_wohlwMw9hh"> The second aspect of planting is to bring the living plants into contact with the proper soil and to place them in the soil. To be sure, the right soil in which the plants may grow is the church life. On the one hand, we need to learn how to impart Christ into sinners through the preaching of the gospel in life. When Christ is imparted into others, they become living plants. On the other hand, we need to put these plants into the proper soil, the church life. These two things together constitute the planting. <span class="pg" data-page-id="204" id="204">[204]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5cvwE7fG0BCj-rNo6NGmlSxcfn8js06QBICHrTSKtAHd3P8c8SI8FsHkl6iaraK0i">A MATTER OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="imdufFGU1VpsTYYg4sAVUG-TWWELatFvXm83HJW7L7B-Rv1HfZsOuLeAEkuDTcJUK"> Planting, watering, and making to grow are all related to the matter of life. This indicates clearly that the believers are God’s farm to grow Christ. The ministers of Christ can plant and water. God is the only One who can make to grow. The Corinthian believers overestimated the planter and the waterer, but neglected the One who makes to grow. Hence, they did not grow in Christ as their life. </p>
<p data-content-id="1mtnlxhyi5vxsNUaDN97plJIxKXrOz7lSofX_g2zO2SmNPZ4cC3ocFDiy4eTOiBly"> The Corinthian believers, under the influence of Greek philosophical wisdom, paid too much attention to knowledge and neglected life. In this chapter Paul’s aim is to turn their attention from knowledge to life, pointing out to them that he is a feeder and a planter, Apollos is a waterer, and God is the Giver of growth. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81811" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:15">4:15</span> he even tells them that he is their spiritual father, who begot them in Christ through the gospel. From the view of life, the divine view, they are God’s farm to grow Christ. This is totally a matter of life, a matter which is utterly missed by believers who are dominated by their soulish, natural life under the influence of their natural wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="9eaN6Fdd37GIAwbbB4iu5JzKVZeyCcOvbuRTi5ngEMpuLpI4URJ1klC1LrBzVosWL"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81812" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:7">verse 7</span> Paul says, “So that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One Who makes to grow, God.” As far as the growth in life is concerned, all the ministers of Christ, whether a planter or a waterer, are nothing, and God is everything. We must turn our eyes from them to God alone. This delivers us from the divisiveness which results from appreciating one minister of Christ above another. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jfI-61Rh_EbH_IA1gDUEXyzj4P3_cZ1Ws_wVQ1OJ9jg9A32Kw2FtbNOlkIQAhHCHk">PLANTING, WATERING, AND GROWTH</h2><p data-content-id="TgPV7WYzePxLg1dlN-g0NWu5ni7DunVU23z8poU42YLj5QKtSQNXUKE8xxgPy_6YT"> In the church life we must learn not only how to plant, but also how to water. Actually, watering others is very easy. Suppose a saint comes to you with a problem. Do not try to solve this person’s problem. Actually, we are not able to solve others’ problems. Do you not have many problems of your own which are not yet solved? Since you have not solved your own problems, how do you expect to help others with their problems? Thus, in watering the saints, we should forget <span class="pg" data-page-id="205" id="205">[205]</span> about trying to solve their problems. According to my experience, the best way to water others is to pray-read a few verses with them. For example, a brother may present a problem concerning his job or family life. Instead of touching the problem, pray-read the Word with him. If you do this, both of you will be watered. You will know that the one who came to you has been watered by the fact that you yourself have been watered. Your consciousness of having been watered proves that you have watered him. </p>
<p data-content-id="nHflLWyF2nFg6U3Z-4mUTN0kfws3Baz2DR5bi0FTEzR-CESxOjvQhJ575ytY-yo5S"> In our contact with others a great deal of time is wasted by vain talk. Problems cannot be solved by talking. Even if you are able to solve someone’s problem, this will not supply him with life or water him. Instead, it will kill him. I repeat, we should not try to solve the problems of others. The more we try to solve problems, the more problems there will be, and the more others will be killed by our efforts. </p>
<p data-content-id="6nl9vMoAoMK12zKD0K5y_Gx6eSA-Vnhw1UwnCL_a_w2PSkAV7X6WzBuN8UC31SJbX"> Instead of becoming involved with problems, we should be simple in our contact with those who come to us for fellowship. God is our Father, and eventually He will take care of all the problems. The crucial matter is the watering. We have pointed out that by pray-reading with another saint, we can water him. Sometimes it is sufficient simply to pray with that one. By praying the other person is brought to the Lord, and we are brought into the Lord in a deeper way. As a result, both parties are watered. This is a very practical way of watering the saints in the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="RKpt0z8nFNlHi_3vAHu8OcgGgYOj-shs6G-S2ubEU8dkYiKR-u6Z0ZA1R2xXn3ai4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81813" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:6-7">verses 6 and 7</span> Paul speaks not only of planting and watering, but also of growing. Paul emphasizes the fact that it is God alone who makes to grow. The growth on God’s farm produces the materials for God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="sekrxE0ekH4YzjuJnZ6t8c3cdplKbmWoY5itdcsSkFLy5jYO71G6nuPBp_WYYIECE"> Since it is God who makes to grow, we must leave the matter of growth to Him. Our responsibility is to plant and water, not to help others grow. If we try to help others grow, we overstep our responsibility. It is beyond our capacity to cause the saints to grow. None of us can produce growth in other believers. Not even Paul was able to make the saints grow. He was very clear that we can plant and water, but only God gives the growth. <span class="pg" data-page-id="206" id="206">[206]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="wIQrvVteeI1oKV87cJZVVv5dOgX231XUto1UyRHr25XvLEhXjHSjbC3_2HzXXD3x4"> While we are planting and watering, we need to have the assurance with faith that God will make to grow. We need to believe that God is here and that He will cause whatever we plant and water to grow. If we have this assurance, we shall not try to help others grow. </p>
<p data-content-id="LCOBHh-_8rtpkoOSBhuJ3SLJouiGtADmQcrcFmbK7WCcffclCOEo5EYkos9Kc9G0W"> If we try to help other plants grow, we may damage them and pluck them up. I once read of a little boy who was bothered by the fact that the grass near his house was not growing very well. Wanting to help the grass grow, he plucked up many blades of grass. As a result, instead of growing, the grass died. What this little boy did to the grass illustrates what some saints are doing in the church life today. The elders in some churches are not planting and watering; instead, in their efforts to help the saints to grow, they are plucking them up. But the more the elders help in this way, the less the plants grow. </p>
<p data-content-id="mA_96h-ZPzHjy0DOYoWw3UVdng1dAcNQLY60ges6FnoHymfKQciucRWHW48k6Jjdb"> It is important for us to have the full assurance that when we plant and water, God will make to grow. Thus, after planting and watering, we should be at rest and not try to help others grow. Growth is not of us; it is altogether of God. Through the church life and our watering, God will supply the plants and enable them to grow. As long as the saints remain in the church life and are watered, God will make them grow. </p>

A spiritual man is one who does not behave according to the flesh or act according to the soulish life, but lives according to the spirit, that is, his spirit mingled with the Spirit of God. Such a one is dominated, governed, directed, moved, and led by such a mingled spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="jfI-61Rh_EbH_IA1gDUEXyzj4P3_cZ1Ws-AVYneJ9jg9A32Kw2FtbNOlkIQAhHCHk"> The term fleshy is a stronger expression than fleshly in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81837" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:3">verse 3</span>, and it refers to aspects of the flesh that are more gross.

<p data-content-id="7UhQ1h6ietnCG3iSYMQGeKol8eEauxoKy3-SFHoQc6bIZTcaCCwQEPzHoI6-oWcib"> This book reveals clearly that a believer may be one of three kinds of men: a spiritual man, living in his spirit under the anointing of the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81840" data-verses="Romans 8:4">Rom. 8:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81841" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">Gal. 5:25</span>); a soulish man, living in his soul under the direction of the soul, the natural life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81842" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:14">2:14</span>); or a fleshy and fleshly man, of the flesh and living in the flesh under the influence of the nature of the flesh. The Lord desires that all His believers may take His grace to be the first kind of man—a spiritual man. This is the goal of this book—to motivate the Corinthian believers who are soulish, fleshy, and fleshly to aspire to the growth in life that they may become spiritual (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81843" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:15">2:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81844" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">3:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81845" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:37">14:37</span>).

When we live in the soul or in the flesh, we are missing the mark of participating in Him. </p>

Although they had received all the initial gifts in life and were lacking in none of them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81850" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:7">1:7</span>), they had not grown in life after receiving them, but rather remained as infants in Christ, not spiritual but fleshy. The apostle here points out their deficiency and indicates their need, that is, to grow in life to maturity, to be full grown (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81851" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:6">2:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81852" data-verses="Colossians 1:28">Col. 1:28</span>). </p>

But neither yet now are you able.” To give milk to drink or food to eat is to feed others. Feeding refers to the matter of life. This differs from teaching, which refers to knowledge. What the apostle ministered to the Corinthian believers seemed to <span class="pg" data-page-id="213" id="213">[213]</span> be knowledge. Actually it was milk (not yet solid food), and it should have nourished them. Milk is mainly for infants, whereas solid food is for the mature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81854" data-verses="Hebrews 5:12">Heb. 5:12</span>). The fact that the Corinthian believers could not receive solid food indicates that they were not growing in life. </p>

For whereas there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and walking according to man?” Jealousy and strife are expressions, characteristics, of the nature of the flesh. Hence, they characterize those who are in the flesh, those who are fleshly. Every fallen human being is the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81856" data-verses="Romans 3:20">Rom. 3:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81857" data-verses="Galatians 2:16">Gal. 2:16</span>).

Instead of walking according to the natural man, we should walk according to the mingled spirit. However, in saying that they were of Paul or of Apollos, the Corinthians were walking according to the fallen natural man. They were not living and behaving according to the Spirit in their regenerated human spirit. </p>

I am one with Apollos, and Apollos is one with me. Why do you try to divide us? Why do some of you say that you are of him and others say that you are of me? To speak in this way is to be divisive. Apollos and I are one in the God-given ministry. I planted and he watered, but we both share in the one ministry. Furthermore, each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor. We are God’s fellow-workers, and you are God’s farm, God’s building.” </p>

The most necessary thing for a plant is growth. The Corinthian believers were not lacking in the initial gifts in life—the eternal life and <span class="pg" data-page-id="214" id="214">[214]</span> the Holy Spirit—but they were desperately short in the growth in life. The initial gifts were given for the purpose of growth and development. </p>
<p data-content-id="OT5FVjm4b3rEEp9If2G1UsfkTjficISBLmQujKTvH9vLo8q-qnrQL8cvvI2WkbUHd"> Many Christians today do not realize that they have received the initial gifts in life and that they urgently need the growth in life. The matter most neglected among believers is the initial gifts for the growth in life. I hope that many among us, especially the young ones, will realize that they have the divine life and the Holy Spirit within them as the initial gifts and that these gifts need growth and development. </p>
<p data-content-id="45d-EDyyRdejyAtIco9vv--MfBFfH5nEa3iwT-fJ1z9MAZSXg-0MsBpqMhRa6rO3L"> The Corinthian believers had received the initial gifts of life as the seed. This means that the seed had been sown into their being, and that their being was the earth in which the seed would grow. But although they had received the seed, they still needed the growth in life for the development of the gifts they had received. </p>

The gifts in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81861" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:7">1:7</span> are different from those in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81862" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapters twelve</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81863" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">fourteen</span>. The gifts in these chapters are not the initial gifts. Rather, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81864" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapters twelve</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81865" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">fourteen</span> we have both miraculous gifts and mature gifts. Genuine tongues-speaking is a miraculous gift. For example, it certainly was a miracle for Balaam’s donkey to speak a human language. Although that may be called a gift, it certainly was not the initial gift in life. Believers may be amazed at the manifestation of a miraculous gift, but they may consider the initial gifts of eternal life and of the Holy Spirit very common and not worthy of much attention. However, even though the miraculous gifts have their source in God, they actually do not count as much as the initial gifts. No doubt, it was of God that Balaam’s donkey spoke in tongues. But this miraculous occurrence did not render either the donkey or Balaam very much help in life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="215" id="215">[215]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="mA_96h-ZPzHjy0DOYoWw3UVdng1dAcNQLZa0lMc6FnoHymfKQciucRWHW48k6Jjdb"> If the saints in a particular locality are short of the growth of life, they cannot have the proper church life. Actually, the reality of the church does not exist among them. Yes, they are a local church in name, but they do not have the reality of the church. The church exists as a gathering of saved people, but it cannot be considered a reality in the growth of life and in the experience and enjoyment of Christ. Furthermore, where the growth of life is lacking, the believers’ Christian life will be a mess, the church life will be damaged, and the Body life will be destroyed. This was exactly the situation in Corinth. Although the Corinthian believers had received the initial gifts, they had not grown in life. Instead, they merely had the divine life and the Holy Spirit sown into them as seeds. Because they did not have the normal growth in life, they did not have the proper Christian life, church life, and Body life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zjyvva9_mwbWU7v14CMragfkXMl76M85BJ4Yili2npxvRcj28K_niY4FY2FqTLVIx"> Realizing the situation among the Corinthians, Paul does not speak of the church in a doctrinal way, but in the way of life, in the way of feeding, watering, and growing. Only if the Corinthians grew in life could the reality of the church exist <span class="pg" data-page-id="220" id="220">[220]</span> among them through the experience of Christ and only then could the Body life be built up. </p>

Again and again we have pointed out that the initial gifts, the gifts believers receive at the time they are saved, include the divine life and the Holy Spirit. Miraculous gifts include such things as healing and speaking in tongues. When Balaam’s donkey spoke a human language, that certainly was a miraculous occurrence, a true instance of speaking in tongues. A creature that did not even possess human life actually spoke a human language. The tongues-speaking in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81877" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapters twelve</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81878" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">fourteen</span> refers to the speaking of an actual language which a person has not learned. Suddenly, under the divine power, a believer miraculously speaks another language. This is genuine tongues-speaking. This kind of miraculous gift does not require the growth in life as the mature gifts do. </p>
<p data-content-id="wIQrvVteeI1oKV87cJZVVv5dOgX231XUtpVUyTHr25XvLEhXjHSjbC3_2HzXXD3x4"> Genuine tongues-speaking is different from the so-called speaking in tongues practiced today, where people utter sounds and syllables which have nothing to do with any actual language. If these sounds were recorded and analyzed by a linguist, it would be proved that they are not part of any language or dialect. </p>
<p data-content-id="LCOBHh-_8rtpkoOSBhuJ3SLJouiGtADmQdLcGm7K7WCcffclCOEo5EYkos9Kc9G0W"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81879" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapters twelve</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81880" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">fourteen</span> Paul mentions both speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues. Among Pentecostal and charismatic groups, there are many supposed instances of speaking in tongues with interpretation. However, in many cases these are not genuine. For example, in a meeting someone may speak certain sounds or syllables which will then be interpreted in a particular way. In another meeting the same person may utter the same sounds; however, they are given a different interpretation. Thus, the same sounds have two interpretations. Such a thing is not a genuine miraculous gift. On the contrary, it is natural and of human invention. <span class="pg" data-page-id="221" id="221">[221]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="mA_96h-ZPzHjy0DOYoWw3UVdng1dAcNQLZa0jeM6FnoHymfKQciucRWHW48k6Jjdb"> There can be no doubt that healing is a miraculous gift. The gift of healing mentioned by Paul is truly miraculous. But in the healing campaigns conducted by Christians today there are many false healings. In many of these campaigns, there is not one case of a genuine miraculous healing. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zjyvva9_mwbWU7v14CMragfkXMl76M85BJ4Yr2C2npxvRcj28K_niY4FY2FqTLVIx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81881" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapters twelve</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81882" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">fourteen</span> we also have another category of gifts, the mature gifts. Prophesying is one of these mature gifts. To prophesy is better than to speak in tongues because speaking in tongues does not build up the church, but prophesying does build up the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81883" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:4">14:4</span>). We all should seek those gifts, especially prophesying, which build up the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="A3Oa3UPcjrJzR4wlouzXCJftgWRSWHHN9IGG0psifE_yD30wsSCVCR1Rhevz1xRO7"> If we would prophesy for the building up of the church, we must have the experience in life.

<p data-content-id="F_0pIc17fjqQrLFCajrHceBnEm3EkINB7p4u9MMW-twLqCp0pOLPqCxrSvbNiuAOt"> The gift of prophecy in 1 Corinthians is different from that commonly practiced in charismatic groups today. For example, many years ago some prophesied that a great earthquake would destroy the city of Los Angeles. Usually, such so-called prophecies conclude, in Old Testament fashion, with the words, “Thus saith the Lord.” But in 1 Corinthians prophesying means to speak for Christ and even to speak forth Christ. If we would speak forth Christ, we must first experience Christ. Only when we have the genuine experience of Christ can we minister Him to the church. Thus, to prophesy by speaking forth Christ requires experience. Among the Corinthians there may have been a number of miraculous gifts, but they were short of the mature gifts, such as the gift of prophesying for the building up of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="CFF3xQmaFvwJ5j4xk2Wr_M9AHisFFvvZGx4jhvlhhQwaE4qISeDhS6DHqSHn3a8XL"> In 1 Corinthians we also have the gift of ruling, or of taking the lead. Such a gift is based on maturity. We cannot expect that a young saint should be able to be a leading one. Taking the lead requires a certain amount of maturity. Actually, this gift is related to eldership. An elder is one who <span class="pg" data-page-id="222" id="222">[222]</span> is not a babe. On the contrary, he must be a person with some maturity. </p>
<p data-content-id="PxQUR1aSfVg1g5EN0uN6GBmA7oa_DRqoEAo2oIF94p-AdYjLrSH1ujpvA-dj4BNGp"> The believers at Corinth were lacking in the mature gifts. In particular, they were short of the gift to speak forth Christ that the church may be supplied and built up, and short of the gift of proper leadership. They had received the initial gifts, but not many among them had grown in life. As a result, there was neither the proper gift of prophesying nor of leading that can build up the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-31E-FlFhHZVWfRVsibLPN9Po-xOz3xAzO55Vt-NyImqaLANCOsF5aHepDtdpWJmP">PAUL’S BURDEN</h2><p data-content-id="prVBOIVQEyCQk7WbC65wKBFpZIyHUt92sI6Jhg63N6sMf93hlzv0FeRHAEKBhJS-J"> We know from Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81884" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">3:1</span> that the Corinthian believers had not grown in life, but remained in the stage of infancy. Thus, burdened to point out the need for growth, he says, “I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow; so that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One Who makes to grow, God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81885" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:6-7">vv. 6-7</span>). This clearly indicates that the believers need the planting and the watering in order to grow in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="vFgafReeId0NLp6vSzTQo14EsX_DOCFd1RvaOpYgGNBc9CrkwduxPEplaAWErKNdi"> We have pointed out that even though the Corinthian believers had received the divine life and the Holy Spirit as the seed sown into them, they remained in their infancy and did not grow in life. Actually, they continued to live in their Greek culture, philosophy, and wisdom. This caused confusion in their Christian life, damage to the church life, and ruin to the Body life. Hence, in writing this Epistle Paul was burdened to tell them that they should no longer live their Greek culture, wisdom, and philosophy. </p>
<p data-content-id="WPLFJeiDr66zP26-znBSbuxrk_rGZbWa1hyyz9wagmclIUlGYx9j371es8KAwySLd"> When Paul uses the word wisdom in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81886" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">chapter one</span>, he is specifically referring to the wisdom of Greek culture. I believe that when the Corinthians read this Epistle, they realized that wisdom was equivalent to culture. They remained in their native culture and lived in it. Paul, however, seemed to be saying, “Brothers, God has called you into the fellowship of His Son, not into your culture. The very Christ who is your portion and into whose fellowship you have been called has become wisdom from God to you. Daily He is your righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. No <span class="pg" data-page-id="223" id="223">[223]</span> longer should you live your culture, but you should live Christ. As God’s wisdom, Christ is the deep things of God. What man’s eye has not seen, what man’s ear has not heard, and what man’s heart has never imagined has been revealed to us through the Spirit of God. These things, the depths of God, are related to Christ as God’s mysterious wisdom for our destiny.” </p>

But let each one take heed how he builds upon it. For other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ.” Doctrinally speaking, many Christians understand what it means not to lay any foundation other than Jesus Christ. However, when writing these words, Paul was not speaking in a doctrinal way. He realized that by saying that they were of Paul, Apollos, or Cephas, the Corinthians were actually laying another foundation. Here Paul seems to be saying, “Believers at Corinth, you should not say that you are of anyone or of anything. Christ, the unique foundation, has already been laid. This Christ is the One who is both theirs and ours and also the One into whose fellowship we have been called by God. This Christ is the unique foundation.” </p>
<p data-content-id="uEOnd0iMx5POKDetv2t0ZpmBAFDGOo1C-kpS8aDWbwDZZmpB_EzDqM1j3iDcpaIYK"> It is common for Christians to lay foundations other than Christ as the unique foundation.

This is the right meaning of Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81906" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:10-11">verses 10 and 11</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="fonV3HEy2MU2N2I0YaxDvgIBiUxgNE7RViDm0u4XAqnMbBjw-ecpzlsiH3gTPoymz"> Christians have been divided by the many different foundations. Thousands of foundations have been laid, and more are being laid. Thus, we should be careful not to say that we are of a certain thing or of a certain person. To speak in this way is to lay another foundation; it is also to cause division. Furthermore, in the church in our locality we should not say that we are of anything or anyone or that we are for anything or anyone. We are only of Christ and for Christ. It is possible that even the saints in the local churches are laying different foundations. Regarding this matter, my eyes are very watchful, not over Christianity, but over the Lord’s recovery. Even the saints who love the Lord and His recovery may still say that they are for certain things. This is to lay another foundation. </p>
<p data-content-id="ldCSVKCXVHzwbcJAktI5qY9WW0m-zAHEYxxHCaCwzcGvha9kv82E6htYPVBgcHt9H"> Instead of laying another foundation, we must build upon the foundation already laid. This means that we must build upon the unique Christ. We should understand this not only doctrinally, but also practically and experientially. For example, suppose a brother tells you that, according to his feeling, the church in your locality is not positive. How would you respond to this? The answer you give will reveal whether or not you are building upon Christ as the unique foundation. The best way to respond is not to correct the brother or argue with him, but to pray-read a few verses with him. What matters in pray-reading with such a one is not the particular verses you choose; it is that you have a living spirit filled with the riches of Christ. Then if you pray-read together instead of discussing the situation, that one will be watered and nourished. Nothing waters others and nourishes others more than your living spirit. As long as your spirit is living and is filled with the riches of Christ, others will be watered and nourished, no matter what verses you pray-read. After you have pray-read with this one, there is no need to argue with him about the church or to try to improve him. If he wants to say that the church is not <span class="pg" data-page-id="231" id="231">[231]</span> positive, let him do so. What he needs is not correction or adjustment, but watering and nourishing. Every time this one comes to you, simply water him and nourish him. In a sense, such a one is spiritually sick, or he may be hungry and thirsty. For his sickness, he needs some medicine, and for his hunger and thirst, he needs food and water. Each contact with him is an opportunity to water him and nourish him. Eventually, what is supplied to him will become the medicine that will heal him. After a while, having been nourished and healed, he will no longer say that the church is not positive. He himself will realize that it is nonsense to speak in that way concerning the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="OT5FVjm4b3rEEp9If2G1UsfkTjficISBLmwujITvH9vLo8q-qnrQL8cvvI2WkbUHd"> To fellowship with others with a living spirit full of the riches of Christ is to build upon Christ as the unique foundation. It is also to build with Christ. When you contact others in this way, you build upon Christ and with Christ. As a result, others will be solidly built up into the church as part of the Body. This is to build upon the foundation already laid. </p>
<p data-content-id="45d-EDyyRdejyAtIco9vv--MfBFfH5nEa3CwQ-_J1z9MAZSXg-0MsBpqMhRa6rO3L"> I am very concerned that the saints realize that 1 Corinthians is not a book of doctrine. It is a book which deals with practical problems. It is a mistake to regard this Epistle as one based on doctrinal matters. We may say that Ephesians is written with doctrine as the basis, but this is not true of 1 Corinthians. Whatever Paul says in this book is presented in a practical way in order to solve the problems among the believers. Thus, his word concerning Christ as the unique foundation should be understood not doctrinally, but in a way that is practical and experiential. For example, to say that we are for a certain person or for a certain practice is to lay another foundation. It is a very serious matter to speak in such a way. This is to lay another foundation and to cause division. Furthermore, to minister Christ to others is to build upon the foundation already laid. If we would minister Christ to the saints, we must have spiritual experience. It is not adequate merely to repeat in a doctrinal way messages given in the ministry. We must share with others not a doctrinal Christ, but a Christ we have experienced. <span class="pg" data-page-id="232" id="232">[232]</span> </p>

This means that whenever we give a message or a testimony, or whenever we have fellowship with others, we must be careful not to give others anything except Christ. Furthermore, the Christ we share should not be a doctrinal Christ, but a Christ whom we have experienced. We should minister not merely the knowledge of Christ or the doctrine of Christ, but Christ Himself. In everything we do in the church life, we must take heed not to minister anything other than the Christ we have experienced. </p>

God desires a building, a temple. Take heed that you do not build with your Greek culture, philosophy, and wisdom. Likewise, those with a background in Judaism must be careful not to build with Jewish culture, religion, and concepts. Instead, we all must learn to minister Christ to others.” This is what it means to take heed how we build on the foundation already laid. </p>
<p data-content-id="YAf-ThL_BpKj4Bal8Hh8S_ZBAgDwrplD-euUCFM4sdE5fnGiiRPa9o6wxsU4R57wn"> It is very easy to build on the foundation with something natural or something of our culture, even though we have no intention to do so and are not aware of what we are doing. For example, we may build with something American, Chinese, or German. Furthermore, we may also build with certain elements common to the culture of our particular region. If we minister to others in this way, we are very careless. We are not taking heed how we build. Although I came from China, I am very careful not to build with anything Chinese, but to build only with Christ. It is crucial for us all to learn to build upon Christ as the foundation with the <span class="pg" data-page-id="233" id="233">[233]</span> Christ we have experienced in a practical way. There is a lack of such building among us. I am concerned that many brothers and sisters will simply repeat messages in a doctrinal way. What is urgently needed is the actual, practical, present, and living Christ in our experience. To build with such a Christ is to take heed how we build. </p>

The reason for this is that this chapter was written in an experiential way. Since most readers of 1 Corinthians are short of spiritual experience, they are not able to understand this chapter. In many cases they are not even interested in it and prefer other portions of the Bible, such as Proverbs, which suit their natural concept. </p>
<p data-content-id="b6PkOnBRxPH-JZwYqEGn8CHT8qNMfaW8AclW_7AUwlEPRETelPUlRIL-iaR1qLEZU"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81932" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">First Corinthians 3</span> is deep and profound. In writing this chapter Paul uses many metaphors: milk, solid food, planting, watering, God’s farm, God’s building, foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble, fire, and temple. Without experience we cannot interpret these metaphors properly or understand their significance. Many readers of this chapter pay attention only to two of the metaphors used by Paul: the foundation and the temple. Few know what it means to build with gold, silver, and precious stones or with wood, grass, and stubble. Therefore, for many readers today, this chapter is almost completely closed. </p>
<p data-content-id="qPvGt579Xg2208_F-Y_Px3PmmtBqvIPpmfo-pUvjo8q_UxMIXkBSVMp3PZrkIuHbS"> In reading the Bible many of us have the habit of trying to understand it merely in a doctrinal way or in a theological way. However, when we read any portion of the Bible, we should try to understand it not theologically <span class="pg" data-page-id="240" id="240">[240]</span> but experientially. We should seek to know how this portion of the Word relates to our experience with the Lord. Furthermore, in giving messages we need to present our message in an experiential way, not merely in a doctrinal way. </p>
<p data-content-id="yV3PEIgX1GeafzM-ZlWqiZrLTlMVVP6QmU7e0VLd8-szYYywPm2y0AATrFvXenxHw"> We have pointed out that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81933" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">chapters one and two</span> of 1 Corinthians are deep and profound. These chapters even reveal the depths of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81934" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:10">2:10</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81935" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">Chapter three</span> is also very profound. If Paul had not written this chapter in a metaphorical way, he probably would have needed several more chapters to present what was within him. </p>
<p data-content-id="PxQUR1aSfVg1g5EN0uN6GBmA7oa_DRqoEAI2oKF94p-AdYjLrSH1ujpvA-dj4BNGp"> As we read this chapter we should not only seek to understand the language; we should also look at all the pictures portrayed in it. Paul’s word about God’s farm, a cultivated land, is not only a metaphor, but also a picture. As we consider what it means for the church to be God’s farm, we can visualize plowing, sowing, planting, watering, growing, producing, and harvesting. To consider the matter in this way is to look at the picture conveyed by the metaphors used by Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="-31E-FlFhHZVWfRVsibLPN9Po-xOz3xAzOZ5Vv-NyImqaLANCOsF5aHepDtdpWJmP"> In reading this chapter, we should not take things for granted. Rather, we should ask what it means to lay another foundation. We should also inquire what is the significance of gold, silver, and precious stones, and what is the meaning of the wood, grass, and stubble. For example, when we read Paul’s word about not laying another foundation in the light of the background of the Corinthians, we shall realize that Paul means not to lay Greek philosophy or culture as a foundation. It also implies that we should not make our opinions, preferences, or choices a foundation. A brother may say that he is burdened to go to a certain place. That burden, however, may simply be that brother’s personal taste or preference. In reading this chapter we should be serious and desire to understand what Paul means by all the different metaphors. We must find the proper interpretation of these figures. </p>

All these worthless materials are the product of the believers’ natural man together with what they have collected from their background.

By nature the Greeks are very philosophical. I believe they even philosophized concerning Christ. Thus, wood refers to their nature, their natural makeup. In the same principle, wood denotes what we are according to our natural makeup. For example, the Chinese have an ethical nature. This is their “wood.” We should not build the church with wood. This means that we should not build it with our nature, with our natural makeup. </p>

Wood signifies the nature of the Greeks, whereas grass signifies the natural man of the Greeks. To build the church with grass is to build it with what we are in our natural being. For example, the leader of the Brethren assembly I attended in Chefoo was a very slow and steady person. He always walked slowly, carefully, and deliberately. Once in teaching the Bible he said that God always does things slowly. Because of the influence of this leader, almost everyone in that assembly learned to be slow. When they came into the area of the meeting hall, they walked very slowly. Furthermore, all the prayers in the meetings were <span class="pg" data-page-id="242" id="242">[242]</span> offered in a very slow way. That entire Brethren assembly was according to the natural being of the leader. This is an illustration of what it means to build the church with grass. </p>

In almost any Christian group you can find wood, grass, stubble; that is, you can find the building according to the natural makeup, the natural being, and the characteristics of earthly living. In particular, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81938" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span> wood, grass, and stubble refer to the Greek nature, the Greek being, and the evil of the Greek way of living, especially as these things were expressed among the believers in Corinth. </p>

But let each one take heed how he builds upon it. For other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ.” If we would have the proper and deep understanding of these verses, we need to know the background against which they were written. What was the situation among the Corinthians that caused Paul to say that, apart from Christ, there is no other foundation? The background was that the philosophical believers in Corinth were turning to their Greek culture, philosophy, and wisdom instead of Christ. In practice they were laying other foundations. Furthermore, according to their philosophical mentality, they appreciated various spiritual giants. To appreciate a certain person and prefer him is to make that person a foundation in place of Christ. </p>

However, those who refer to this verse may not understand the background of Paul’s word. Neither do they realize that they themselves may actually be laying another foundation. For some, the foundation is healing or speaking in tongues; for others, it is evangelism or missionary work. As we consider the situation among Christians today, we see that there is almost every kind of foundation imaginable. Almost <span class="pg" data-page-id="248" id="248">[248]</span> anything can become a foundation in place of Christ as the unique foundation. </p>

Among the vast majority of Christians today, there is no governing vision of Christ as the unique foundation. Rather, many ministers and workers “run wild” to lay another foundation. On the one hand, many refer to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81950" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:11">3:11</span> concerning Christ as the foundation; on the other hand, even while speaking of this verse, they are laying another foundation.

Nevertheless, many are still able to take only the milk of doctrine, not the solid food of the deeper, experiential, and practical truths revealed in this book.

<p data-content-id="DeXM5GXdbazrZOx-ax9Rc0jrX8cWBb4GLcXtN4JXJuzK9JlkY0coVF7VTZZGpUzMQ"> It is significant that Paul speaks of the unique foundation in 1 Corinthians, but not in his other Epistles. For example, because this was not part of the background of the Epistle to the Colossians, there is no word concerning it in that book. But the believers at Corinth were laying different foundations. Those philosophical believers were making different persons and practices foundations. This is related to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81952" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:12">1:12</span>: “Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.” This indicates that one laid Apollos as a foundation, whereas others made Cephas or Paul their foundations. Some of the Corinthians laid a foundation of opinion or <span class="pg" data-page-id="249" id="249">[249]</span> wisdom. Thus, among the believers at Corinth, there were many foundations. This background caused Paul to say, “Do not lay any foundation other than Christ. As a wise master builder, I have already laid Christ as the unique foundation. When I came to you, I came with nothing except Christ. I warn you not to lay another foundation, but to build upon the foundation already laid. Furthermore, you must take heed how you build. Do not build with Greek culture, with your opinions or philosophy or with your appreciation or preference for any persons. To build with these materials is to build with wood, grass, and stubble.” To understand 1 Corinthians in this way is to touch the depths of this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="S4UBTaDBLhflHNtSeJetHIxvSeWeK0YxYO1FUh7ZupcAWEz0O3GGyaxAZbn0GYdQO"> The problem in Corinth was that the Greek believers were exalting philosophy and spiritual giants. By doing this they were laying foundations other than Christ. To understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81953" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:11">3:11</span> in this way is to go beyond mere doctrine and grasp the practical significance of Paul’s word. It is also to illustrate the doctrine by the actual situation among the believers. Knowing their situation, Paul seemed to be telling them, “Don’t lay Greek culture or philosophy as a foundation. Neither should you exalt any person and make a person a foundation other than Christ.” If we say that we are for immersion or for speaking in tongues, we are laying a foundation other than Christ. But according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81954" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1:2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81955" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">9</span>, Christ is theirs and ours, and we have been called into the fellowship of Christ. This Christ, God’s unique center and our unique portion, is the unique foundation. </p>

The believers in Corinth were not to build with their Greek culture, philosophy, or makeup. To build in that way is to build with wood, grass, and stubble, not with gold, silver, and precious stones. What does it mean to build with these precious materials? We may say that it is to build with Christ Himself. But we need to go further and see that Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. With the Triune God we have God the <span class="pg" data-page-id="250" id="250">[250]</span> Father as the gold, the redemption of God the Son as the silver, and the transforming work of God the Spirit as precious stones. As we have pointed out, in experience the precious stones are the totality of gold and silver. This means that the Spirit transforms us by means of the divine nature and the cross of Christ. To experience the transforming work of the Spirit is to undergo a metabolic change by the divine life within us. </p>

These chapters are not primarily doctrinal, but experiential. Paul did not compose these chapters with doctrine or theology as the basis. Rather, he composed them according to the actual situation and condition of the church in Corinth. We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the situation among the believers there was that their living was pervaded by Greek culture, philosophy, and wisdom. They were altogether living according to the Greek way of life. Therefore, Paul was burdened to show them that this is not the way to have the Christian life, the church life, or the Body life. In God’s economy the center must be Christ and Christ alone. We have been called into the fellowship of Christ, the Christ who is theirs and ours. This means that Christ is our unique portion, the portion of all those who believe in Him and call upon His name. Since Christ is our only portion, we should not have our own choices or preferences. We should not exalt anyone or anything other than Christ. Christ is the unique portion given to all the saints, and He is everything to us for our living. Christ is wisdom to us from God, our daily righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. This is the central thought concerning Christ in these few chapters. </p>

<p data-content-id="GBDJJALJ0cF4ks8AH19ucJjnWsP4LTnCBC4KGonhfQlZ2XYUYk_NIq7g1JKhMOSI_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81968" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span> of 1 Corinthians there are many precious things and many unusual expressions. This chapter is unique; no chapter in the Bible can replace it. </p>
<p data-content-id="c72SBDvLnZO0HTNpK_Y1vJj4uYnRW9aVwK2G8_uhmUkJUykeLnr0FNqIv6PWDSSzw"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81969" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">verse 1</span> Paul says, “And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ.” Here Paul speaks a very strong word. He refers to the Corinthians not merely as fleshly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81970" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:3">v. 3</span>), but even as fleshy. Fleshy is a stronger expression than fleshly, and refers to aspects of the flesh that are more gross. Fleshy denotes being made of flesh; fleshly denotes being influenced by the nature of the flesh and partaking of the character of the flesh. Paul could not speak to them as to spiritual, but as to those who were fleshy, infants in Christ. He was very strong with the believers at Corinth. If we were to speak such a strong word to the saints today, many would no doubt be offended and refuse to listen any further. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="YAf-ThL_BpKj4Bal8Hh8S_ZBAgDwrplD-deUEWc4sdE5fnGiiRPa9o6wxsU4R57wn">SIX CRUCIAL MATTERS</h2><p data-content-id="EKLQNzB20IJMJNZAsXkVbasdhWNIKYBtUmH0lYADmdSh2KIOAd4oaYB8TBbVW9IBJ"> My burden in this message is to cover several crucial expressions used by Paul in this chapter. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81971" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:2">verse 2</span> he says, “I gave you milk to drink, not solid food.” To give milk to drink or food to eat is to feed others. The King James Version renders the first part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81972" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:2">verse 2</span> this way: “I have fed you with milk.” Feeding refers to the matter of life and differs from teaching, which refers to knowledge. Paul seemed to be teaching the Corinthians; actually he was feeding them. The first crucial expression in this chapter is feeding. To feed others is very pleasant. A mother, for example, is <span class="pg" data-page-id="256" id="256">[256]</span> pleased to feed her children. Likewise, Paul’s desire was to feed the Corinthian believers not only with milk, but also with solid food. </p>
<p data-content-id="DeXM5GXdbazrZOx-ax9Rc0jrX8cWBb4GLcHtFq5XJuzK9JlkY0coVF7VTZZGpUzMQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81973" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:2">verse 2</span>, milk is for drinking and solid food is for eating. Hence, the thought of feeding expressed here automatically implies drinking and eating. Before you came into the church life, you may have been a Christian for years, yet you had never heard a message on drinking. If we would be proper Christians, we must be drinking Christians. Drinking is a basic thought in the book of 1 Corinthians. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81974" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">12:13</span> Paul says that we have all been made to drink of one Spirit. This concept of drinking was not invented by Paul. The Lord Jesus speaks of drinking in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81975" data-verses="John 4:1">John 4</span> and also in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81976" data-verses="John 7:1">John 7</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81977" data-verses="John 4:14">John 4:14</span> He says to the Samaritan woman, “But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81978" data-verses="John 7:37">John 7:37</span>, the Lord Jesus, on the last day of the feast of tabernacles, stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink.” Thus, Christ speaks of drinking, and Paul also speaks of drinking. All Christians should be those who enjoy spiritual drinking. </p>
<p data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp5lflbhQrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen"> Which is more vital to maintaining human life, eating or drinking? The answer is that drinking is even more important than eating. We can go several days without eating, but we cannot go nearly as long without drinking. Furthermore, during the course of a day, we drink more often than we eat. We may eat just three times a day, but we may drink twelve times a day. Medical doctors advise us to drink a glass of water many times a day. Although spiritual drinking is vital to the Christian life, this matter is almost wholly neglected by Christians today. </p>
<p data-content-id="HGln5zZ0kg7BRF2G3k4ch5kayK9fIchfO74VVjfWdxC7j7vo-3Hmf4N_nWwoJM4tK"> Paul’s reference to solid food in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81979" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:2">verse 2</span> surely implies eating. Therefore, along with feeding and drinking, Paul stresses the importance of eating. </p>
<p data-content-id="XfZ84nrEImIc-Nz7b9qjdkNeXbVUzpA1tRstLTvDe1z-Kgbse9Vggac7oUtrY8Ta8"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81980" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:6">verses 6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81981" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:7">7</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81982" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:8">8</span> Paul speaks of planting. In particular, he says of himself, “I planted.” Paul was not only a feeder; he was also a planter. We are told that Paul fed the <span class="pg" data-page-id="257" id="257">[257]</span> saints, giving them something to eat and drink, and that he also planted, but we are not told in this chapter that Paul was a teacher. </p>
<p data-content-id="k_DHJPbquZertxEnBc6g-ljfw4I_Y_AClhVdBOR2ooYdTIhcWKx_8CTD37vjRHlBO"> With the planting we have the watering and the growth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81983" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:6-7">Verses 6 and 7</span> say, “I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow; so that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One Who makes to grow, God.” Thus, in the first seven verses of this chapter, we have six wonderful matters: feeding, drinking, eating, planting, watering, and growing. What a marvelous chapter! Can you find any other chapter in the Word which covers these six matters? I do not believe that there is another chapter in the whole Bible which covers these six things. Regarding this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81984" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span> is unique. In a very brief way, in the span of just seven verses, Paul covers six wonderful matters. In a practical and experiential way, he refers to feeding, drinking, eating, planting, watering, and growing. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="JIZ-QykqNDG1BWmM2KnMOMhZju_iNYeGQhItcsvoJZcGOh57N2xS8o8hJ8R-wu70-">A PLACE FOR FEEDING</h2><p data-content-id="zjs7tyZL5uIfKl2-jisuY3zjK1KLXAhZBQOhfGIaRDYk9Z7bsjPuLM57LGu0lUUp1"> Have you been feeding others in the church life? In order to feed others, we must first be fed ourselves. The church is a place not primarily for teaching, but for feeding. Hence, we should not regard the church as a school, but as a dining hall, even as a restaurant. If others are bothered by the fact that you attend so many church meetings each week and wonder what you do in the meetings, you could say, “The church is a restaurant, and I go there so often because I need to eat.” In the church restaurant, we should feed others and be fed ourselves. </p>
<p data-content-id="anLB0qPKqLGVpnELJCF3jkmpBzp5jxv0suin83xcw1YQmFAHifmPHXLBQ92ZO24yM"> As I give messages in the ministry, I do not have the feeling that I am teaching others or preaching. It is not my intention to be a preacher or teacher. On the contrary, my desire is to be a steward, a waiter. I want to wait on the saints and serve them with Christ. I am not the cook, for the heavenly cook, the Lord Himself, is behind the scene. I am simply a serving one who takes one delicious dish after another and serves it to the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="b6PkOnBRxPH-JZwYqEGn8CHT8qNMfaW8AfFW5oQUwlEPRETelPUlRIL-iaR1qLEZU"> The church meetings should be like a Chinese feast of <span class="pg" data-page-id="258" id="258">[258]</span> many courses. If a friend invites you to a Chinese restaurant for a feast, be prepared to enjoy one course after another. In some feasts there may be as many as twenty different courses including various meats, fish, fowl, vegetables, and soups. The church should be a restaurant where we continually feast on Christ. Christ is the unique diet served in the church restaurant. In this restaurant we enjoy the best food, for every dish is an aspect of Christ Himself. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qPvGt579Xg2208_F-Y_Px3PmmtBqvIPpmcI-gEPjo8q_UxMIXkBSVMp3PZrkIuHbS">DRINKING AND BREATHING</h2><p data-content-id="yV3PEIgX1GeafzM-ZlWqiZrLTlMVVP6QmXbe8F7d8-szYYywPm2y0AATrFvXenxHw"> The way to drink is to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus. By calling on the Lord’s name, we both drink of Him and breathe Him in. Calling on the Lord includes both breathing and drinking. The water we drink is in the air we breathe. The spiritual humidity in the church life is very high, for there is no dryness in the church. Whenever we breathe in the spiritual air by calling, “O Lord Jesus,” we also partake of the water that is in the air. Thus, our breathing eventually becomes our drinking. This means that whenever we breathe, we also drink. </p>
<p data-content-id="8mSjN8Zzt62gkGo0MycXHksy-YBKtJWbb6pv1PSOa49_JwqOmHn6fmadytYtxsWL6"> Much of the time there is no need to call aloud in order to drink. Very quietly we can say, “O Lord Jesus.” Sometimes it is sufficient simply to say, “Lord,” and at other times just to say, “O.” Some may regard this as superstitious. However, from years of experience, I can testify that by calling on the name of the Lord I am refreshed, strengthened, and comforted. If I did not breathe and drink the Lord in this way, I would be very dry and thirsty. Furthermore, my daily life would be quite boring, altogether lacking in refreshment. But simply by saying, “O Lord Jesus,” I am refreshed. </p>
<p data-content-id="0lPdjYmGFHiI5J5XxCYQsri-H6UWaL3fRYomTnpY3_7MOfbRgf2qmCmeLk8UjNCJ1"> Those who are well educated or who are professional people may think that calling on the name of the Lord is not for them, but only for those who are young, inexperienced, or uneducated. But drinking is for everyone. If you do not drink in the Lord by calling on Him, you will experience dryness and boredom. Oh, we all need to drink of the Lord Jesus day by day! </p>

Literally the Greek word rendered farm means cultivated land. The believers who have been regenerated in Christ with God’s life are God’s cultivated land, a farm in God’s new creation to grow Christ. As those who have believed in Christ and received Him, we are no longer like land that is uncultivated or wild. We are not people whom God has not touched. Rather, God has sown something into us, and we have been touched and cultivated by Him. Now we are God’s farm growing Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="h8T7ZUYpMcEVtTeTw4Ei-WaWWau_ZtkWA1Z7VzlWsI31mZB3IXYJad2ffrJvNMmVr"> The concept of sowing, cultivating, and growing is strongly emphasized in the Bible. The Lord Jesus Himself used the figure of a sower. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81988" data-verses="Matthew 13:3">Matthew 13:3</span> He says, “Behold, the sower went out to sow.” We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81989" data-verses="Matthew 13:37">Matthew 13:37</span> that the Lord is the Sower: “He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.” The seed sown by Him is also Himself. It is the Lord in the Word. This seed is God Himself. The Lord Jesus came as a Sower to sow God into us. We are the earth, the ground, the cultivated land, the farm, to grow God. </p>
<p data-content-id="UF3NSi3eZh7Dl_ZC3t8J3SGQLMJgBmML8xw7hqGjfdnUmnLxDxMDWGNZfNU2kahGc"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that the church is a restaurant. Now we are saying that the church is a farm. There is, of course, no contradiction here, for the church has many aspects. As the place for growing produce, the church is a farm. But as a place where the produce is prepared and served as our food, the church is a restaurant. <span class="pg" data-page-id="264" id="264">[264]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Mdwix_GaOy3SQn0ueCAHqoNdP1UMTDSJMzKRe9hvWkxI-OJG9yVXJjndZOAKNjsqN">GROWING AND BUILDING</h2><p data-content-id="VAmSFImgVrwWBDh3eU1j3ZFZPnAW6HkY6J-A3IZXxzEgwGujPfsebgBAiBEiWFZI6"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81990" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">verse 9</span> Paul says that we are both God’s farm and God’s building. There seems to be no logical connection between the farm and the building. What does the farm have to do with the building? No one has ever seen a building constructed of fruit and vegetables grown on a farm. Nevertheless, the church as God’s farm produces the material for His building. </p>
<p data-content-id="h8T7ZUYpMcEVtTeTw4Ei-WaWWau_ZtkWA1Z7ShFWsI31mZB3IXYJad2ffrJvNMmVr"> As Christians, we are growing Christ. Now we must ask ourselves whether or not we have been built. Many of us may hesitate to say that we have been truly built up to become God’s building. If the saints were asked about this, most of them may reply that they have been built to a certain extent. Actually, this is the right answer. With a spiritual building, a building in life, the true building is the growth in life. The extent to which we have been built is the extent to which we have grown. </p>
<p data-content-id="UF3NSi3eZh7Dl_ZC3t8J3SGQLMJgBmML8xw7n42jfdnUmnLxDxMDWGNZfNU2kahGc"> Growing here refers to growing foodstuffs. To grow is also to increase. For example, a certain brother may have weighed only seven pounds at birth, but now he weighs one hundred seventy pounds. This is growth in the second meaning of the word. To be built up in the church is to grow in the sense of increasing with Christ to have a certain stature. The increase of Christ is our stature. To be built into the spiritual building does not first mean to be connected with others. It means to have our natural life reduced and to have Christ increased within us. The more our natural life is reduced and the more Christ increases within us, the easier it will be for us to coordinate with others. In fact, we shall be able to coordinate with anyone. However, some saints have told me that they cannot move from their locality because they have been built with certain saints in the church there. According to their concept, because they have been built together with these ones, it is not possible for them to leave that locality. This is not real building. On the contrary, it is friendship or some kind of social relationship. If you have truly been built into the church, you have been reduced, and Christ has been increased in you. Then, wherever you may be, you can be one <span class="pg" data-page-id="265" id="265">[265]</span> with the saints and coordinate with them. Once you have been built into God’s spiritual building, you can never be taken out of it. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mdwix_GaOy3SQn0ueCAHqoNdP1UMTDSJMzKRXvhvWkxI-OJG9yVXJjndZOAKNjsqN"> As the church, we are God’s farm and God’s building. The farm is for the building. Whatever is produced on the farm and by the farm is for the building. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VAmSFImgVrwWBDh3eU1j3ZFZPnAW6HkY6J-A_aJXxzEgwGujPfsebgBAiBEiWFZI6">THE UNIQUE FOUNDATION</h2><p data-content-id="imdufFGU1VpsTYYg4sAVUG-TWWELatFvWmM3HIW7L7B-Rv1HfZsOuLeAEkuDTcJUK"> A building requires a foundation. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81991" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:10-11">3:10 and 11</span> Paul speaks of the foundation of God’s building: “According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, but another builds upon it. But let each one take heed how he builds upon it. For other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ.” Christ, the unique foundation, has already been laid. This foundation has been established not only for the time of the apostles, but for eternity. However, during the past nineteen centuries, many Christian workers have tried to lay other foundations. Every denomination and group has its own particular foundation. Among Christians today there are thousands of foundations. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1mtnlxhyi5vxsNUaDN97plJIxKXrOz7lTovX_h2zO2SmNPZ4cC3ocFDiy4eTOiBly">LAYING OTHER FOUNDATIONS</h2><p data-content-id="9eaN6Fdd37GIAwbbB4iu5JzKVZeyCcOvauhTi4ngEMpuLpI4URJ1klC1LrBzVosWL"> We need to understand Paul’s word about Christ as the foundation according to the context of the first three chapters of 1 Corinthians. In these chapters Paul seems to be saying, “When you Corinthians declare that you are of Apollos, Cephas, or Paul, you are laying another foundation. Whenever you say that you are of someone or something, you are laying a foundation.” Preferences and choices are actually foundations. For instance, someone may prefer immersion. This is a foundation. Someone else may like to have the Lord’s table with unleavened bread. This also is a foundation. Those who prefer immersion may not accept those who do not practice immersion. The result is division. A division is always caused by laying a foundation other than Christ Himself. We may even lay another foundation by having preferences of local churches. Someone may say that <span class="pg" data-page-id="266" id="266">[266]</span> he does not like the church in his locality and wants to move elsewhere. Even this is to lay a foundation. According to our concept, we have the freedom to choose a local church which matches our preference. We may prefer a particular church because that church suits our taste. To have preferences and choices with respect to churches is to lay another foundation. This is an accurate explanation of Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81992" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:10-11">3:10 and 11</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="jfI-61Rh_EbH_IA1gDUEXyzj4P3_cZ1Wt_AVQ0OJ9jg9A32Kw2FtbNOlkIQAhHCHk"> There is a direct connection between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81993" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:4">verses 4</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81994" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:11">11</span>. This connection becomes apparent when we trace Paul’s thought backward from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81995" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:11">verse 11</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81996" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:4">verse 4</span>. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81997" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:11">verse 11</span>, Christ is the unique foundation. The fact that this verse begins with the word “for” indicates that it is an explanation of the foregoing verse. As we trace this connection backwards, we eventually come to the matter of the planters and the waterers being one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81998" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:8">v. 8</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81999" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:7">verse 7</span> Paul says, “So that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One Who makes to grow, God.” As far as the growth in life is concerned, the ministers of Christ are nothing, and God is everything. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82000" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:5-6">verses 5 and 6</span> we see that Paul, the one who planted, and Apollos, the one who watered, are simply ministers through whom the Corinthians believed. Therefore, the Corinthians should not prefer one or the other. As Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82001" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:4">verse 4</span>, “For whenever one says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not men?” The connection between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82002" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:4">verses 4</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82003" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:11">11</span> is this: Saying that we are of a certain person is to lay another foundation. To belong to someone other than Christ is to lay a foundation besides Christ. Those who said, “I am of Paul,” were laying Paul as a foundation, and those who declared, “I belong to Apollos,” were laying him as a foundation. In principle, the same is true of all those who prefer a certain doctrine, practice, or person. Those who are for immersion lay immersion as a foundation. This separates them from other believers and divides them from those believers. </p>

<p data-content-id="nHflLWyF2nFg6U3Z-4mUTN0kfws3Baz2CRZbmn1TEzR-CESxOjvQhJ575ytY-yo5S"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82013" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span> Paul covers the matters of feeding, drinking, eating, planting, watering, and growing. These are all related to life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82014" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">3:9</span> Paul goes on to refer to the church as God’s farm and God’s building. The farm certainly is a matter of life, and the building is the issue of life. No material building involves anything of life. But the spiritual building mentioned in this chapter has much to do with life. Paul talks about this building not only in 1 Corinthians, but also in Ephesians, Colossians, and Romans. However, the basic points regarding the building are covered in 1 Corinthians. God’s building is altogether a building in life and of life, for it is the building up of the Body of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6nl9vMoAoMK12zKD0K5y_Gx6eSA-Vnhw0UQnFY_a_w2PSkAV7X6WzBuN8UC31SJbX">THE FARM AND THE BUILDING</h2><p data-content-id="RKpt0z8nFNlHi_3vAHu8OcgGgYOj-shs7GeSw9LEU8dkYiKR-u6Z0ZA1R2xXn3ai4"> Apparently, there is no connection between the farm and the building. According to our natural concept, a farm is a matter of life, but a building is a composition of lifeless materials. Thus, there does not seem to be a proper continuation between the expressions God’s farm and God’s building. However, if we realize that the building here is a life building, a building in life, we shall see that there is a direct connection, an excellent continuation, between the farm and the building. Whatever is produced on the farm is not for the farm itself; it is for the building. The produce grown on the farm is for the building. </p>
<p data-content-id="sekrxE0ekH4YzjuJnZ6t8c3cdplKbmWoZ5CtUMMSkFLy5jYO71G6nuPBp_WYYIECE"> Although the produce grown on the farm is for the building, it does not go into the building directly. Rather, we may say that it goes to the church restaurant to be eaten, digested, and assimilated by the saints. Through this process, what is <span class="pg" data-page-id="272" id="272">[272]</span> grown on the farm is consumed by the saints and eventually even becomes them. </p>
<p data-content-id="wIQrvVteeI1oKV87cJZVVv5dOgX231XUsoVU6B3r25XvLEhXjHSjbC3_2HzXXD3x4"> The farm produces not only vegetables, the plant life, but also livestock, the animal life. Both the plant life and the animal life must be eaten by us in the church restaurant. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82015" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:2">3:2</span> Paul says, “I gave you milk to drink.” Milk is a product of both the plant life and the animal life. It is produced by cows, which feed on grass. Milk is a product of the mingling of the animal life with the plant life. This mingling of two lives also produces meat. Without the animal life, we cannot have meat. Likewise, without the plant life, we also cannot have meat, for cattle are dependent on the grass for their food. First they eat the vegetable life and then produce milk and meat for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="qPvGt579Xg2208_F-Y_Px3PmmtBqvIPpneI-gGPjo8q_UxMIXkBSVMp3PZrkIuHbS"> I mention this because both milk and meat are figures of Christ as our life supply. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82016" data-verses="John 6:48">John 6:48</span> the Lord Jesus says, “I am the bread of life.” Bread is made primarily of flour, which comes from the plant life. However, the Lord goes on to speak of the bread as His flesh: “And the bread which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82017" data-verses="John 6:51">John 6:51</span>). This indicates that the composition of this bread is not only of the vegetable life, but also of the animal life; it is flesh-bread. Therefore, it is difficult to say whether Christ as our life supply is of the vegetable life or the animal life. This bread is a product, a mingling, of both lives. </p>
<p data-content-id="yV3PEIgX1GeafzM-ZlWqiZrLTlMVVP6QnVbe8H7d8-szYYywPm2y0AATrFvXenxHw"> The more we eat of Christ as our life supply, the more we shall be transferred into God’s building. First we are the farm to produce something to eat. By eating what is produced on the farm we are brought into the building. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8mSjN8Zzt62gkGo0MycXHksy-YBKtJWba4pv2PyOa49_JwqOmHn6fmadytYtxsWL6">A METABOLIC PROCESS</h2><p data-content-id="0lPdjYmGFHiI5J5XxCYQsri-H6UWaL3fQaomQnJY3_7MOfbRgf2qmCmeLk8UjNCJ1"> In order for the food we eat to become our constitution, there must be the process of metabolism. In the Bible this process is called transformation. Transformation involves a metabolic change. Hence, transformation is altogether a metabolic process. First we eat a meal. After a period of time, the food is digested and assimilated. Eventually, the digested <span class="pg" data-page-id="273" id="273">[273]</span> and assimilated food becomes the fibers of our being. This is metabolism, transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="7UhQ1h6ietnCG3iSYMQGeKol8eEauxoKz2uSFGoQc6bIZTcaCCwQEPzHoI6-oWcib"> In order for an infant of seven pounds to grow into a mature man weighing one hundred seventy pounds, there must be a regular eating and a normal process of metabolism. Gradually, the food taken in by an infant will cause him to grow. Eventually, as a result of a metabolic process over a long period of time, he will become a full-grown man. As a mature man, he is a product, a composition, of all the food he has eaten, digested, and assimilated. This illustrates the process of spiritual metabolism. The produce grown on the farm is eaten and digested by us. Eventually, through the process of metabolism, this food supply becomes us and transforms us into material for the building up of the Body of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PQd6AGHMk6jAgPz44nxU9j8ur2zdeZu3_02jXVAEy7EqNuVxyNwhicQJPFxcqffg"> The church is a farm to grow Christ. Every item of the produce grown on the farm is Christ. The farm produce includes many different aspects of Christ. Christ is the milk, the vegetables, and the meat. The church grows Christ, and all the saints eat Christ. Eventually, through digestion, assimilation, and metabolism, Christ becomes us, and we become Him. Then we are the proper materials for the building. </p>
<p data-content-id="BlFnrZica4yWuQnA7t-H0gDU5fwQYidC1RhvHP3utg7GeZB2ROy6rbjikKwq_wK8F"> Paul’s writing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82018" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span> has a direct connection from item to item. First he refers to feeding, drinking, and eating. Then he goes on to mention planting and watering, after which he tells us that it is God alone who gives the growth. Following this, he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82019" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">verse 9</span> that we are the farm and the building. Therefore, there is a direct connection between all these matters. As we have seen, the farm becomes the building. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xedXR7KyftfYy5rRtYIjXLRf-xguDXvOpccaIX9In7rjMRQgLiFkUjZ1Br4qBKkUQ">BUILDING ON THE UNIQUE FOUNDATION</h2><p data-content-id="rOrhtHgFLbPZdw3O4ue4E_N7etWmKRSVk6tw8C0d5A7IYnxmV72X7JLePRUU6vTBF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82020" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:10-11">verses 10 and 11</span> Paul speaks directly and explicitly concerning Christ as the foundation: “According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, but another builds upon it. But let each one take heed how he builds upon it. For other foundation no one is <span class="pg" data-page-id="274" id="274">[274]</span> able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ.” Here Paul indicates that he had already laid Christ as the unique foundation. In this universe there is just one foundation, and we should not lay another. We must not say that we are of a certain person or a certain thing, that we prefer a certain matter, or that we choose a certain locality for the church life. To speak in this way is to lay another foundation in addition to Christ. Instead of laying another foundation, we need to build upon the foundation already laid. </p>
<p data-content-id="dRbM-RzPLsExpR48s2PLYESmm-66K_L4BLXbJE9LWljslgHPW3EQrzdq0rf_WG4mx"> In today’s Christianity there are many other foundations, but there is virtually no building upon the foundation already laid. The Lord’s recovery must be altogether different. In the recovery we should never lay another foundation; we should simply build on the foundation which was laid more than nineteen hundred years ago. We thank the Lord that, in His mercy, He has recovered this unique foundation. Many years ago, in China, we took a strong stand for Christ as the unique foundation. We had to declare to those in the denominations that we could not have any foundation other than Christ Himself. As a result, many things had to be put aside so that Christ alone would be exalted. Now that the unique foundation has been laid, we should build upon it. </p>
<p data-content-id="QM-bErH4QMuLGtlKhNiUmVseR6-Mo4MAPYWMa8ZbAWzUJ836Exkha9TFHxEakh9zT"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82021" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:10">3:10</span> Paul says, “But let each one take heed how he builds upon it.” When we refer to how we do a certain thing, we usually mean the way, not the material used. When referring to the material, we usually say, “What are you building with?” We do not ask, “How are you building?” But in the Bible these two are the same. How we build upon the foundation is equivalent to what we build with. In other words, according to the Bible, the material used in building is the way we build. According to our natural thought, the material is one thing and the way is another. The material refers to a substance, but the way refers to skill or technique. But in the Bible the substance is the technique; the material is the way. Actually, the Bible pays little attention to skill or technique, but devotes much attention to the material. Paul’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="275" id="275">[275]</span> concern is not by what way or method we build the church. His concern is what material we use in building. </p>

Why does Paul mention only three such materials and not two or four? There are three because these materials refer to the Three of the Trinity, to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="-31E-FlFhHZVWfRVsibLPN9Po-xOz3xAyPJ5T9ONyImqaLANCOsF5aHepDtdpWJmP"> The precious stones are related to the transforming work of the Holy Spirit. Every precious stone is a transformed substance. At one time it used to be some other material, perhaps clay or carbon. Then as a result of intense heat and pressure this material has been transformed into precious stone. Thus, precious stones indicate transformation. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82033" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>, we are transformed by the Lord Spirit. This reveals clearly that transformation is the work of the Spirit. Therefore, the third item of the proper materials mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82034" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:12">3:12</span> refers to the third of the Trinity, the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="prVBOIVQEyCQk7WbC65wKBFpZIyHUt92tJKJrya3N6sMf93hlzv0FeRHAEKBhJS-J"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82035" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> we see that silver was used to redeem the life of God’s people. Silver signifies the redemption accomplished by Christ the Son, the second of the Trinity. Therefore, the silver in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82036" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:12">3:12</span> refers to the redemption of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="vFgafReeId0NLp6vSzTQo14EsX_DOCFd0QfaF7ogGNBc9CrkwduxPEplaAWErKNdi"> Gold, the first of the precious materials mentioned by Paul, refers to the first of the Trinity, God the Father. Gold <span class="pg" data-page-id="280" id="280">[280]</span> signifies neither redemption nor transformation; rather, as a precious element, it signifies something which does not change or become corrupt in nature. Gold always remains the same. Hence, in the Bible it signifies the nature of God the Father. The divine nature, like gold, never changes. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="TgPV7WYzePxLg1dlN-g0NWu5ni7DunVU33j8ppU42YLj5QKtSQNXUKE8xxgPy_6YT">CONSTITUTED OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="nHflLWyF2nFg6U3Z-4mUTN0kfws3Baz2CRpbi1FTEzR-CESxOjvQhJ575ytY-yo5S"> We have seen that gold, silver, and precious stones refer to God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. Now we must go on to see what it means to build with these materials. In order to build with these materials, we ourselves must first be constituted of them. We need to be constituted of the Father’s nature, the Son’s redemption, and the Spirit’s transformation. This means that we must be constituted of the Triune God. When we receive Him, when we take Him into us by drinking Him and eating Him, when we are transfused with Him and by Him, the very Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—comes into us to be our element and substance. This causes a metabolic process to take place within us by which a new element is added and an old element is discharged. Another name for this process is transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="6nl9vMoAoMK12zKD0K5y_Gx6eSA-Vnhw0UgnCK_a_w2PSkAV7X6WzBuN8UC31SJbX"> Transformation does not take place overnight. On the contrary, it is a work which goes on continually day by day. As we call on the Lord Jesus, praise the Father, read and pray-read the Word, pray, sing, worship, attend the meetings of the church, and fellowship with the saints, we take the Triune God into us. The more we receive of Him, the more His element transforms us metabolically and causes us to be constituted of Himself. Then we have gold, silver, and precious stones. </p>
<p data-content-id="RKpt0z8nFNlHi_3vAHu8OcgGgYOj-shs7GuS2vbEU8dkYiKR-u6Z0ZA1R2xXn3ai4"> To have gold is to have the Father’s incorruptible nature. To be redeemed is to be terminated, replaced, and brought back to God through Christ. Even though we are saved, in many things we are still far away from the Triune God. When Christ becomes our redemption, He brings us back to God, terminates our natural life, and replaces us with Himself. This is to experience silver. Following this, the third of <span class="pg" data-page-id="281" id="281">[281]</span> the Triune God, the Spirit, works both within us and in our circumstances to transform us into precious stones. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sekrxE0ekH4YzjuJnZ6t8c3cdplKbmWoZ5ytdfsSkFLy5jYO71G6nuPBp_WYYIECE">THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION</h2><p data-content-id="wIQrvVteeI1oKV87cJZVVv5dOgX231XUsolUySHr25XvLEhXjHSjbC3_2HzXXD3x4"> Transformation involves the Spirit’s working both inwardly and outwardly. The Spirit works outwardly in our circumstances for the sake of His inward working. For example, the Spirit may use our children to help transform us. We may expect that our children will be submissive and obedient. But a certain child may be stubborn or even rebellious. Such a child can cause us to be pressed for the sake of our transformation. As an elderly person with many children and grandchildren, I can testify that the Spirit often uses our children to press us and “burn us” as part of His work of transformation. When I first began to experience this in my family life, I was troubled and could not explain what was going on. Gradually I came to know that I needed the heat and pressure caused by my children. I also came to see that I need other pressures as well. It takes a great deal of intensified heat and pressure for clay to become precious stones. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82037" data-verses="Romans 8:28">Romans 8:28</span>, God causes all things to work together for good on our behalf. We need all things to work for us. Therefore, we should not be surprised when even our children are used to press us and burn us so that we may become precious stones. </p>
<p data-content-id="LCOBHh-_8rtpkoOSBhuJ3SLJouiGtADmRc7cGn7K7WCcffclCOEo5EYkos9Kc9G0W"> Many Christians are under the influence of the teaching that if we believe in the Lord Jesus and behave ourselves properly for the glory of God, we shall be blessed and prospered in every way. According to this teaching, we shall be successful and prosperous. Furthermore, supposedly our children will become successful in their chosen professions. If this teaching is accurate, then Paul must be the most pitiful believer who ever lived. Listen to what he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82038" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:11-13">4:11-13</span>: “Until the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked and beaten and wander without a home; and we labor, working with our own hands; being reviled we bless, being persecuted we bear it, being defamed we appeal; we have become as the offscouring of the world, as the scum of all <span class="pg" data-page-id="282" id="282">[282]</span> things until now.” Is this the description of one who is successful and prosperous? Paul’s situation was very different from that promised by the teaching that those who believe in the Lord and live properly will be blessed materially. However, Paul was in fact the most blessed of Christians, for he was truly constituted of the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="mA_96h-ZPzHjy0DOYoWw3UVdng1dAcNQKYq0jfM6FnoHymfKQciucRWHW48k6Jjdb"> We in the Lord’s recovery should not be frightened by the process of transformation. We should not desire to turn from the recovery and seek an easier way, to go to a religious gathering where we can be comforted psychologically. We praise the Lord that we are receiving the Lord’s nourishment and are also undergoing the process of transformation. We are receiving more of the divine gold into our being. I can strongly testify that I do not regret taking the way of the Lord’s recovery. Yes, I have lost a lot, but I have gained much more. If there is no loss, there can be no gain. What I have lost has been material things, but I have gained the nature of God my Father. I have gained the gold of the divine nature, something that never changes or decays. Hallelujah for the divine nature that has been added into us! We also praise the Lord for the wonderful redemption we are experiencing daily to be terminated, brought back to God, and replaced by Christ Himself. We are also thankful for the heat and pressure which are transforming us from clay into precious stones. </p>

Building is a matter of growth and transformation. The more we grow, the more we are rescued from our natural being. Then wherever we may be, we can easily be one with the saints. This is building. </p>
<p data-content-id="F_0pIc17fjqQrLFCajrHceBnEm3EkINB6oIu-NsW-twLqCp0pOLPqCxrSvbNiuAOt"> If we have been built up in a genuine way, there will be no opinions, disputations, strifes, comparisons, preferences, or choices. We shall simply be for the Lord’s Body and desire to be part of the Body. No matter where we may go, we shall be one with every saint. This is what it means to be built with gold, silver, and precious stones. <span class="pg" data-page-id="283" id="283">[283]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="CFF3xQmaFvwJ5j4xk2Wr_M9AHisFFvvZHwIjiuFhhQwaE4qISeDhS6DHqSHn3a8XL"> The majority of today’s Christians are divided. It is difficult even to find two who have been built together in a proper way. The reason for the division and the lack of building is that the believers remain in their natural life, in their natural being, and in their worldly aspirations. Many still have their own preferences, desires, and choices. As a result, it is impossible for them to be truly one. Therefore there cannot be the practical Body life among them. </p>

In the first two chapters of this book, Paul deals with the wisdom of the Corinthians. Because of their philosophical wisdom, they were divisive, and they exalted spiritual giants. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82053" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:18">3:18</span> Paul refers to those who think themselves to be wise, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82054" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:19">verse 19</span> he says that the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. In the sight of God, Greek wisdom is foolishness. The Lord grasps the wise in their craftiness, and He knows that the reasonings of the wise are vain (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82055" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:20">v. 20</span>). </p>

DESTROYING THE TEMPLE OF GOD<br/>BY BUILDING THE CHURCH WITH NATURAL THINGS<br/>AND BEING PUNISHED BY GOD</h2><p data-content-id="k_DHJPbquZertxEnBc6g-ljfw4I_Y_ACkj1dHcB2ooYdTIhcWKx_8CTD37vjRHlBO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82056" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:17">First Corinthians 3:17</span> says, “If anyone destroys the temple of God, God shall destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, which you are.” To destroy the temple of God is to ruin, corrupt, defile, or mar it. To destroy the temple of God means to build with the worthless materials of wood, grass, and stubble, as described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82057" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:12">verse 12</span>. This refers to some Jewish believers who attempted to build the church with elements of Judaism, and to some Greek believers who endeavored to bring philosophical elements into the building. All this tended to corrupt, ruin, defile, and mar the temple of God, that is, to destroy it. Using any doctrine which differs from the fundamental teachings of the apostles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82058" data-verses="Acts 2:42">Acts 2:42</span>), or any ways and efforts that contradict God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="288" id="288">[288]</span> nature, Christ’s redemptive work, and the Spirit’s transforming work is to corrupt, ruin, defile, mar, and destroy the church of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="JIZ-QykqNDG1BWmM2KnMOMhZju_iNYeGRjotV_PoJZcGOh57N2xS8o8hJ8R-wu70-"> The word destroy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82059" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:17">verse 17</span> at least implies the punishment unveiled in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82060" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:15">verse 15</span>. All those who have corrupted, ruined, defiled, and marred the church of God by their heretical doctrines, divisive teachings, worldly ways, and natural efforts in building will suffer God’s punishment. </p>
<p data-content-id="zjs7tyZL5uIfKl2-jisuY3zjK1KLXAhZASuhXV4aRDYk9Z7bsjPuLM57LGu0lUUp1"> In this verse Paul points out that the temple of God is holy. Since the temple of God, the church, is holy, the materials, the ways, and the efforts by which we build it must also be holy and correspond to God’s nature, Christ’s redemption, and the Spirit’s transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="rOrhtHgFLbPZdw3O4ue4E_N7etWmKRSVk6Nw8A0d5A7IYnxmV72X7JLePRUU6vTBF"> We have seen that to build the church with natural things, with wood, grass, and stubble, is to build with our natural makeup, our being, and such evil doings as jealousy, strife, envy, and hatred. With wood, grass, and stubble, there is nothing precious. The interpretation of these figures is not the important matter here; the crucial matter is that we realize that our nature, our being, and our negative doings have no part in the building up of the church. As members of the church, we must participate in the building up of the church. However, we must take heed not to allow the wood, the grass, and stubble—our nature, our being, and our evil doings—to be brought into the church. It is dreadful to inject these things into the church life. We need to have a deep realization of this. We need to see how abominable it is and condemn it. </p>
<p data-content-id="dRbM-RzPLsExpR48s2PLYESmm-66K_L4BL3bJG9LWljslgHPW3EQrzdq0rf_WG4mx"> During the last nineteen hundred years, there has been hardly any real building up of the church. Today the Bible is freely available, and the gospel has been preached in every country. But where is the genuine building up of the church? We must admit that even among us in the Lord’s recovery there is not much building. The reason for this lack is that too much of our nature, being, and doings have been brought into the church life. These elements are germs which damage the church life. However, we may not be enlightened regarding the seriousness of this matter. <span class="pg" data-page-id="289" id="289">[289]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="QM-bErH4QMuLGtlKhNiUmVseR6-Mo4MAPY2MZ85bAWzUJ836Exkha9TFHxEakh9zT"> Certain saints are strong in their character or peculiar in their way of thinking. Others, however, may regard themselves as common, general, and not strong in any particular way. But according to my experience and observation, such persons are the most natural ones. They may not criticize others and they may adapt to every situation. Nevertheless, they are extremely difficult to deal with. Some of the saints who are unusually nice are like rubber, which cannot be broken. Nothing seems to touch them. No matter how they are treated, they never lose their temper. But automatically these people bring their nature and being into the church life. They regard their nature as good, and others also may appreciate it. Thus, it is unconsciously injected into the church life. But because all this is natural, it cannot be the proper material for the building up of the church. Of course, those who are rough and tough by nature are also not the right material for God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="K9Fhzhq9ETFPCPzdkFWRrkfkDyu0qmgIoxS5sjP0zVrET7fYv2qxzXlZDmd0Kk9SX"> It is very difficult to find any use for stubble, but certain kinds of wood may be useful and also have a good appearance. Many saints in the Lord’s recovery are like this kind of wood. But not even the wood of a humanity that is naturally good is useful for the building up of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="ldCSVKCXVHzwbcJAktI5qY9WW0m-zAHEZwhHCbCwzcGvha9kv82E6htYPVBgcHt9H"> To build the church with natural things is to destroy the temple of God. Many years ago I thought that to destroy the temple of God was to persecute the church. I did not realize that, according to the context, to destroy the church is to build with natural things. For example, would it not mar the New Jerusalem to bring in grass or stubble? Likewise, to inject our natural makeup, our being, or our doings into the church damages the church. Perhaps you have never realized that when you bring your good nature, your good being, and even your good natural deeds into the church life, you ruin and corrupt the church. Of course, if there is jealousy or strife among us, that will also mar and defile the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="OT5FVjm4b3rEEp9If2G1UsfkTjficISBKngujJTvH9vLo8q-qnrQL8cvvI2WkbUHd"> Those who destroy the church by building with natural things will be punished by God. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82061" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:17">verse 17</span>, those who destroy God’s temple will be destroyed by Him. One aspect of God’s punishment is darkness. It certainly is a <span class="pg" data-page-id="290" id="290">[290]</span> serious punishment not to have light and to remain in darkness. If you build the church with natural things, you will be in darkness. God punished Pharaoh with darkness, and He will also use darkness to punish the kingdom of Antichrist (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82062" data-verses="Exodus 10:21-23">Exo. 10:21-23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82063" data-verses="Revelation 16:10">Rev. 16:10</span>). This indicates that darkness is a serious punishment. All those who endeavor to bring their nature, being, and doings into the church will be left in darkness. </p>
<p data-content-id="45d-EDyyRdejyAtIco9vv--MfBFfH5nEb2SwQ__J1z9MAZSXg-0MsBpqMhRa6rO3L"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82064" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:13-15">verses 13 through 15</span>, our building work will be tested by fire. If our work remains, we shall receive a reward. But if our work is consumed, we shall suffer loss. I cannot say definitely what this judging fire is. However, in both the Old Testament and the New, fire comes from God as a judgment. For example, Aaron’s sons, Nadab and Abihu, were judged by fire. In the book of Malachi we are told that the Lord will judge people by fire. In the same principle, fire from God will judge our work. Work that is of gold, silver, and precious stones will pass the test of fire. In fact, the more intense the fire is, the more refined these materials become. However, everything of wood, grass, and stubble will be consumed by fire. Whatever is done according to our nature, being, and natural doings will be burned by fire. </p>
<p data-content-id="oHvwn1F9kPbTytIPVynf_MGPeusawFjhSrZMyP7fRRrtjdCyM9IgKVBeI7sBRsMLT"> The Lord’s punishment has at least two aspects: darkness and burning. We ourselves may be in darkness, and our work may be burned to ashes. Often I have been in fear and trembling before the Lord, wondering if my work will remain. Many times I have asked myself if my work will pass the test of the Lord’s judging fire. We all should inquire whether our work brings us into the light or keeps us in darkness. Some of those who labored on the mission field can testify that the more they worked, the more they remained in darkness. This is a sign that their work was according to their nature, being, and human doings. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3E2ZRbJydxokD8WKMAIbtFfHb0jzb68DjK7ropmbxR9wRW14_fX2fsKcexAdJrzWM">II. DESTROYING THE TEMPLE OF GOD, THE CHURCH,<br/>BY BOASTING IN SPIRITUAL GIANTS</h2><p data-content-id="GBDJJALJ0cF4ks8AH19ucJjnWsP4LTnCAAYKC4XhfQlZ2XYUYk_NIq7g1JKhMOSI_"> To boast in spiritual giants is also to destroy the temple of God, the church.

Thus, we must be careful not to have preferences in elders, co-workers, or in brothers and sisters. Along with learning not to bring our nature, being, and doings into the church, we must also learn not to have preferences for any persons. If we exalt a certain person, we shall mar, defile, destroy, the temple of God, and we shall suffer God’s punishment. </p>

<p data-content-id="7UhQ1h6ietnCG3iSYMQGeKol8eEauxoKz3-SCVIQc6bIZTcaCCwQEPzHoI6-oWcib"> The subject of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82082" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:1">1 Corinthians 4</span> is stewards of the mysteries of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82083" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:1-21">4:1-21</span>). The focus of this chapter is neither Christ nor the church; it is the stewards of God’s mysteries. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82084" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:1">4:1</span> Paul says, “In this way let a man account of us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.” The Greek word rendered stewards in this verse is of the same root as the word economy or dispensation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82085" data-verses="1Timothy 1:4">1 Timothy 1:4</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82086" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span>. It means a dispensing steward, a household administrator, one who dispenses the household supply to its members. The apostles were appointed by the Lord to be such stewards, dispensing God’s mysteries, which are Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82087" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">Col. 2:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82088" data-verses="Ephesians 3:4">Eph. 3:4</span>), to the believers. The dispensing service, the stewardship, is the ministry of the apostles. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PQd6AGHMk6jAgPz44nxU9j8ur2zdeZu3-k2lElAEy7EqNuVxyNwhicQJPFxcqffg"> In God’s economy revealed in the New Testament there are mainly two mysteries. The first mystery, revealed in the book of Colossians, is Christ as the mystery of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82089" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">Colossians 2:2</span> Paul speaks of the “full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.” Christ is God’s mystery. In Himself God is a mystery. He is real, living, and almighty; however, He is invisible. Because no one has ever seen God, He is a mystery. This mysterious God is embodied in Christ. Hence, Christ is the mystery of God. Christ is not only God, but He is God embodied, God defined, God explained, and God expressed. Therefore, Christ is God made visible. The Lord Jesus said, “He who has seen Me has seen the Father” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82090" data-verses="John 14:9">John 14:9</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="298" id="298">[298]</span>). The first mystery in God’s economy is Christ, God expressed, as the mystery of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="BlFnrZica4yWuQnA7t-H0gDU5fwQYidC1QxvOc3utg7GeZB2ROy6rbjikKwq_wK8F"> The second mystery, revealed in the book of Ephesians and explained in it, especially in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82091" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">chapter three</span>, is the mystery of Christ. Christ also is a mystery. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82092" data-verses="Ephesians 3:4">Ephesians 3:4</span> Paul uses the expression “the mystery of Christ.” Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82093" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">Colossians 1:27</span> says, “To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.” As believers, we have Christ dwelling in us. But this Christ whom we have is a mystery. Although Christ lives in us, worldly people do not realize that He is in us. To them, this is a mystery. But although Christ is mysterious, the church is the manifestation of Christ. As the Body of Christ, the church is the expression of Christ. When we see the church, we see Christ. When we come into the church, we come into Christ. When we contact the church, we contact Christ. The church is truly the mystery of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="xedXR7KyftfYy5rRtYIjXLRf-xguDXvOpdMaAEtIn7rjMRQgLiFkUjZ1Br4qBKkUQ"> When in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82094" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:1">4:1</span> Paul refers to the mysteries of God, he means Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ. Paul and the other apostles were stewards of these mysteries. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zjyvva9_mwbWU7v14CMragfkXMl76M85AJoYr3C2npxvRcj28K_niY4FY2FqTLVIx"> We have pointed out that the Greek word for stewards in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82095" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:1">4:1</span> is of the same root as the word economy or dispensation used elsewhere. This word, <em>oikonomia,</em> denotes a household administration or management. In the New Testament a steward is one who serves and takes care of the dispensing of God to His family. God has a very large family, and His desire is to dispense Himself into all the members of His family. </p>
<p data-content-id="A3Oa3UPcjrJzR4wlouzXCJftgWRSWHHN8IWG0osifE_yD30wsSCVCR1Rhevz1xRO7"> The place of a steward in God’s family may be illustrated by the function of a steward in a wealthy family in ancient times. A steward in such a family was responsible to care for the dispensing of the means of life—food, clothing, and other necessities—to the members of the family. Wealthy families often had an abundant supply of these necessities in storage. The responsibility of a steward was to dispense this supply to the members of the family. Using this as a metaphor, <span class="pg" data-page-id="299" id="299">[299]</span> Paul refers to himself as a steward in God’s family. God is exceedingly rich; He has a vast storehouse of goods which He intends to dispense into His children. But this dispensation requires a steward. Thus, a steward is a dispenser, one who dispenses the divine life supply to God’s children. </p>
<p data-content-id="F_0pIc17fjqQrLFCajrHceBnEm3EkINB6pou9NMW-twLqCp0pOLPqCxrSvbNiuAOt"> As such a dispenser, Paul dispensed Christ into all the believers. Receiving such a dispensation through Paul, the believers could then grow with the supply they had received. By this we see that Paul’s ministry was a dispensing ministry, a ministry of dispensing the unsearchable riches of Christ into our being so that we may grow and become the church. Paul dispensed Christ’s riches not only into the saints individually, but also into the Body corporately. </p>
<p data-content-id="CFF3xQmaFvwJ5j4xk2Wr_M9AHisFFvvZHxojhulhhQwaE4qISeDhS6DHqSHn3a8XL"> Paul’s service of dispensing is called the stewardship. In other words, this stewardship is the ministry. The ministry is a stewardship, a service, that dispenses the riches of Christ into the saints, the members of the Body, and into the church, the Body as a whole. May we all be impressed with the two crucial matters of the mysteries of God and the dispensing steward. </p>
<p data-content-id="PxQUR1aSfVg1g5EN0uN6GBmA7oa_DRqoFA42oLF94p-AdYjLrSH1ujpvA-dj4BNGp"> If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82096" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:1">1 Corinthians 4</span> carefully, we shall see that this chapter on the stewards of the mysteries of God emphasizes four main points: faithful servants of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82097" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:1-5">vv. 1-5</span>), a spectacle both to angels and to men (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82098" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:6-9">vv. 6-9</span>), the offscouring of the world and the scum of all things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82099" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:10-13">vv. 10-13</span>), and the begetting father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82100" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:14-21">vv. 14-21</span>). We shall cover the first two points in this message and the last two points in the following message. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-31E-FlFhHZVWfRVsibLPN9Po-xOz3xAyOp5Vu-NyImqaLANCOsF5aHepDtdpWJmP">I.

In these verses Paul charges us not to boast in men, for all things are ours, we are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s. </p>
<p data-content-id="vFgafReeId0NLp6vSzTQo14EsX_DOCFd0R_aNo4gGNBc9CrkwduxPEplaAWErKNdi"> In this way, Paul says, he was to be accounted as a servant of Christ. The Greek word rendered “account” here also means reckon, measure, or classify. Paul is saying that he <span class="pg" data-page-id="300" id="300">[300]</span> was to be evaluated, or estimated, in this way as a servant of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="WPLFJeiDr66zP26-znBSbuxrk_rGZbWa0hiyw_QagmclIUlGYx9j371es8KAwySLd"> The word servant in this verse means an attendant or appointed servant, an official servant appointed specifically for a certain purpose (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82103" data-verses="Acts 26:16">Acts 26:16</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="2x5QcsCAgui9NXQYMVnCg51gf1NTLk96FwgmcxHan8nZifIVz9C609J7eMcjMZTbI"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82104" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:2">verse 2</span> Paul goes on to say, “Here, furthermore, it is sought in stewards that one be found faithful.” The word “here” means in the stewardship, in the dispensing ministry. In this dispensing ministry it is most important that stewards be found faithful. </p>
<p data-content-id="uEOnd0iMx5POKDetv2t0ZpmBAFDGOo1C_kJS2IjWbwDZZmpB_EzDqM1j3iDcpaIYK"> Here Paul seems to be talking about himself. Today many so-called spiritual people think that it is always wrong for Christians to talk about themselves. When I was with the Brethren, we were taught never to refer to ourselves in a positive way. But here Paul seems to indicate that he was faithful as a steward. </p>
<p data-content-id="fonV3HEy2MU2N2I0YaxDvgIBiUxgNE7RUijm_8IXAqnMbBjw-ecpzlsiH3gTPoymz"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82105" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:3">verse 3</span> Paul continues, “But to me it is a very small thing that I should be examined by you or by man’s day; nor do I even examine myself.” The word examined means examined for judgment or in judgment. It also means to be criticized. Paul is saying that he regarded it as a small thing to be criticized by the saints or by man’s day. Man’s day is the present age in which man judges. This is in contrast to the Lord’s day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82106" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:13">3:13</span>), which will be the coming age, the kingdom age, in which the Lord will judge. </p>
<p data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp4mPlYhwrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen"> In this verse Paul also tells us that he did not even examine himself. He regarded it as a very small matter to be examined by the Corinthians or by man’s day, and he would not examine himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="HGln5zZ0kg7BRF2G3k4ch5kayK9fIchfP4oVWj_WdxC7j7vo-3Hmf4N_nWwoJM4tK"> In this verse there are two basic matters we all need to learn. First, we should not care about being criticized or judged by others. Most Christians find it unbearable to be judged or criticized. Certain sisters, if they learn that others have criticized them, may not be able to sleep well for a long period of time. This is true of brothers also. Suppose a certain brother who is an elder learns that someone has spoken critically of him. He may not be able to rest well that night, for he may say to himself, “I am one of the elders in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="301" id="301">[301]</span> church, but certain ones are criticizing me.” If we are bothered by criticism, it indicates that it is a great thing, not a small thing, for us to be examined by others. We cannot yet say with Paul, “To me it is a very small thing that I should be examined by you.” </p>

<p data-content-id="45d-EDyyRdejyAtIco9vv--MfBFfH5nEb3ywXs_J1z9MAZSXg-0MsBpqMhRa6rO3L"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82121" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:9">4:9</span> Paul says, “For, I think, God has set forth us the apostles last of all, as doomed to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.” It is significant that here Paul says ”I think.” This means that Paul was not fully assured. This is not a matter of humility; it is a matter of speaking according to the principle of incarnation. Paul does not say here, “Thus saith the Lord.” Neither does he declare, “Brothers and sisters, don’t you know that I am speaking in the spirit?” In today’s Pentecostalism there is a practice of declaring, “Thus saith the Lord.” However, such a practice is not according to the New Testament principle. </p>
<p data-content-id="oHvwn1F9kPbTytIPVynf_MGPeusawFjhSq5M0crfRRrtjdCyM9IgKVBeI7sBRsMLT"> In this chapter Paul speaks soberly, yet in a very intimate way. He was rebuking, instructing, correcting, adjusting, and disciplining the believers, but he was doing all this in a very intimate manner. Then at a certain point he inserted the words “I think.” I believe that Paul knew that his speaking was truly of God. Nevertheless, he said “I think” because he knew that the New Testament principle is the principle of incarnation. According to this principle, God speaks in our speaking. God and man become one. When man is mingled with God in doing a certain thing, that is simultaneously both God’s doing and man’s doing. Because the words “I think” illustrate this principle, I regard their insertion in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82122" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:9">verse 9</span> as very precious. How meaningful it is that God may speak in our speaking! The clause “I think” indicates that Paul was speaking. Nevertheless, in keeping with the <span class="pg" data-page-id="308" id="308">[308]</span> principle of incarnation, Paul’s speaking was God’s speaking. Because Paul and God were one, when Paul spoke, God spoke also. This is the significance of the words “I think” used in this verse. </p>
<p data-content-id="3E2ZRbJydxokD8WKMAIbtFfHb0jzb68DjLbrh5GbxR9wRW14_fX2fsKcexAdJrzWM"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82123" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:9">verse 9</span> Paul uses the phrase “last of all.” This expression, commonly understood at the time, refers to the last part of the performance in the amphitheater. According to ancient custom, when criminals fought with wild beasts in the amphitheater for the entertainment of the populace, the criminals were exhibited last of all. The last act, the last show, was that of condemned criminals fighting with wild beasts for the entertainment of the people. The phrase “last of all” refers to this. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82124" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:9">verse 9</span> Paul uses this expression metaphorically to convey the thought that God has set forth the apostles last of all, as if they were the lowest criminals condemned to death, to be entertainment for the people. </p>
<p data-content-id="GBDJJALJ0cF4ks8AH19ucJjnWsP4LTnCAB4KKonhfQlZ2XYUYk_NIq7g1JKhMOSI_"> In Greek the word rendered “spectacle” is the word for theater. It refers to a show, a display, made in a theatrical way as entertainment. Thus, Paul was saying to the Corinthians, “You are already filled. You have become rich, and you have reigned without us. I would that you really did reign as kings so that we could reign with you. For, I think, God has set forth us the apostles last, as doomed to death.” </p>
<p data-content-id="3E2ZRbJydxokD8WKMAIbtFfHb0jzb68DjLbrormbxR9wRW14_fX2fsKcexAdJrzWM"> When Paul says, “I would that you really did reign,” he indicates that the Corinthian believers were not actually reigning as kings. On the contrary, they were in a dream. The fact that they were not yet kings is proved by Paul’s word about the apostles being set forth last of all. Paul seems to be saying, “God has not made us kings in this age. Rather, He has set us forth as if we were criminals doomed to death, to fight with beasts.” This metaphor presents a vivid picture of the apostles’ situation. Far from reigning as kings, they were as criminals doomed to fight with wild beasts for people’s entertainment. Today this is also our destiny in the sight of man. However, in the sight of God, our destiny is to enjoy Christ. We who enjoy Christ have become as criminals in the sight of man for their enjoyment. But in <span class="pg" data-page-id="309" id="309">[309]</span> the sight of God Christ is our destiny for our enjoyment. Many have ridiculed us and mocked us. But while they mock us for their entertainment, we are enjoying Christ. This shows that we have two destinies. Our destiny in the sight of God is to have Christ for our enjoyment. Our destiny in the sight of man is to be regarded as criminals condemned to death for others’ entertainment. If we are faithful to the Lord, as Paul was, this will be our destiny before men. We shall be set forth last of all, and we shall be made a spectacle both to angels and to men. </p>

<p data-content-id="YAf-ThL_BpKj4Bal8Hh8S_ZBAgDwrplD_eeUCEM4sdE5fnGiiRPa9o6wxsU4R57wn"> After pointing out that the apostles have become a spectacle to the world, Paul goes on to say in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82126" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:10">verse 10</span>, “We are fools because of Christ, but you are prudent in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are glorious, but we are dishonored.” The apostles were willing to be foolish by forsaking their human wisdom for the sake of Christ. But the fleshly Corinthian believers remained prudent in their natural wisdom, while claiming they were in Christ. Paul did not say that they were philosophers because of Christ; he declares that they were fools because of Christ. In a sense, every believer in Christ must become a fool. Many who were wise in this world have become fools of Christ. But although the apostles had become fools because of Christ, the Corinthians sought to remain prudent. </p>
<p data-content-id="EKLQNzB20IJMJNZAsXkVbasdhWNIKYBtVlH0sLgDmdSh2KIOAd4oaYB8TBbVW9IBJ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82127" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:10">verse 10</span> Paul also says, “We are weak, but you are strong.” The apostles while ministering Christ appeared to be weak, for they used no strength or power of their natural being (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82128" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:3">2:3</span>). But the fleshly Corinthian believers were strong, claiming prominence among the believers by exercising their natural ability. <span class="pg" data-page-id="310" id="310">[310]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="DeXM5GXdbazrZOx-ax9Rc0jrX8cWBb4GKfHtN5JXJuzK9JlkY0coVF7VTZZGpUzMQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82129" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:10">verse 10</span> Paul also tells the Corinthians, “You are glorious, but we are dishonored.” The Corinthian believers were glorious, or honorable, in a display of splendor. But the apostles were dishonored and despised by the glory-seeking Corinthians. By this we can see that the Corinthians were altogether wrong in their way of running the Christian course. </p>
<p data-content-id="S4UBTaDBLhflHNtSeJetHIxvSeWeK0YxZNlFUg7ZupcAWEz0O3GGyaxAZbn0GYdQO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82130" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:11-13">verses 11 through 13</span> Paul continues, “Until the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked and beaten and wander without a home; and we labor, working with our own hands; being reviled we bless, being persecuted we bear it, being defamed we appeal.” Defamed means insulted, spoken of injuriously. To appeal here is to entreat with exhortation, consolation, and encouragement in order to appease. </p>
<p data-content-id="gtgtI35Vr92rZOQoDGIVGs8NRXsfme5u2Q92yUglaZ2BEOI4Y3brU9LirmsGa_3J7"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82131" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:13">verse 13</span> Paul says, “We have become as the offscouring of the world, as the scum of all things until now.” Offscouring and scum are synonyms. Offscouring denotes that which is thrown away in cleansing; hence, refuse, filth. Scum denotes that which is wiped off; hence, rubbish, refuse. Both synonyms are metaphorically used, especially of condemned criminals of the lowest class, who were cast into the sea or to the wild beasts in the amphitheater. Here Paul likens himself to the lowest criminals, to offscouring, scum, rubbish, refuse. Compared to many of my friends from the past, I also am scum and offscouring. They have become very successful and have acquired much wealth. They regard me as a fool and wonder what I have been doing with my life. Occasionally I meet friends from many years ago. When they ask me what I have been doing, I am not sure how to answer. They have become extremely successful, but we have become the offscouring of the world and the scum of all things. We are qualified only to be cast aside as waste. This was Paul’s estimation of himself with respect to both the Jews and the Gentiles. </p>

<p data-content-id="gtgtI35Vr92rZOQoDGIVGs8NRXsfme5u2QN22HwlaZ2BEOI4Y3brU9LirmsGa_3J7"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82152" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:1-13">5:1-13</span> Paul turns to the matter of dealing with an evil brother. The first problem, dealt with in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82153" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">chapters one through four</span>, is the matter of division, which is mainly related to the natural life of the soul. The second problem, dealt with in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82154" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:1">chapter five</span>, the second section of the book, is the sin of fornication, which is related to the lust of the flesh. Morally speaking, this problem, involving incest between a brother and his stepmother, is more gross than the former. The former pertains to the strife that comes from pride. The latter is a gross sin that comes from lust. </p>
<p data-content-id="eUZwTHuTDFPfNYOCu1n50UUorE6pAtRKK-fM-s6Y_zFf532UtF6kNi_wohlwMw9hh"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82155" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:1">Chapter five</span> of 1 Corinthians has certain special characteristics. First, this chapter shows that even a genuine believer can commit a gross sin. Many who read the New Testament may think that, because of the grace of God, believers are not able to do evil things, especially certain evil things recorded in the Old Testament. But in this chapter we read of a brother in the church at Corinth who had committed the sin of incest with his stepmother. Paul’s intention, of course, was to help the church to deal with this evil brother. By reading this chapter we see that it is definitely possible for a truly saved one, a real brother in the Lord, to commit such a sin. If we did not have this record in the New Testament, it probably would be very difficult for us to believe that a saved person could commit this kind of sin. Instead, we may think that after a person has been saved he could never be this sinful. </p>
<p data-content-id="5cvwE7fG0BCj-rNo6NGmlSxcfn8js06QAJSHlTSKtAHd3P8c8SI8FsHkl6iaraK0i"> This chapter also shows us that once a church is diverted from the central vision of God’s economy and gets into <span class="pg" data-page-id="318" id="318">[318]</span> the soul, the door will be open for the lust of the flesh to come in. This will open the way not only for jealousy and strife, but even for gross sins. Therefore, it is extremely dangerous for us to remain in the soul. In this Epistle Paul first deals with the soul and then with the lusts of the flesh. The dealing with the soul is primarily a dealing with division. The first four chapters of this book deal with the problem of division, which comes from the soul. Division is a soulish matter, mainly a matter of the mind. It is the result of opinion, and opinion issues from the mind. This is clearly indicated in the first four chapters. From reading these chapters we see that there were divisions among the Corinthians because they were very much in the natural mind. They turned from the spirit and exercised the soul. They departed from the central vision, and this opened the gate for the lust of the flesh to come in. </p>
<p data-content-id="N9DQWvp40eBT2VybP3ap72SyWkeUtkAvlDPyLCS_h8YrqVB4HFvlImtcJ6D_lT9Tg"> In the church life the soul should not be prevailing. Instead, we all must learn to deny the soul and renounce it and to live in the spirit. We should remain in our spirit and exercise our spirit in every situation. This will close the door to the lust of the flesh. </p>

No sin is worse or more damaging to humanity than incest. As we shall see, although this chapter deals with such a terrible sin, it also speaks of keeping the feast. </p>
<p data-content-id="2x5QcsCAgui9NXQYMVnCg51gf1NTLk96FwAmczHan8nZifIVz9C609J7eMcjMZTbI"> Paul was a person who was full of Christ. He knew Christ experientially and not merely in a doctrinal way. Even as he deals with a gross sin, he still has the enjoyment of Christ within him. </p>
<p data-content-id="uEOnd0iMx5POKDetv2t0ZpmBAFDGOo1C_kpS1IDWbwDZZmpB_EzDqM1j3iDcpaIYK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82157" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:2">verse 2</span> Paul says, “And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that the one who has done this deed might be removed from your midst.” Instead of mourning <span class="pg" data-page-id="319" id="319">[319]</span> that such a gross sin was found among them, the Corinthians were proud and puffed up. No doubt, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82158" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:2">verse 2</span> is a word of rebuke. In this verse Paul also indicates that the one who has committed this sinful deed should be removed from their midst; that is, he should be excommunicated from the fellowship of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="fonV3HEy2MU2N2I0YaxDvgIBiUxgNE7RUiDm88oXAqnMbBjw-ecpzlsiH3gTPoymz"> To remove someone from the fellowship of the church can be compared to removing a decayed or rotten piece of wood from a building. Suppose some wood in a house becomes rotten. This rotten part should be removed. Likewise, the evil brother mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82159" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:1">verse 1</span> should be removed from the fellowship of the church. The Corinthians, however, did not have this realization, for they were still proud and puffed up. For this reason, Paul lets them know that he was deeply concerned about the situation there. </p>
<p data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp4mvlbgQrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen"> In this chapter dealing with an evil brother there are two matters which are very positive and marvelous. The first concerns Paul’s exercise of his human spirit, and the second concerns the feast. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82160" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:3-5">verses 3 through 5</span> Paul says, “For I, being absent in the body, but present in the spirit, have already judged as being present him who so did this, in the name of the Lord Jesus, when you and my spirit are assembled, with the power of our Lord Jesus, to deliver such a one to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82161" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:3">verse 3</span> Paul says that although he was absent in the body, he was present in the spirit. The apostle, as a spiritual person, behaved in his spirit, in contrast to the Corinthians, who behaved either in the soul or in the flesh. Although Paul was absent from them in the body, he was still present with them in the spirit and exercised his spirit to judge the evil person among them. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82162" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:4">verse 4</span> Paul even says that his spirit was assembled with them. The apostle’s spirit was so strong that it attended the Corinthian believers’ meeting. His spirit was assembled with them to carry out his judgment upon the evil person. </p>
<p data-content-id="HGln5zZ0kg7BRF2G3k4ch5kayK9fIchfP4IVVifWdxC7j7vo-3Hmf4N_nWwoJM4tK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82163" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:3-4">verses 3 and 4</span> Paul seems to be saying, “You did not remove the evil person from among you. But through the exercise of my spirit I have already judged him. Although I <span class="pg" data-page-id="320" id="320">[320]</span> am absent from you physically, I am present with you in my spirit. I even attend your meetings in my spirit. Thus, by my spirit I have already judged this one.” </p>
<p data-content-id="XfZ84nrEImIc-Nz7b9qjdkNeXbVUzpA1sSctLSvDe1z-Kgbse9Vggac7oUtrY8Ta8"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82164" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:4">verse 4</span> Paul clearly says, “When you and my spirit are assembled.” By this we know that Paul’s spirit attended the meeting in Corinth. This does not mean, however, that his spirit actually traveled to Corinth. This has absolutely nothing in common with witchcraft, which claims that a person’s soul can leave his body and visit other people. According to this verse, Paul’s spirit was so strong that he could somehow attend the meeting in Corinth. When they were gathered together, his spirit was with them to deliver the evil one to Satan. This is altogether a spiritual matter, something wholly in the spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="k_DHJPbquZertxEnBc6g-ljfw4I_Y_ACkildBPR2ooYdTIhcWKx_8CTD37vjRHlBO"> We should never think that Paul’s spirit actually went to Corinth and attended the meeting. Nevertheless, as the Corinthian believers were meeting together, Paul exercised his spirit to be with them and to judge the evil one and to remove him. We also may learn to visit a brother by our spirit. While we remain at home, it is possible for our spirit to visit a brother. This is what Paul’s spirit did regarding the situation at Corinth. </p>
<p data-content-id="JIZ-QykqNDG1BWmM2KnMOMhZju_iNYeGRi4tcvvoJZcGOh57N2xS8o8hJ8R-wu70-"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82165" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:4">verse 4</span> Paul refers to the name of the Lord Jesus and the power of the Lord Jesus. Both in the name of the Lord and with the power of our Lord Jesus modify deliver in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82166" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:5">verse 5</span>. The apostle, in his spirit, applied the mighty name of the Lord and exercised His power to deliver the evil person to Satan for destruction of the flesh. I definitely believe that this actually transpired and that the evil one was delivered to Satan. </p>

<p data-content-id="1mtnlxhyi5vxsNUaDN97plJIxKXrOz7lTpfX7yGzO2SmNPZ4cC3ocFDiy4eTOiBly"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82190" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:1-11">6:1-11</span> Paul covers the matter of going to secular law. As we read this portion of 1 Corinthians, we need to get into the depths of these verses and not only care for what is written in black and white, but also touch the burden in Paul’s spirit as he was writing. </p>
<p data-content-id="9eaN6Fdd37GIAwbbB4iu5JzKVZeyCcOvavRTlrngEMpuLpI4URJ1klC1LrBzVosWL"> The third problem this Epistle deals with is the matter of one brother going to law against another. This is not a sin like division, which is initiated by the soul, nor a gross sin like incest, which is carried out by the lustful body. This is a case of one claiming his legal rights, not willing to suffer wrong, not willing to learn the lesson of the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="jfI-61Rh_EbH_IA1gDUEXyzj4P3_cZ1Wt-wVWneJ9jg9A32Kw2FtbNOlkIQAhHCHk"> We have pointed out that Paul in this book covers at least ten different problems. The first is the problem of division, and the second that of the gross sin of incest. Third he deals with the problem of a brother who took another brother to a secular law court. Why does Paul make this the third case he deals with and not the second or the fourth? If we would answer this question, we must look into the depths of this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="TgPV7WYzePxLg1dlN-g0NWu5ni7DunVU32z8g7042YLj5QKtSQNXUKE8xxgPy_6YT"> Paul’s burden in writing this Epistle is to deal with the replacements for Christ. The Corinthian believers were replacing Christ with their Greek culture, philosophy, and wisdom. These were all good things, the leading products of society. If we do not have culture, we shall be unrestrained. If we do not have philosophy and wisdom, we shall be foolish. Every human being needs culture, wisdom, and philosophy. The problem among the believers at Corinth was that these good things were replacing Christ. Therefore, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="328" id="328">[328]</span> burden in Paul’s spirit was to bring these believers back to Christ, God’s unique center. </p>
<p data-content-id="nHflLWyF2nFg6U3Z-4mUTN0kfws3Baz2CQ5bqn1TEzR-CESxOjvQhJ575ytY-yo5S"> God’s intention is to work Christ into His chosen people so that Christ may become their life and everything to them and that they may live Christ and thereby in experience become the members of Christ. In this way Christ will have the Body, the church. This vision was in Paul’s spirit as he was writing 1 Corinthians. In this Epistle Paul first deals with the problem of division. Division has its source in the soul, in particular, in the mind. For this reason, Paul deals with the philosophical mind of the Corinthian believers. Then he goes on to deal with a gross sin. This sequence indicates that if Christians live by the soul and by culture instead of Christ, the door will be opened to the lusts of the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="eUZwTHuTDFPfNYOCu1n50UUorE6pAtRKK-PM5-aY_zFf532UtF6kNi_wohlwMw9hh"> It is common for Christians today to take various soulish things as replacements for Christ. This opens the way for the lusts of the flesh to come in. Thus, among God’s redeemed people there are the problems of the soul and of the lusts of the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="5cvwE7fG0BCj-rNo6NGmlSxcfn8js06QAJCHjBiKtAHd3P8c8SI8FsHkl6iaraK0i"> Soulish things are more refined than the lusts of the flesh. Culture enables people to become refined. To be cultured is simply to be refined. The lusts of the flesh, on the contrary, are crude and gross. Nevertheless, whenever people live in the soul, the door is opened wide to the lusts of the flesh. In fact, many times the most sinful and lustful things are done by those who are the most cultured. Often those who are not as highly cultured are not as sinful in their living. It is a fact that in many cases those who are most given to the exercise of the soul are very sinful. On the one hand, they live a soulish life; on the other hand, they indulge in the lusts of the flesh. Many of today’s Christians also follow this trend. </p>
<p data-content-id="N9DQWvp40eBT2VybP3ap72SyWkeUtkAvlDfyCQS_h8YrqVB4HFvlImtcJ6D_lT9Tg"> We have seen that after dealing with the soul and the lustful flesh, Paul turns to the matter of going to secular law. This is a matter of claiming our rights and of not being willing to suffer loss. When we are soulish and fleshly, we shall always claim our rights. We shall not be willing to <span class="pg" data-page-id="329" id="329">[329]</span> be wronged by anyone. For this reason, Paul makes the third dealing in this Epistle that of claiming one’s personal rights. This problem was found among the believers at Corinth. </p>
<p data-content-id="tiNQgxDpsd4NWazI4KY7Ls3Zc1jf31TN8mW0omJv7jbyJhqTUCAeHZ8B89sG6uKJy"> The problem of claiming our rights is found not only in society and in the church, but also in married life. If a husband and wife live in the soul and according to their lusts, both will claim their rights. Neither will be willing to give in to the other. Only when we live in the spirit are we willing to give in and not insist on our rights. When we have a life by the mingled spirit, we shall not claim any rights for ourselves. It may seem to us that we do not have any rights to claim. The reason we claim our rights is that instead of living by the mingled spirit, we live in the soul and in the flesh. Because the soulish life was prevailing and because the door was open to the lusts of the flesh, there were lawsuits among the believers in Corinth. The sequence is that first we have a soulish life, then the lusts of the flesh, and then the claiming of our rights. </p>

As co-kings with Christ, these overcoming saints will judge the world in the coming age. Since the world will be judged by the saints, they are certainly worthy of the smallest judgments. These judgments are those carried out by a number of saints judging cases among themselves, cases which are trifling compared to the ruling of the world. Here Paul seems to be saying, “If you will be able to judge great things, are you not able to judge the small things today? Why don’t you let the saints <span class="pg" data-page-id="330" id="330">[330]</span> judge your cases? Why do you bring your case to unbelievers for judgment?” </p>

This probably refers to the judgment over the angels revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82196" data-verses="2Peter 2:4">2 Peter 2:4</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82197" data-verses="Jude 1:6">Jude 6</span>.

<p data-content-id="Zjyvva9_mwbWU7v14CMragfkXMl76M85AKoYsli2npxvRcj28K_niY4FY2FqTLVIx"> In 1 Corinthians Paul deals with matters in a particular sequence. First he deals with soulish desires and aspirations; second, with the fleshly lusts; and third, with the claiming of rights. As we have pointed out, this sequence is very meaningful. In this message we come to Paul’s dealing with the abuse of freedom in foods and in the body, the fourth matter covered in this Epistle. </p>
<p data-content-id="A3Oa3UPcjrJzR4wlouzXCJftgWRSWHHN8LWGy6cifE_yD30wsSCVCR1Rhevz1xRO7"> Foods for man to exist and marriage for man to propagate himself are both necessary and ordained by God. Man has the right to use them. However, he should not abuse them, nor should he be under their power, controlled and enslaved by them. Abusive eating, like the eating of sacrifices to idols, causes the weak brothers to stumble (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82226" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:9-13">8:9-13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82227" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:28-30">10:28-30</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82228" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:32">32</span>), and excessive eating damages our body. Both foods and our belly will be done away with; God will bring both to nothing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82229" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:13">6:13</span>). The abuse of sex is fornication. It is not only condemned by God; it also destroys our body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82230" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:18">v. 18</span>), which is for the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="F_0pIc17fjqQrLFCajrHceBnEm3EkINB6qou0fMW-twLqCp0pOLPqCxrSvbNiuAOt"> Both eating and marriage have been ordained by God and are necessary for the existence of mankind. If mankind is to continue on earth for the fulfillment of God’s purpose, there is the need for eating and for marriage. Food is not only created by God, but also ordained by Him for our existence. Marriage is for the propagation of mankind. Because eating and marriage are both ordained by God, both are legal. In each case we have freedom, the freedom to eat and <span class="pg" data-page-id="338" id="338">[338]</span> the freedom to marry. However, fallen man has abused his freedom in these matters. For this reason, after dealing with soulish aspirations, fleshly lusts, and the claiming of rights, Paul turns to the matter of the abuse of freedom. </p>
<p data-content-id="CFF3xQmaFvwJ5j4xk2Wr_M9AHisFFvvZHyojp81hhQwaE4qISeDhS6DHqSHn3a8XL"> Some teachers of the Bible do not regard <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82231" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:12-18">6:12-18</span> as a separate section. Instead, they place it with the following two sections, the sections on marriage and the problem of eating idol sacrifices. This portion is considered an introduction to the following two sections, since these verses deal with eating and marriage. Many years ago, I did not think that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82232" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:12-18">6:12-18</span> was an individual section. But after reading this book again and again over many years, I now believe that these verses are a separate section dealing with the abuse of human freedom. </p>
<p data-content-id="JIZ-QykqNDG1BWmM2KnMOMhZju_iNYeGRhYtctvoJZcGOh57N2xS8o8hJ8R-wu70-"> We have seen that soulish people open the door to the lusts of the flesh and that fleshly people will insist on claiming their rights. Following this comes the abuse of freedom. In the church the soul must be denied. This is the basis for the church life on the negative side. On the positive side, the basis of the church life is the truth regarding Christ and His cross. In the church life we all must learn to deny the soul; that is, not to give any ground, occasion, or opening for the soul to do anything. Once the believers in a church become soulish, the church life is terminated, for the door will be open to the lusts of the flesh, and these lusts will give rise to the claiming of rights. There will even be the building up of a base both for claiming rights and for the abuse of human freedom. As we consider these matters, we realize that the sequence in which Paul deals with the problems in Corinthians is marvelous. </p>

<p data-content-id="b6PkOnBRxPH-JZwYqEGn8CHT8qNMfaW8BfVW5pQUwlEPRETelPUlRIL-iaR1qLEZU"> Paul opens this section with these words: “All things are lawful to me, but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.” The Greek word rendered lawful literally means <span class="pg" data-page-id="339" id="339">[339]</span> under my power of choice to do; hence, permissible, allowable, lawful. The word for expedient means profitable (not merely convenient), advantageous, good, worthwhile. This Greek word means profitable, economical, convenient, helpful in reaching the goal quickly. It also refers to things that are good. Here Paul’s thought may be that all things are lawful, but not all things help us to remain in the central lane of God’s economy. All things are lawful, but not all things help us in bearing the cross or are profitable in experiencing Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="qPvGt579Xg2208_F-Y_Px3PmmtBqvIPpncY-gHPjo8q_UxMIXkBSVMp3PZrkIuHbS"> If we would understand Paul’s use of the word expedient here, we need to have a proper realization concerning the book of Corinthians as a whole. All things are lawful to us, but not all things help us to gain the profit revealed in this Epistle. Not all things help us to live the Body life. Yes, you may be free to do certain things, but those things will not help you in the church life, and they will not strengthen your prayer life. If we apply what Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82233" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:12">6:12</span> according to the context of the entire book of 1 Corinthians, we shall see that Paul’s word here is all-inclusive. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82234" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:12">6:12</span> Paul seems to be saying, “All things are lawful to me, but not all things are good, profitable, convenient, or economical for me to live the Christian life, the church life, and the Body life. Not all things help me to enjoy Christ or keep the feast of unleavened bread.” </p>

Paul says, “All things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.” Literally the Greek words rendered “be brought under the power of” mean to be brought under the authority of. All things are under my power, but I will not be brought under the power (authority) of anything. All things are permissible, allowable, lawful, to me, but I will not be ruled (enslaved) or brought under the authority, the control, of any. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82236" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:12">Verse 12</span> may be considered a proverb that governs the <span class="pg" data-page-id="340" id="340">[340]</span> apostle’s dealings with some problems in the following section, from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82237" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:13">6:13 through 11:1</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="0lPdjYmGFHiI5J5XxCYQsri-H6UWaL3fQY4mQmJY3_7MOfbRgf2qmCmeLk8UjNCJ1"> When you consider whether or not to do a certain thing, you should ask if you are under the power or control of that thing. If a particular thing controls you or has power over you, you should not do it. For example, you may wonder if you should eat certain foods. It may be all right to eat those foods, but they should not have any power over you. We must fully deal with anything that has power over us. </p>

By themselves they do not mean anything; God will bring them to nothing. </p>
<p data-content-id="xedXR7KyftfYy5rRtYIjXLRf-xguDXvOpeMaLWdIn7rjMRQgLiFkUjZ1Br4qBKkUQ"> Paul’s composition here may seem awkward. He says, “God will bring to nothing both it and them.” If we were writing this verse, we might say, “God will bring both to nothing.” However, if the verse were written in this way, the meaning and significance would be lost. By referring to “both it and them,” Paul means both the belly and the foods. He refers to the belly first because God will bring it to nothing before He brings foods to nothing. The reason for this is that the abuse of freedom in the matter of eating is not caused by the food; it is caused by the belly. The problem comes not from the food itself, but from the belly. After a person’s belly has been brought to nothing, food will no longer be a problem. Food is for the belly, and the belly is for food. God uses these things so that we may exist for the fulfillment of His purpose. But one day God will bring both the belly and the foods to nothing. </p>

This union is illustrated by that of the branches with the vine (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82271" data-verses="John 15:4-5">John 15:4-5</span>).

When we read these verses, however, we may take them for granted and may not spend adequate time to study them and the important matters revealed in them. How much time have you spent on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82290" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:15">verse 15</span>, which says that our bodies are members of Christ? Very few believers have paid the proper attention to this verse. Yes, messages have been given on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82291" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:19">verse 19</span>, messages on the believers’ body as a temple of the Holy Spirit. But <span class="pg" data-page-id="347" id="347">[347]</span> before you came into the Lord’s recovery, did you ever hear a message on being one spirit with the Lord? Did you ever hear a message on being joined to the Lord as one spirit? These three matters deserve thorough study. I do not mean merely the study of the black and white letters of the Word, but a study in the light of experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="RKpt0z8nFNlHi_3vAHu8OcgGgYOj-shs7EeS2ubEU8dkYiKR-u6Z0ZA1R2xXn3ai4"> Rarely do Christians today practice being one spirit with the Lord. Do you know of a book, or even a message, entitled “One Spirit with the Lord”? Due to the influence of traditional theology and practice, most Christians are not able to digest a verse like <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82292" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">6:17</span>. There seems to be no room in them for the vital matter of being one spirit with the Lord. However, they may have a great deal of room in them for such matters as holiness, victory, power, miracles, and speaking in tongues. Certain Christians in Pentecostalism place great emphasis on speaking in tongues. In some cases they do not care whether or not the tongues-speaking is genuine. Because they are so fond of speaking in tongues, they do not care much for proper prayers and do not care at all for the central vision of Paul’s completing ministry. If someone speaks in tongues, these believers easily become excited. But if someone prays, “Lord, thank You for Your mercy and grace,” they quickly become disinterested. They have no heart for this kind of prayer. Furthermore, should you speak to them of the vision of God’s economy, they would not be able to understand what you are saying. Do you think it is possible for such persons to know the Word of God? No, they cannot know the Word, for there is no room in them for the crucial matters of God’s revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="sekrxE0ekH4YzjuJnZ6t8c3cdplKbmWoZ7CtdcsSkFLy5jYO71G6nuPBp_WYYIECE"> The situation of many Christians today is similar to that of the disciples of the Lord Jesus who did not have the capacity to take in the Lord’s word regarding the bread of life. The Lord said that He was the bread of life, that He came down from heaven to give life, that His flesh was edible and His blood drinkable, and that whoever ate Him would live by Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82293" data-verses="John 6:33">John 6:33</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82294" data-verses="John 6:35">35</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82295" data-verses="John 6:55">55</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82296" data-verses="John 6:57">57</span>). Those who could not receive the Lord’s word said, “This is a hard word; who can hear it?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82297" data-verses="John 6:60">John 6:60</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="348" id="348">[348]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="wIQrvVteeI1oKV87cJZVVv5dOgX231XUsqVUyRHr25XvLEhXjHSjbC3_2HzXXD3x4"> We also may be very limited in our capacity to receive God’s revelation. Due to the drugging influence of religion and tradition, we may not be able to take in Paul’s word about being one spirit with the Lord, or his word about our bodies being the members of Christ. We may be like a person who eats garlic or who stays in a room filled with the smell of garlic, and thus becomes insensitive to the taste and smell of garlic. Such a person’s sense of smell may become so accustomed to garlic that he regards this smell as normal. In the same principle, our spiritual senses of smell and taste, in fact, our whole inner being, may be so much under the influence of traditional Christianity that we do not have the ability to perceive certain crucial matters of God’s economy. If this is our situation, we may read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82298" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:1">1 Corinthians 6</span> again and again without being impressed by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82299" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:15">verses 15</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82300" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">17</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="LCOBHh-_8rtpkoOSBhuJ3SLJouiGtADmReLcFmbK7WCcffclCOEo5EYkos9Kc9G0W"> For many years I also read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82301" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:1">1 Corinthians 6</span> without seeing the crucial significance of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82302" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">verse 17</span>. But one day this verse began to be opened up to me. It was as if I had never read this verse before. I asked myself if such a verse was actually in the Bible. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82303" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">verse 17</span> Paul clearly says, “He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.” From that time onward, I began to give a great deal of attention to this verse and to exercise myself to experience it. </p>
<p data-content-id="mA_96h-ZPzHjy0DOYoWw3UVdng1dAcNQKaa0ges6FnoHymfKQciucRWHW48k6Jjdb"> In 1947 and 1948 Brother Nee often stressed the need to exercise the spirit and release the spirit. He often said that in all we do, preaching the gospel, contacting the saints, and ministering the Word, we must exercise our spirit and release our spirit. He also pointed out that the part of our being which we use the most is the part that we emphasize. For example, if a person lives in the mind, his mind will be prominent whenever he speaks. Likewise, a person who lives in the emotion will express his emotion. I was greatly helped by this fellowship, and from that time onward, I endeavored to exercise the spirit and to release the spirit. However, I had not yet been impressed with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82304" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">6:17</span>. </p>

The order in which Paul deals with the problems is not careless or insignificant. On the contrary, the sequence is full of significance. First, Paul deals with the soulish desires and aspirations; second, with the fleshly lusts; third, with the claiming of rights; and fourth, with the abuse of human freedom in the God-ordained matters of eating and marriage. As we shall see, Paul goes on in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82312" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:1">chapter seven</span> to deal with married life and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82313" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:1">chapters eight</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82314" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:1">nine</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82315" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:1">ten</span>, to deal with the eating of meat sacrificed to idols. These six dealings form a group. Every matter in this group is a matter of life. The soul, the flesh, rights, freedom, marriage, and eating are all related to human living. </p>
<p data-content-id="8mSjN8Zzt62gkGo0MycXHksy-YBKtJWbd45v_dyOa49_JwqOmHn6fmadytYtxsWL6"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82316" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">chapters eleven through sixteen</span> Paul deals with five other problems. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82317" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">chapter eleven</span> he deals with head covering and the Lord’s table. Head covering is related to Christ as the Head, and the Lord’s table is related to the church as Christ’s Body. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82318" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapters twelve</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82319" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">thirteen</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82320" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">fourteen</span> Paul deals with spiritual gifts; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82321" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> he covers the doctrine of resurrection; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82322" data-verses="1Corinthians 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> he comes to the last matter, the giving of material things. These five matters form a second group and are all related to spiritual <span class="pg" data-page-id="354" id="354">[354]</span> things concerning God’s administration. The more we consider the sequence in which Paul deals with problems in this Epistle, the more we realize the significance of this sequence. We shall see that the first six problems are a group related to human life and that the last five are a group related to spiritual things, in particular related to God’s interests on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="0lPdjYmGFHiI5J5XxCYQsri-H6UWaL3fXa4mY1ZY3_7MOfbRgf2qmCmeLk8UjNCJ1"> One way to study 1 Corinthians is to trace the sequence of the eleven problems dealt with in this book.

But when he deals with these things, he uses certain excellent expressions and utterances to present matters that are not covered elsewhere in the New Testament. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82324" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:8">5:8</span> Paul says, “Let us therefore keep the feast.” We have seen that this feast refers to the feast of unleavened bread as a continuation of the Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82325" data-verses="Exodus 12:15-20">Exo. 12:15-20</span>). It lasted seven days, a period of completion, signifying the entire period of our Christian life, from the day of our conversion to the day of rapture. This indicates that the entire Christian life should be a feast, an enjoyment of Christ as our banquet. </p>
<p data-content-id="BlFnrZica4yWuQnA7t-H0gDU5fwQYidCyRxvHO3utg7GeZB2ROy6rbjikKwq_wK8F"> Although keeping the feast of unleavened bread is a matter of great importance, most Christians pay little attention to Paul’s word concerning it. Instead, they concentrate on Paul’s commands for wives to submit themselves to their husbands and for husbands to love their wives. These concepts are already part of the natural understanding both of believers and of unbelievers. The Chinese began to practice these things thousands of years ago. If from the Bible you teach certain ethical Chinese that wives should submit to their husbands and that husbands should love their wives, <span class="pg" data-page-id="355" id="355">[355]</span> they may tell you that they already know these things and practice them. </p>
<p data-content-id="xedXR7KyftfYy5rRtYIjXLRf-xguDXvOucMaIW9In7rjMRQgLiFkUjZ1Br4qBKkUQ"> Although Christians pay attention to verses about submission and love, who pays adequate attention to Paul’s word about keeping the feast? Do the professors in Bible schools and seminaries teach their students what it means to keep the feast and how to keep the feast? It is doubtful that any professor instructs his students concerning these things. Furthermore, I doubt that anyone has ever told you what it means for your body to be a member of Christ, to be joined to the Lord as one spirit, or for your body to be the temple of the Holy Spirit. How sad that today’s believers have been distracted from these crucial matters! We also have been hindered by the influence of our religious background. Thus, there is the need for us to get into <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82326" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:15">verses 15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82327" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">17</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82328" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:19">19</span>. We can no longer afford to neglect such verses; these are some of the deepest verses in the Bible. </p>

But the body is not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. And God has raised up the Lord and will raise up us through His power.” Our body was created for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body. God has raised up the Lord bodily, and our body will participate in the Lord’s glorious body in resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82330" data-verses="Philippians 3:21">Phil. 3:21</span>) and be raised incorruptible. This will be the redemption of our body. </p>
<p data-content-id="QM-bErH4QMuLGtlKhNiUmVseR6-Mo4MAIYGMZ95bAWzUJ836Exkha9TFHxEakh9zT"> Speaking of the resurrected Christ, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82331" data-verses="Acts 2:24">Acts 2:24</span> says, “Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82332" data-verses="Romans 6:9">Romans 6:9</span>, “Christ having been raised from among the dead dies no more; death lords it over Him no more.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82333" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:14">2 Corinthians 4:14</span> Paul says clearly that the One who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up: “Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.” Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82334" data-verses="John 6:39-40">John 6:39 and 40</span> the Lord Jesus promises that He <span class="pg" data-page-id="356" id="356">[356]</span> will raise us up in the last day. But even today the Spirit of the resurrected Christ gives life to our body, thereby making it a member of Christ and a temple of God indwelt by the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="K9Fhzhq9ETFPCPzdkFWRrkfkDyu0qmgIvxi5siP0zVrET7fYv2qxzXlZDmd0Kk9SX"> If we would understand how the Lord today is for our body and how in the future God will resurrect our body, we need to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82335" data-verses="Romans 8:11">Romans 8:11</span>. This verse says, “But if the Spirit of Him Who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He Who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit Who indwells you.” In this verse, one of the greatest verses in the Bible, we see that through the indwelling Spirit of the very God who raised up Jesus from among the dead, life is imparted into our mortal body. This may be the present experience of all who seek the Lord. If you truly seek the Lord, something marvelous is taking place within you: the Spirit of the resurrecting God is imparting life into your body. </p>
<p data-content-id="ldCSVKCXVHzwbcJAktI5qY9WW0m-zAHEewRHCYCwzcGvha9kv82E6htYPVBgcHt9H"> This imparting of life may be illustrated by the transmission of electricity. The current of electricity is actually electricity in motion. If you look at the electric meter in the meeting hall, you will realize that electricity is being transmitted into the building. As we meet in the hall to pray and fellowship, electricity is flowing into the building. In the same principle, the heavenly electricity of Christ’s resurrection life is flowing into our mortal bodies. As we seek the Lord day by day, we can have the full assurance that the divine current is flowing within us. This current is the resurrection life imparted into us through the indwelling Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="OT5FVjm4b3rEEp9If2G1UsfkTjficISBNnQujKTvH9vLo8q-qnrQL8cvvI2WkbUHd"> I often experience this transmission when I am physically tired. Many times I must speak even when my body is very tired. But while I am speaking, the Spirit is infused into me, and the resurrected Christ becomes my life supply. As a result, my spirit is strengthened and my weak, tired body is enlivened. </p>

The subject of these verses is the abuse of freedom in foods and in the body. Thus, Paul’s concern is the believers’ body. </p>

<p data-content-id="QM-bErH4QMuLGtlKhNiUmVseR6-Mo4MAIYWMeu5bAWzUJ836Exkha9TFHxEakh9zT"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82354" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:1-40">7:1-40</span> Paul comes to the fifth problem dealt with in this Epistle—the matter of marriage. This is treated according to the principles established in the preceding section (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82355" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:12-20">6:12-20</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="K9Fhzhq9ETFPCPzdkFWRrkfkDyu0qmgIvxy5qxf0zVrET7fYv2qxzXlZDmd0Kk9SX"> Many times those who are most cultured are the ones who have the most problems in married life. Those who are simple and uncultured may not have as many marriage problems. If you study the statistics related to divorces in this country, you will find that a large percentage of divorces is among those who are highly educated and among professional people. It seems that the more educated a person is, the greater is the possibility of divorce. Because the Corinthians were so devoted to their culture and philosophy, they had many questions about marriage. Paul answers these questions in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82356" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:1">chapter seven</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="ldCSVKCXVHzwbcJAktI5qY9WW0m-zAHEewBHLIiwzcGvha9kv82E6htYPVBgcHt9H"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82357" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:1">First Corinthians 7:1</span> begins in this way: “Now concerning the things of which you wrote.” This indicates that the Corinthians had written to Paul about various matters, including marriage. The believers at Corinth had many questions because they were philosophical. They philosophized about everything. It is dangerous, however, to philosophize about our married life, for this can lead to separation or even divorce. Brother Nee once advised us that after we get married, we should be blind regarding our spouse. If we do this, we shall enjoy married life. But if we are watchful over our husband or wife in a critical, philosophical way, we shall have serious problems. To analyze our <span class="pg" data-page-id="362" id="362">[362]</span> married life is to philosophize concerning marriage. Instead of analyzing our married life, we should simply enjoy it, praising the Lord and thanking Him for the spouse He has given us. The more we praise the Lord in this way, the more we shall enjoy married life. </p>
<p data-content-id="OT5FVjm4b3rEEp9If2G1UsfkTjficISBNnAurajvH9vLo8q-qnrQL8cvvI2WkbUHd"> Probably all those who are married have spent some time analyzing their marriage. We may have said to ourselves, “Was it really of the Lord that I marry this one? Perhaps I was influenced too much by others. Maybe I should have waited a little longer.” If we are honest, we shall admit that we have asked questions such as these. These questions arise because, deep within, we are not wholly satisfied with our married life. Just as every Christian has had doubts concerning his salvation, so every married person has had doubts about married life. Of course, I do not encourage you to question your married life. I am simply pointing out the fact that questions seem to be unavoidable, especially among those who are educated and highly cultured. </p>

I believe that this is the best way to understand the many points covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82358" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:1">chapter seven</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="LCOBHh-_8rtpkoOSBhuJ3SLJouiGtADmWcLcGm7K7WCcffclCOEo5EYkos9Kc9G0W">A.

In this verse Paul says, “It is good for a man not to touch a woman.” This depends upon the gift from God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82360" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:7">v. 7</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Zjyvva9_mwbWU7v14CMragfkXMl76M85HI4Yr2C2npxvRcj28K_niY4FY2FqTLVIx">B. Devoting Ourselves to Prayer</h2><p data-content-id="A3Oa3UPcjrJzR4wlouzXCJftgWRSWHHN7JGG0psifE_yD30wsSCVCR1Rhevz1xRO7"> Speaking to married believers, Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82361" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:5">verse 5</span>, “Do not deprive each other, except by agreement for a time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer and again be together, that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.” The Greek word rendered devote literally means have leisure, be free for; hence, to give oneself to. Prayer requires that we be free from persons, matters, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="363" id="363">[363]</span> things. Any prayer that requires staying away from the spouse for a time must be special and heavy. </p>
<p data-content-id="F_0pIc17fjqQrLFCajrHceBnEm3EkINB9o4u9MMW-twLqCp0pOLPqCxrSvbNiuAOt"> Married life often distracts us from prayer and interferes with our prayer life. It may even keep us from praying altogether. However, there are unusual cases where a husband and wife help one another in the prayer life. But for the most part, marriage is a distraction from the prayer life. </p>

He desires them not to marry but to remain as he that they also may be absolute for the Lord’s interests without distraction (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82365" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:33">vv. 33</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82366" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:35">35</span>). In this wish he expresses the Lord’s aspiration concerning His called ones. </p>
<p data-content-id="vFgafReeId0NLp6vSzTQo14EsX_DOCFdzQvaOpYgGNBc9CrkwduxPEplaAWErKNdi"> For a believer in Christ to be able not to marry is a gift from God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82367" data-verses="Matthew 19:10-12">Matt. 19:10-12</span>). For those who have not received such a gift, it is better to marry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82368" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:9">1 Cor. 7:9</span>). It all depends upon the gift we have received from God. If a person does not have the gift not to marry and yet deliberately refrains from marrying, he will face difficulties and may damage himself. Married life is troublesome. But if anyone does not have the gift, the ability, not to marry, that one should marry and accept its troubles. Otherwise, by choosing not to be married, he may have even greater difficulties. </p>

Later, after witnessing the actual outcome, he charged young widows to marry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82373" data-verses="1Timothy 5:11-15">1 Tim. 5:11-15</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="uEOnd0iMx5POKDetv2t0ZpmBAFDGOo1C4lZS2JjWbwDZZmpB_EzDqM1j3iDcpaIYK"> According to Paul’s word in this verse, it is good for a believer to remain unmarried. However, we are not able to fulfill this word without receiving the necessary gift from the Lord. </p>

The Greek word for present may also mean that the presence of a certain thing foreshadows and inaugurates something to come. The present necessity or distress indicates more anguish to come, as prophesied by the Lord in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82375" data-verses="Matthew 24:8">Matthew 24:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82376" data-verses="Matthew 24:19">19</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82377" data-verses="Matthew 24:21">21</span>. The word rendered necessity means force, constraint; hence, distress, anguish. It refers to the needs of the life in the present age, the demand of which constrains and presses people and becomes a distress and anguish to them. Therefore, it is good to remain unmarried (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82378" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:27">vv. 27</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82379" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:40">40a</span>). </p>

The Greek word for self-control here also means continency. The same Greek word is used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82381" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:25">9:25</span> for athletes abstaining from sensual indulgences during preparation for the games. </p>

Here we have the principle of remaining in marriage that the unbelieving party may be saved. This means that a believer who is married to an unbeliever should not take the initiative to give up that marriage. Instead of seeking to change his status, he should remain in the married life in order to save the unbelieving party. </p>

On the contrary, his emphasis is mainly on the troubles and distractions related to married life. The reason for this emphasis is that here he is answering questions raised by the Corinthians. As we have pointed out, thoughtful, philosophical people have many questions about marriage. To answer the questions raised by the Corinthian believers, Paul sets forth a number of basic principles concerning married life. It is profitable to consider these principles, for they help to answer our questions and also bring us into the enjoyment of blessing in our married life. </p>

In a sense, human life is simply married life. The matters involving our work and daily living are related to married life. For this reason, we may say that married life represents human living. </p>
<p data-content-id="45d-EDyyRdejyAtIco9vv--MfBFfH5nEc2CwQ-_J1z9MAZSXg-0MsBpqMhRa6rO3L"> In answering the questions raised by the Corinthians concerning married life, Paul was simple, direct, frank, and genuine. He did not say anything ambiguous or speak in a political way. Furthermore, he answered all the questions according to his Christian experience. This is why he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82431" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:7">verse 7</span>, “I wish all men to be even as myself.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82432" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:8">verse 8</span> he declares, “It is good for them if they remain even as I.” This indicates that Paul answers the questions concerning marriage according to what he is in his being and living. Thus, if we would have a thorough understanding of this chapter, we need to ask what Paul lived for. Paul was an absolute person. His spirit was absolute for the Lord and His economy. As we read this chapter, we realize that Paul’s aspiration was for all the believers to imitate him and follow him in being for the Lord. Here Paul seems to be saying, “I am absolute <span class="pg" data-page-id="371" id="371">[371]</span> for the Lord, and I hope that you will all be the same. In this matter I want you all to follow me.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="oHvwn1F9kPbTytIPVynf_MGPeusawFjhVrJMyO7fRRrtjdCyM9IgKVBeI7sBRsMLT">NOT INITIATING ANYTHING</h2><p data-content-id="3E2ZRbJydxokD8WKMAIbtFfHb0jzb68DkKrroqmbxR9wRW14_fX2fsKcexAdJrzWM"> Paul was not only absolute for the Lord, but he was also absolutely one with God. Because Paul was one with God, he answered the questions in such a way that the Corinthians would be helped to be one with Him in every circumstance, condition, and situation. We know this by the fact that in answering certain questions Paul followed the principle of not initiating anything or changing anything. He made it very clear to the Corinthians that they should not initiate any action or change their status in any way. </p>
<p data-content-id="GBDJJALJ0cF4ks8AH19ucJjnWsP4LTnCHAIKC7XhfQlZ2XYUYk_NIq7g1JKhMOSI_"> If we change our status or initiate any action, this is an indication that we are not one with God and that we do not want to be one with Him. If we like to be one with God and are actually one with Him, we shall not initiate any change, especially change related to married life. On the contrary, our attitude will be, “If God wants me to marry, let Him initiate it and work it out. If God does not want me to marry, surely He will grant me the gift I need to remain unmarried.” This gift will produce a willingness, even a desire, to remain unmarried; it also will supply the ability to remain single. However, no one should make such a decision on his own. It must be God who takes the initiative and who grants us both the desire and the gift to remain unmarried. Paul was not married. However, he did not make this decision on his own. Rather, it was initiated by God, and God gave Paul the necessary desire and ability. This was the gift he received from the Lord. To repeat, whether we should marry or not, we should not initiate anything. We must leave this matter to the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="c72SBDvLnZO0HTNpK_Y1vJj4uYnRW9aV2IGG7suhmUkJUykeLnr0FNqIv6PWDSSzw"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82433" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:1">1 Corinthians 7</span> Paul makes it very clear to the Corinthians that they should not change their status or initiate anything. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82434" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:12">verse 12</span> he says, “If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to dwell with him, let him not leave her.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82435" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:13">verse 13</span> Paul says the same thing to a believing wife: “And a wife who has an unbelieving husband and he <span class="pg" data-page-id="372" id="372">[372]</span> consents to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82436" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:17-24">verses 17 through 24</span> we see that we should remain in the status of our calling. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82437" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:17">verse 17</span> Paul strongly charges us to remain in the state of marriage in which God has called us: “Only as the Lord has allotted to each one, as God has called each one, so let him walk.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82438" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:20">verse 20</span> Paul goes on to say, “Each one, in the calling in which he was called, in this let him remain.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82439" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:24">verse 24</span> he concludes, “Each one, brothers, in what state he was called, in this let him remain with God.” This indicates that the believers must be one with God and have God with them in their situation, no matter what it may be. These examples indicate that Paul was absolutely one with God and wanted the Corinthian believers to be one with Him and not to initiate any change or action. </p>
<p data-content-id="YAf-ThL_BpKj4Bal8Hh8S_ZBAgDwrplD4fuUCFM4sdE5fnGiiRPa9o6wxsU4R57wn"> The Corinthian believers, however, were very different from Paul. Instead of being absolutely one with the Lord, they exercised their wisdom and philosophy. They philosophized about everything, including marriage. Some thought that it was better not to get married, whereas others strongly preferred married life. The way the Corinthians thought and spoke about marriage indicated that among them there was a great deal of human initiative. Therefore, in answering their questions, Paul indicates strongly that in the matter of marriage we should not initiate anything. </p>
<p data-content-id="EKLQNzB20IJMJNZAsXkVbasdhWNIKYBtSk30sIgDmdSh2KIOAd4oaYB8TBbVW9IBJ"> In this chapter we see that Paul’s spirit was absolutely one with God. Paul was not willing to change anything or to initiate anything. This was the reason he could tell the Corinthians not to change their status as far as marriage was concerned. Those who were married when called by the Lord should remain married. This principle applies even to marriage with an unbeliever. The married believer should not initiate any change. On the contrary, the entire matter should be left with God. Whether the unbelieving party remains or leaves, the believing one should take the situation from the Lord. Everything depends on God and on the situations, circumstances, and conditions arranged by Him. </p>

In this message we shall consider the very important matter of the apostle’s teaching. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VAmSFImgVrwWBDh3eU1j3ZFZPnAW6HkY9JOA5IZXxzEgwGujPfsebgBAiBEiWFZI6">II. THE APOSTLE’S TEACHING</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="imdufFGU1VpsTYYg4sAVUG-TWWELatFvRm83Ob27L7B-Rv1HfZsOuLeAEkuDTcJUK">A. In the Principle of Incarnation </h2>
<p data-content-id="1mtnlxhyi5vxsNUaDN97plJIxKXrOz7lUofX3yGzO2SmNPZ4cC3ocFDiy4eTOiBly"> The Apostle Paul’s teaching is absolutely different from the teaching of the prophets in the Old Testament. We are told that when the prophets spoke for God in Old Testament times, the word of the Lord came to them and enabled them to speak on God’s behalf. Often the prophets would say, “Thus saith the Lord.” Many of those in today’s Pentecostalism follow this Old Testament practice. Catholicism brings people back to the Old Testament in ritual, but Pentecostalism brings the believers back to the Old Testament in the way of prophesying. Furthermore, according to my experience, Pentecostal believers more often sing portions of the Old Testament than they do portions of the New Testament. In particular, they sing verses from Psalms or Isaiah. Although they are New Testament believers, certain of their practices are according to the Old Testament. To say, “Thus saith the Lord,” in the Old Testament way is shallow and superficial. The New Testament way of speaking for the Lord is very different. </p>
<p data-content-id="PxQUR1aSfVg1g5EN0uN6GBmA7oa_DRqoCBI2oKF94p-AdYjLrSH1ujpvA-dj4BNGp"> The New Testament has two outstanding characteristics—it is mysterious and deep. The New Testament is a <span class="pg" data-page-id="378" id="378">[378]</span> book of mysteries and depths. It is very superficial to prophesy according to the Old Testament way. But to prophesy in the way of building up the church is deep. Likewise, to sing portions from the Psalms or Isaiah may be superficial, but to sing the third chapter of Ephesians, especially those verses about Christ making His home in our hearts so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God, is to sing about things that are deep, profound, and mysterious. Do you know of any Christians today who sing about being one spirit with the Lord, or about their bodies being members of Christ? As we have seen, Paul speaks of such matters in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82453" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:1">1 Corinthians 6</span>. Nevertheless, to many believers Paul’s words are like a foreign language. These believers live on the surface; they have never touched the depths of the divine revelation in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="-31E-FlFhHZVWfRVsibLPN9Po-xOz3xA1PZ5Vv-NyImqaLANCOsF5aHepDtdpWJmP"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82454" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:1">First Corinthians 7</span> is mysterious and deep. In this chapter Paul never utters the words, “Thus saith the Lord.” The reason Paul does not use such an expression is that the apostles’ teaching in the New Testament is altogether based on the principle of incarnation. According to this principle, God speaks in man’s speaking. When the Lord Jesus spoke, it was difficult for others to discern who was speaking. To be sure, it was a man who was speaking. However, this man did not declare, “I am a prophet from Nazareth. Last night, the word of God came to me, and now I want to speak this word to you. Thus saith the Lord.” When the Lord Jesus spoke to the Pharisees, it seems that He was an ordinary person from Nazareth. There was no indication that He was different, and the Pharisees regarded Him as a man without learning. But the Lord Jesus is God incarnate. With Him there is the reality of incarnation. Thus, while He was speaking, God spoke also. Actually, His speaking was God’s speaking. God spoke with Him. This means that in the Lord Jesus God and man spoke together as one. This is the principle of incarnation. </p>
<p data-content-id="prVBOIVQEyCQk7WbC65wKBFpZIyHUt92qJaJiga3N6sMf93hlzv0FeRHAEKBhJS-J"> On the day of Pentecost the apostles and disciples also began to speak according to the principle of incarnation. This is the reason the writings of Peter, John, and Paul <span class="pg" data-page-id="379" id="379">[379]</span> recorded in the Bible could become God’s words. Furthermore, these words are among the contents of the New Testament. Although Paul writes in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82455" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:1">1 Corinthians 7</span> that certain things he says are not the Lord’s word or the Lord’s commandment, everything spoken by Paul in this chapter has nonetheless become part of the divine revelation in the New Testament. This is because Paul was a person absolutely one with God. Even when he says that he does not have a word from the Lord, the Lord speaks in his speaking. Because Paul was one with the Lord, when he spoke, the Lord spoke with him. Thus, with Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82456" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:1">1 Corinthians 7</span> we have an example of the principle of incarnation. It is very important that we see this principle and understand it. </p>

However, what Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82458" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:1-5">7:1-5</span> is by way of concession, not by command. </p>

But the New Testament principle of incarnation is “I charge;” that is, the speaker charges. The speaker and the Lord are one. Hence, Paul also says, “Not I but the Lord.” The Greek word for charge may also be translated enjoin or command. </p>
<p data-content-id="fonV3HEy2MU2N2I0YaxDvgIBiUxgNE7RTjTm89oXAqnMbBjw-ecpzlsiH3gTPoymz"> The words “I charge, not I but the Lord,” indicate two things: first, that the apostle is one with the Lord; hence, what he commands, the Lord commands. Second, his commandments are the Lord’s. What Paul commands here the <span class="pg" data-page-id="380" id="380">[380]</span> Lord had already commanded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82464" data-verses="Matthew 5:31-32">Matthew 5:31-32</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82465" data-verses="Matthew 19:3-9">19:3-9</span>.

<p data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp_n_lbjQrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen"> The principle in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82466" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:10">7:10</span> is the same as that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82467" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>, where Paul says, “It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” In both verses we see the principle of incarnation; two persons living as one person. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82468" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:10">7:10</span> we have two persons, the Lord and Paul, speaking as one. This is the reason Paul says, “I charge, not I but the Lord.” Why does Paul not say in this verse, “But to the married the Lord charges”? Why does he say that he charges, yet not he but the Lord? The answer to these questions is that Paul realized that he was one with the Lord and that what he spoke was the Lord’s word. Even when he did not claim to have a word from the Lord, because he was one with the Lord, whatever he said was the Lord’s word. </p>

For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82469" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:12">verse 12</span> he says, “But to the rest I say, not the Lord, If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to dwell with him, let him not leave her.” This word also is based on the New Testament principle of incarnation. Although Paul is careful to add, “not the Lord,” whatever he says in the following verses is part of the divine revelation in the New Testament. It is his opinion in the Lord, not the Lord’s commandment, yet it still expresses the Lord’s mind. </p>
<p data-content-id="k_DHJPbquZertxEnBc6g-ljfw4I_Y_ACjj1dCOx2ooYdTIhcWKx_8CTD37vjRHlBO"> Can you sense Paul’s spirit in these verses? Here Paul seems to be saying, “Even though I realize that this is my word, not the Lord’s word, I still believe that this is pleasing to the Lord. The Lord is pleased by keeping the peace. Even though the Lord does not say such a word, I have the assurance that it pleases Him. Therefore, I say that a brother should not leave an unbelieving wife if she consents to dwell with him. Likewise, a sister should not leave an unbelieving husband if he consents to dwell with her. However, if an unbelieving husband desires to leave a sister or if an <span class="pg" data-page-id="381" id="381">[381]</span> unbelieving wife should leave a brother, neither the sister nor the brother should fight. Rather, each should let the other party go, for God has called us in peace. I am the one who is saying this, not the Lord. Yet I believe that such a saying is pleasing to the Lord.” </p>
<p data-content-id="JIZ-QykqNDG1BWmM2KnMOMhZju_iNYeGWjotftPoJZcGOh57N2xS8o8hJ8R-wu70-"> Here we see a person who is one with the Lord. Because he is one with Him, he knows the Lord’s heart, mind, and pleasure. For this reason, he has the boldness to utter something which the Lord has not spoken. </p>

<p data-content-id="sekrxE0ekH4YzjuJnZ6t8c3cdplKbmWoe4StaMMSkFLy5jYO71G6nuPBp_WYYIECE"> We have seen that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82490" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:12-20">6:12-20</span> may be considered an introduction to Paul’s dealing with married life and to his dealing with the eating of sacrifices to idols. Both marriage and eating have been ordained by God. Therefore, concerning marriage and eating we have our freedom. However, we must use these things in God’s way and for God’s purpose, not for our lusts. Furthermore, marriage and eating are related to our physical bodies. Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82491" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:13">6:13</span> that the body is for the Lord; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82492" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:15">6:15</span>, that our bodies are members of Christ; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82493" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:19">6:19</span>, that our bodies are a temple of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="wIQrvVteeI1oKV87cJZVVv5dOgX231XUrpFU0B3r25XvLEhXjHSjbC3_2HzXXD3x4"> As human beings, we are a complete entity composed of spirit, soul, and body. In order for our body to be the temple of the Holy Spirit our entire being—spirit, soul, and body—must be involved. Since we are a whole entity, none of the parts of our being should be separated from the others. On the one hand, it is our bodies that are members of Christ and the temple of the Holy Spirit. On the other hand, our spirit is also involved. For this reason, in the passage where he emphasizes that the body is a member of Christ and the temple of the Holy Spirit, Paul tells us that we are one spirit with the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82494" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">6:17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="LCOBHh-_8rtpkoOSBhuJ3SLJouiGtADmWdbcP07K7WCcffclCOEo5EYkos9Kc9G0W"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82495" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:1">chapter seven</span> Paul comes to the matter of marriage. Married life surely involves our whole being. According to what Paul says in this chapter, we need to be those who are for the Lord, one with Him, submissive to Him, committed to Him, and content in Him with our circumstances. We need <span class="pg" data-page-id="386" id="386">[386]</span> to take our circumstances from the Lord and be with Him in every kind of situation. This requires that we exercise our spirit to practice being one spirit with the Lord. This is also to have a life where our bodies are the members of Christ and the temple of the Holy Spirit. If we touch the depths of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82496" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:1">chapter seven</span>, we shall see that the answers to the questions about marriage consummate in the description of a person who is one with the Lord and who lives in such a way that his entire being is the Lord’s dwelling place. Because his body is a member of Christ and the temple of the Holy Spirit, he will not use it for any purpose other than that ordained by God. Furthermore, he will be submissive to the Lord and to His leading, always remaining in the circumstances arranged by the Lord without initiating any change. He is thus a person who is one with the Lord for His purpose. </p>

We can live without being married, but not without eating. Eating is an absolute necessity. God created us in such a way that we must eat in order to stay alive. This is God’s ordination. </p>
<p data-content-id="EKLQNzB20IJMJNZAsXkVbasdhWNIKYBtSlX0sKgDmdSh2KIOAd4oaYB8TBbVW9IBJ"> As we proceed from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82498" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">chapter one</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82499" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:1">chapter eight</span>, we find that Paul’s dealings become more and more practical. The eating mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82500" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:1">chapter eight</span> is much more practical than the philosophy referred to in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82501" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">chapter one</span>.

<p data-content-id="DeXM5GXdbazrZOx-ax9Rc0jrX8cWBb4GNfXtN4JXJuzK9JlkY0coVF7VTZZGpUzMQ"> We have seen that in the first four chapters of 1 Corinthians a number of spiritual things are revealed. The principle is the same in the dealing with eating of sacrifices to idols. Three chapters are occupied with this. In these chapters there are a number of important spiritual highlights. </p>

<p data-content-id="5cvwE7fG0BCj-rNo6NGmlSxcfn8js06QHJyHjAiKtAHd3P8c8SI8FsHkl6iaraK0i"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82507" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:1">8:1</span> Paul says, “Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.” In this chapter two Greek words are used for know. One is <em>oida</em> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82508" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:1">vv. 1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82509" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:4">4</span>), signifying the inward, subjective consciousness, the intuitive knowledge, as used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82510" data-verses="John 8:55">John 8:55</span> (the second one); <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82511" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:2">1 Corinthians 12:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82512" data-verses="2Timothy 1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82513" data-verses="2Timothy 3:14-15">3:14-15</span>. It is the root from which the word for conscience is derived. The other is <em>ginosko</em> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82514" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:2-3">vv. 2-3</span>), signifying the outward, objective knowledge. The word knowledge in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82515" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:1">verse 1</span> and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82516" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:7">verses 7</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82517" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:10">10</span> is the noun form of <em>ginosko,</em> referring to the outward, objective knowledge, which is common and general to all. </p>
<p data-content-id="N9DQWvp40eBT2VybP3ap72SyWkeUtkAviDvyCRS_h8YrqVB4HFvlImtcJ6D_lT9Tg"> The outward, objective knowledge that puffs up comes from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, the source of death. The spiritual, not fleshly, love, which is an expression of life as described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82518" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>, builds up. It comes from the tree of life, the source of life. This is the love of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82519" data-verses="1John 4:16">1 John 4:16</span>) infused into us by faith which has brought us into the organic union with God. By this love we love God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82520" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:3">1 Cor. 8:3</span>) and the brothers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82521" data-verses="1John 4:21">1 John 4:21</span>), and according to this love we should walk (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82522" data-verses="Romans 14:15">Rom. 14:15</span>). Thus, our walk builds up (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82523" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:23">1 Cor. 10:23</span>). The expression “builds up” in this verse refers not only to the edification of individual believers, but also to the building up of the corporate Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82524" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:4-5">14:4-5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82525" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:12">12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82526" data-verses="Ephesians 4:16">Eph. 4:16</span>). This book stresses the matter of building up (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82527" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9-10">3:9-10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82528" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:12">12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82529" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:23">10:23</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="tiNQgxDpsd4NWazI4KY7Ls3Zc1jf31TN7mm0onJv7jbyJhqTUCAeHZ8B89sG6uKJy"> We have pointed out that the knowledge which puffs up and the love which builds up are related to the two trees in the garden of Eden. Knowledge here refers to the tree of knowledge, and love refers to the tree of life. When Paul wrote this Epistle, he probably had such an understanding of these two trees. Furthermore, in this book these two trees are illustrated, although there is no direct mention of them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="388" id="388">[388]</span> Actually 1 Corinthians deals with the tree of life which supplies life and the tree of knowledge which kills. Thus, in this book there are two lines, the line of life and the line of knowledge. Knowledge puffs up and even kills, but love supplies life and builds up others with life. Life is for the building, and the building is accomplished by life. </p>
<p data-content-id="h8T7ZUYpMcEVtTeTw4Ei-WaWWau_ZtkWH0Z7SjFWsI31mZB3IXYJad2ffrJvNMmVr"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82530" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:2-3">Verses 2 and 3</span> say, “If anyone thinks that he knows anything, he does not yet know as he ought to know; but if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.” In these verses the Greek word for know is <em>ginosko.</em> The love spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82531" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:3">verse 3</span> is the highest and noblest love. It must be spiritual, not fleshly, although it involves the exercise of man’s entire being (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82532" data-verses="Mark 12:30">Mark 12:30</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="UF3NSi3eZh7Dl_ZC3t8J3SGQLMJgBmML7ww7n62jfdnUmnLxDxMDWGNZfNU2kahGc"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82533" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:3">verse 3</span> Paul seems to be telling the Corinthians that they do not need so much knowledge; instead, they need to love God. Loving God is the base of our Christian life. If we do not have such a love, we do not have the standing, the base, for the Christian life. As far as the Christian life is concerned, knowledge is like a vapor; it can disappear quickly. Loving God, however, is solid and substantial. Hence, it is the base of the Christian life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mdwix_GaOy3SQn0ueCAHqoNdP1UMTDSJLyKRUvBvWkxI-OJG9yVXJjndZOAKNjsqN"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82534" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:3">verse 3</span> Paul says that if we love God, we are known by Him. It is more necessary for us to be known by God than for us to know God. The expression “known by Him” is very meaningful. To be known by God means to be owned and possessed by Him. The one who is known by God becomes God’s possession, joy, entertainment, and pleasure. Our knowledge does not please God. But if we love God, we shall make Him happy. He will know us, enjoy us, and be happy with us. He will even find in us His entertainment. All this is implied by the words “known by Him.” </p>

<p data-content-id="prVBOIVQEyCQk7WbC65wKBFpZIyHUt92qI6Jlya3N6sMf93hlzv0FeRHAEKBhJS-J"> The philosophical Greek believers at Corinth made everything complicated. In answering their questions, Paul simplified matters. He encouraged the Corinthians to take the Lord, His ordination, and His sovereign arrangement. Paul also realized that if we live Christ by being one spirit with the Lord and if we are submissive to the Lord and committed to Him, many complicated situations will be simplified. Complications in human life come from the philosophizing mind. For example, philosophizing about marriage can produce complications in married life. In today’s society there are many complications regarding marriage. In the church life in the Lord’s recovery, we need to follow the New Testament principles to simplify situations and eliminate complications. When we analyze our married life and family life, we become complicated. But when we turn to the spirit, everything is simplified. </p>
<p data-content-id="vFgafReeId0NLp6vSzTQo14EsX_DOCFdzRvaL7ogGNBc9CrkwduxPEplaAWErKNdi"> I appreciate <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82560" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:1">1 Corinthians 7</span> because this chapter shows us a person, Paul, who was saturated with God, one with Him, and fully submissive to Him. There was no argument between Paul and God, and no discrepancy between him and God. He was happy with whatever circumstances God arranged for him. We know this not because he says so explicitly; we know it by the instructions he gives the Corinthians concerning married life. These instructions reveal the kind of person Paul was. Paul’s writing in this chapter shows that he was a genuine God-man. </p>

This problem seems to have a yes or no answer. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82562" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:1">chapter eight</span> Paul does not answer yes or no. The way he deals with this question shows that he is not a person who lives according to the tree of knowledge of good and evil, but one who lives according to the tree of life. With the tree of life it is not a matter of yes or no; it is solely a matter of life, God’s life, the divine, eternal life expressed through love which builds up. This life always commends us to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="2x5QcsCAgui9NXQYMVnCg51gf1NTLk96CwwmUh3an8nZifIVz9C609J7eMcjMZTbI"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82563" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:8">8:8</span> Paul introduces the thought of being commended to God. This is an excellent expression, even an extraordinary one. I doubt that such an expression can be found elsewhere in the Bible. Paul’s answer in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82564" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:1">chapter eight</span> certainly is not a matter of yes or no. On the contrary, it is related to doing things which commend us to God. According to Paul’s realization, if a certain thing does not commend us to God, there is no need for us to engage in it. </p>
<p data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp_mflbhQrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen"> Paul was so one with God and saturated with Him that his entire being was in God. Therefore, he answers the questions raised by the Corinthians not with a yes or a no, but according to what he is and according to his own practice. His practice was to have a life that was absolutely one with God. We all need to see this vision and practice it, even as Paul did. </p>

Eventually, he concludes this chapter by saying, “Wherefore if food stumbles my brother, I will by no means eat meat forever, that I may not stumble my brother” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82570" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:13">v. 13</span>). The expression “my brother” indicates that every brother was dear to Paul. He loved all the brothers. Paul was one with God and one with the Body of Christ. For this reason, he did not answer questions according to yes or no, according to the tree of knowledge. If everyone in a local church had a life and practice to match that of Paul, there would be no questions, problems, or complications. Questions come from the <span class="pg" data-page-id="397" id="397">[397]</span> philosophizing mind. But when we turn to the Christ who dwells in our spirit, the situation becomes simple. </p>

As all believers in Christ should be, he is also free from the bondage of any particular way of eating, although he practices the principle of considerate love. </p>
<p data-content-id="anLB0qPKqLGVpnELJCF3jkmpBzp5jxv0qtin83xcw1YQmFAHifmPHXLBQ92ZO24yM"> As he presents himself a pattern to the believers, Paul comes to his apostleship, which gives him authority to deal with all the problems covered in this book, serious problems concerning the church life and its fellowship. His handling of them is based not only on his teaching, but also on the authority inherent in his apostleship. To deal with the situation, Paul must take this standing and make this matter clear to the Corinthian believers. They had questioned his apostleship and were in a chaotic situation, mostly due to the foolishness of their worldly wisdom, self-confidence, and pride. </p>
<p data-content-id="b6PkOnBRxPH-JZwYqEGn8CHT8qNMfaW8GcFW5oQUwlEPRETelPUlRIL-iaR1qLEZU"> Apostle is an anglicized Greek word which means one who is sent. An apostle of the Lord is a believer who is sent out by Him with His authority to preach the gospel of God, to teach the divine truth, and to establish churches. Peter and John were such apostles among the Jews in the first section of the book of Acts, and Paul and Barnabas were such apostles among the Gentiles in the second section of Acts. Others, such as Silas and Timothy, also became apostles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82575" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1 Thes. 1:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82576" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:6">2:6</span>). As long as anyone has the power to preach the gospel, the gift to teach the divine truth, and the ability to establish churches, he is qualified and confirmed <span class="pg" data-page-id="398" id="398">[398]</span> to be an apostle sent by the Lord with His commission and authority. </p>

This is a special privilege; it constitutes some dignity and glory to the seer, but it is not a requirement or qualification for being an apostle of the Lord. This is proved by the case of Barnabas, who was one of the apostles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82579" data-verses="Acts 14:14">Acts 14:14</span>), yet did not see the Lord in this way. However, to know the Lord in spirit by spiritual revelation is definitely needed for being an apostle. </p>

The fruit of his labor is evidence of his apostleship. The sufficient result of the apostle’s efficient work is not only an evidence, a proof, but also a seal of his apostleship.

The fact that he speaks about his apostleship indicates that the Corinthian believers also had a problem regarding Paul’s apostleship. Some of them may have doubted whether Paul was truly an apostle. They may have discussed this matter and questioned Paul’s apostleship. Paul must have learned of their doubts. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82584" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:1">chapter nine</span> he speaks about it in a way that is strong, direct, and frank. The four questions he asks in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82585" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:1">verse 1</span> illustrate Paul’s frankness. Paul’s spirit here is very clean.

Paul’s questions in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82586" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:1">verse 1</span> certainly are not polite. Would you write a letter in which you asked such questions? Here Paul was <span class="pg" data-page-id="399" id="399">[399]</span> not polite or political, but he was pure, genuine, and honest.

<p data-content-id="JIZ-QykqNDG1BWmM2KnMOMhZju_iNYeGWi4tb_PoJZcGOh57N2xS8o8hJ8R-wu70-"> We have pointed out that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82612" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:1-15">9:1-15</span> reveals how pure Paul was. When we use the word pure here, we use it in a biblical sense. For example, the Lord Jesus said, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82613" data-verses="Matthew 5:8">Matt. 5:8</span>). In this verse to be pure means to be single in motive in seeking after God. If our motive is single, we are pure. Otherwise, we are impure. When we say that Paul was pure and that the Corinthians were impure, we mean that Paul had a single motive in seeking after God, but that the Corinthians had mixed motives. Because they were not pure, they even doubted Paul’s apostleship and wanted to examine him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82614" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:16">Second Corinthians 12:16</span> indicates that some of the believers at Corinth thought that Paul was gaining material profit from them through craft. They could think this way about Paul because their motives were not pure. </p>
<p data-content-id="zjs7tyZL5uIfKl2-jisuY3zjK1KLXAhZHT-hZV4aRDYk9Z7bsjPuLM57LGu0lUUp1"> Whether or not we are pure depends on our motive. Our motive may be related to our personal benefit, to something which would be a profit to us. The problems in the churches are often related to the seeking of some kind of personal gain. If a particular aspect of the church life is a benefit to you, you may be happy and very much for the church. However, if there is no personal gain for you in the church, you may be unhappy and find fault with the church. When we fail to receive what we expect, we may be unhappy with the church, the elders, or the saints. This indicates that we are not pure, that our motive is for our personal benefit. </p>
<p data-content-id="anLB0qPKqLGVpnELJCF3jkmpBzp5jxv0qtSn1kxcw1YQmFAHifmPHXLBQ92ZO24yM"> We all love the Lord and the recovery. We may even stand <span class="pg" data-page-id="406" id="406">[406]</span> up in a meeting and declare that we consecrate ourselves to Christ and the church. We may say that Christ is marvelous and that the church is wonderful. But if our motives are not pure, we may begin to have problems with the church after making such a declaration and consecration. Regarding our motives, we need to be crucified with Christ. We need the cross to touch our motives. </p>
<p data-content-id="b6PkOnBRxPH-JZwYqEGn8CHT8qNMfaW8Gc1Wx7AUwlEPRETelPUlRIL-iaR1qLEZU"> Paul was pure because he knew experientially what it was to be crucified with Christ and to be one spirit with the Lord. He lived a crucified life, and he practiced being one spirit with the Lord. Therefore, he did not have any motive related to personal gain. His motive was wholly in Christ and for Christ. This was the reason Paul could be so pure. Because he was so pure, he could speak in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82615" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:1-15">9:1-15</span> in a bold, frank, strong, and direct manner. Like a surgeon who has been cleansed of all bacteria, he could operate on the Corinthians. If Paul had not been pure, his impurity would have been imparted to the Corinthians. But because he was pure, he could perform spiritual surgery on the believers at Corinth without contaminating them. </p>

<p data-content-id="Mdwix_GaOy3SQn0ueCAHqoNdP1UMTDSJLyqRXvhvWkxI-OJG9yVXJjndZOAKNjsqN"> Having seen Paul’s purity in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82616" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:1-15">9:1-15</span>, let us go on in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82617" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:16-23">9:16-23</span> to see his faithfulness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82618" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:16">verse 16</span> Paul says, “For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.” By necessity Paul means a burden which becomes a pressure. Such a necessity, such a pressing burden, to preach the gospel was laid upon him. Thus, he could say, “Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.” Paul did not care how the Corinthians treated him or how they reacted to him. He had a burden which pressed upon him to carry out the work of his ministry. His ministry to preach the gospel was a necessity. Paul knew that if he did not preach, he would suffer loss. This indicates Paul’s faithfulness. </p>
<p data-content-id="VAmSFImgVrwWBDh3eU1j3ZFZPnAW6HkY9IeA_aJXxzEgwGujPfsebgBAiBEiWFZI6"> Like love, faithfulness can make us blind. If we are keen to know the attitude and reaction of others toward us, we <span class="pg" data-page-id="407" id="407">[407]</span> may not be faithful. It is not faithful to preach the gospel only if others give us a favorable reaction. If we are faithful in preaching the gospel, we shall not care for the way others react or for the way they treat us, because we have a burden, a necessity, to fulfill our ministry. This faithfulness blinds the faithful one to the reaction of others. </p>

The words “not of my own will” mean not willingly. Even if Paul had not been willing to preach the gospel, he would have had no way to escape the Lord’s burden, for he had been entrusted with a stewardship. This indicates that with Paul preaching the gospel was not a matter of choice. Paul had been caught by the Lord, drafted by Him, and entrusted with a stewardship. Whether or not he was willing, he had to fulfill the burden given to him. He had no choice about this. He could not escape the commission to preach the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="9eaN6Fdd37GIAwbbB4iu5JzKVZeyCcOvdvBTi4ngEMpuLpI4URJ1klC1LrBzVosWL"> In this verse Paul refers both to God’s commission and to his own burden. Because God had commissioned him, he had a burden. He had no choice except to carry on the work of the ministry. Therefore, he could say to the Corinthians, “I don’t care how you treat me, or how you doubt about me or examine me. I preached the gospel to you out of burden, out of necessity. I did not have any choice in the matter.” </p>

Having a Reward</h2><p data-content-id="TgPV7WYzePxLg1dlN-g0NWu5ni7DunVUw2j8prU42YLj5QKtSQNXUKE8xxgPy_6YT"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82620" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:17">verse 17</span> Paul speaks of a reward. The book of 1 Corinthians was not written to help lost sinners be saved, but to help saved believers to grow (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82621" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:6-7">3:6-7</span>), to build with the precious materials (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82622" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:10">3:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82623" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:12-14">12-14</span>), to care for the Lord’s members (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82624" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:9-13">8:9-13</span>), and to run the race (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82625" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:24">9:24</span>). Hence, reward is mentioned repeatedly as an incentive to the believers’ progress (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82626" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:14">3:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82627" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:18">9:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82628" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:24-25">24-25</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="nHflLWyF2nFg6U3Z-4mUTN0kfws3Baz2FQpbi3FTEzR-CESxOjvQhJ575ytY-yo5S"> The Greek word rendered stewardship also means a <span class="pg" data-page-id="408" id="408">[408]</span> household administration, household dispensation. The apostle was not only a preacher but also a steward in God’s house, a household administrator, dispensing Christ’s salvation, life, and riches to His believers. Such a ministry is the stewardship with which he was entrusted and commissioned (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82629" data-verses="Ephesians 3:2">Eph. 3:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82630" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">2 Cor. 4:1</span>). </p>

That in preaching the gospel I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel.” Here we see that Paul did not use his right with respect to the Corinthians. This gave him ground to boast, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82632" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:16">verse 16</span>. Although Paul did not use his right with the Corinthians, he did use it with other churches. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82633" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:8">2 Corinthians 11:8</span> Paul even says that he robbed other churches in order to serve the Corinthians. Other churches supplied him, but the church at Corinth did not. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82634" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:18">1 Corinthians 9:18</span>, Paul preached the gospel to the Corinthians free of charge. </p>

He was free from all men in the sense that he did not owe anyone anything. This means that he was free from the Corinthians, not owing them anything. However, being free from all, Paul enslaved himself to all in order to gain more people for the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="wIQrvVteeI1oKV87cJZVVv5dOgX231XUrplUxTnr25XvLEhXjHSjbC3_2HzXXD3x4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82636" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:20-21">verses 20 and 21</span> Paul says, “And to the Jews I became as a Jew, in order that I might gain Jews; to those under law, as under law (not being myself under law), that I might gain those under law; to those without law, as without law (not being without the law of God but within the law of Christ), that I might gain those without law.” Here it seems as if Paul was not a Jew. Actually, he was a Jew, but he no longer lived a Jewish life. Instead, he lived a Christian life. But he became as a Jew in order to gain Jews. Likewise, to those under law, he became as one under law in order to gain those under law. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82637" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:20">verse 20</span> Paul inserts the parenthetical <span class="pg" data-page-id="409" id="409">[409]</span> statement “not being myself under law” in order to indicate that he was not under law. He did not want the Corinthians to think that he was for the law. Although he was not under law, he became as one under law to those who were under the law. </p>

Paul wrote this Epistle not only according to the situation at Corinth, but also with the history of the children of Israel as the background. Israel is a complete type of the history of the church. The Bible contains two histories—the history of Israel and the history of the church. The history of the children of Israel is a type, and the history of the church is the fulfillment of the type. Thus, the entire Bible gives us one revelation, the revelation of God’s economy. In the Old Testament we have a type, a picture, of God’s economy, whereas in the New Testament God’s economy is fulfilled. </p>

The fact that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82677" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:1-13">10:1-13</span> is a continuation of this insertion is proved by the word “for” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82678" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:1">10:1</span>. This word indicates that what follows is a continuation and an explanation of what has gone before. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82679" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:1">Chapter ten</span> is not only a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82680" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:1">chapter nine</span>, but also a further definition of the race in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82681" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:24-27">9:24-27</span>, with the children of Israel in the wilderness used as an illustration.

The running of the Christian course ordained by God is typified by the history of the children of Israel. The Israelites ran the course from Egypt, through the wilderness, and into the good land.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82685" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:1">chapter nine</span> Paul seems to be saying, “Brothers, you should imitate me and take me as a pattern.

The cloud signifies the Spirit; this is related to life. The sea signifies the water of death. Hence, baptism is a matter of both life and death.

In Hebrews and 1 Corinthians he points out clearly that what happened to the children of Israel is a type of us. The entire history of Israel is a story of the church. As we have seen, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82768" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:6">10:6</span> Paul, referring to the children of Israel, says, “Now these things occurred as types of us.” </p>

The Hebrew believers were infants in doctrines concerning Christ, and they were frustrated from entering into the full rest of the promised land because of their shortage of faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82769" data-verses="Hebrews 5:11-14">Heb. 5:11-14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82770" data-verses="Hebrews 3:6-19">3:6-19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82771" data-verses="Hebrews 6:1">6:1</span>). Thus, they needed the growth in faith. They were short of adequate faith in the proper knowledge of the truth. Paul refers to this deeper truth as the word of righteousness, as solid food (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82772" data-verses="Hebrews 5:12-14">Heb. 5:12-14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="YAf-ThL_BpKj4Bal8Hh8S_ZBAgDwrplD4dOUKWc4sdE5fnGiiRPa9o6wxsU4R57wn"> The Corinthian believers were infants in the experience of Christ and were frustrated from entering into the full enjoyment of Christ because they were soulish and fleshly. Thus, they needed the growth in life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82773" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1-3">1 Cor. 3:1-3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82774" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:6-7">6-7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82775" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:14">2:14</span>).

The one group, the Hebrew believers, needed to progress, to increase, in the proper faith in the deeper truths; the second group, the Corinthian believers, needed to progress in the growth in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="TgPV7WYzePxLg1dlN-g0NWu5ni7DunVUw1D8ppU42YLj5QKtSQNXUKE8xxgPy_6YT"> The Corinthian believers had Christ as their portion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82776" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1:2</span>), for they had been called into the fellowship of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82777" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">1:9</span>). God had made Christ to them power and wisdom: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82778" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1:30</span>). Furthermore, the Corinthian believers had experienced and enjoyed Christ as their Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82779" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:7">5:7</span>), their holiness for sanctification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82780" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:11">6:11</span>), their righteousness for justification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82781" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:11">6:11</span>), the unleavened bread for their Christian life as a feast (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82782" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:8">5:8</span>), their spiritual food (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82783" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:3">10:3</span>), their spiritual drink (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82784" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:4">10:4a</span>), and their spiritual rock (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82785" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:4">10:4b</span>). Their experiences of Christ were all by their regenerated spirit mingled with the Spirit, who is the resurrected Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82786" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:14">2:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82787" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">6:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82788" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">15:45b</span>). In the future, they will enjoy Christ as their glory for glorification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82789" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:7-8">2:7-8</span>). That will be the redemption of their body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82790" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1:30</span>). They were in the participation in Christ’s blood and Christ’s body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82791" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:16">10:16</span>). Nevertheless, they were admonished not to fall in the Christian race, as most of the children of Israel did in the wilderness, but rather to grow into the full possession and enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ, God’s promised land. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nHflLWyF2nFg6U3Z-4mUTN0kfws3Baz2FTJbi1FTEzR-CESxOjvQhJ575ytY-yo5S">THE HISTORY OF ISRAEL</h2><p data-content-id="6nl9vMoAoMK12zKD0K5y_Gx6eSA-VnhwzWAnCK_a_w2PSkAV7X6WzBuN8UC31SJbX"> The history of Israel can be divided into three sections. We may call the first of these sections the section of salvation. According to the book of Exodus, the children of Israel, although they were God’s chosen people, were in a fallen condition and were under the tyranny of the Egyptians. But they were saved out of that fallen situation and brought to the mountain of God and to the dwelling place of God. They also received the divine provisions to supply their need. When they needed food, the heavenly manna came. When they needed drink, the living water flowed to them out of the cleft rock. All their needs were met by God. Thus, they <span class="pg" data-page-id="429" id="429">[429]</span> had the divine provisions which enabled them to enter into the good land. After coming into the land, they enjoyed the riches of the land. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82792" data-verses="Deuteronomy 8:7-9">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</span> we have an excellent view of the riches of the good land. Every aspect of these riches typifies an aspect of the riches of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="RKpt0z8nFNlHi_3vAHu8OcgGgYOj-shs8EOS2vbEU8dkYiKR-u6Z0ZA1R2xXn3ai4"> In the previous message we gave a word of warning. In that message not much encouragement was given. Now in this message we shall consider something very encouraging. Actually the history, or the type, of Israel is not disappointing. Yes, it is true that only two who came out of Egypt entered into the good land. Of the more than two million who came out of Egypt only Joshua and Caleb, along with the body of Joseph, entered into the good land. However, along with them, all those of the new generation came into the good land. On the human side we see failure, but from God’s side we see victory. We must take note of the fact that eventually God’s chosen people entered into the good land; conquered, subdued, and drove out the usurpers; gained the land; and enjoyed all the riches in the land. They established the kingdom, and within the kingdom a temple was built. Therefore, among His people in the good land with the kingdom and the temple, God had His expression. This marks the end of the section of the history of Israel called the section of salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="sekrxE0ekH4YzjuJnZ6t8c3cdplKbmWoe7StdfsSkFLy5jYO71G6nuPBp_WYYIECE"> In the Bible God’s full and complete salvation includes the Passover, the exodus, the crossing of the Red Sea, the journey in the wilderness, the supply of the divine provisions, fellowship with God at His mountain, receiving divine revelation, and the building up of God’s dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="wIQrvVteeI1oKV87cJZVVv5dOgX231XUrqFUySHr25XvLEhXjHSjbC3_2HzXXD3x4"> As we consider the scope of this full and complete salvation, we must realize that God can never be defeated. We may think that it is impossible for God to gain one hundred forty-four thousand overcomers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82793" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Rev. 14:1</span>). To us this may seem impossible. But what is impossible with man is altogether possible with God. Our God is a victorious God. He cannot be defeated, and His purpose, His plan, cannot be defeated either. God is great, and His view is vast. He had a <span class="pg" data-page-id="430" id="430">[430]</span> way to bring His people out of Egypt, through the wilderness, and into the good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="LCOBHh-_8rtpkoOSBhuJ3SLJouiGtADmWebcGn7K7WCcffclCOEo5EYkos9Kc9G0W"> Were the children of Israel defeated, or did they gain the victory? The correct answer to this question is that they were defeated temporarily, but ultimately they were victorious. They gained the good land and received God’s full salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="mA_96h-ZPzHjy0DOYoWw3UVdng1dAcNQNaK0jfM6FnoHymfKQciucRWHW48k6Jjdb"> It is common for Christians, under the influence of traditional theology, to ask others if they have been saved. To give a proper answer to this question, we need to consider the scope of God’s complete salvation and to realize that it includes the entire experience of the children of Israel from the Passover to the building of the temple in the good land. The enjoyment of the Passover certainly was an aspect of God’s salvation. However, it was simply the beginning of full salvation; it was not the completion of this salvation. Only after the children of Israel had crossed the Red Sea, journeyed through the wilderness, gained possession of the good land, and built the temple, which was filled with the glory of God, did they have the completion of God’s full salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zjyvva9_mwbWU7v14CMragfkXMl76M85HKoYr1C2npxvRcj28K_niY4FY2FqTLVIx"> The next time someone asks you if you have been saved, you should answer in a wise way. You need to inquire what is meant by God’s salvation and what this salvation includes. You may reply, “You ask me if I have been saved. Before I answer, I would like you to tell me what is the span, the scope, of God’s salvation.” Yes, the children of Israel experienced salvation at the time of the Passover. A member of the tribe of Benjamin, for example, could have testified confidently that because he had enjoyed the Passover, he had been saved. God’s salvation, however, includes much more than the Passover. As we have pointed out, it includes God’s habitation, His dwelling place. Not only is salvation for God’s habitation; it even includes this habitation. If we have not yet experienced God’s dwelling place, our salvation is not complete. To be saved in a full and complete way means to enjoy the Passover, to experience the exodus and the crossing of the Red Sea, to be supplied with the divine provisions, to gain possession of the good land, and to be built up as a <span class="pg" data-page-id="431" id="431">[431]</span> temple of God, His habitation on earth. God’s glory will then fill this temple. This is full salvation. The entire history of the children of Israel from the Passover to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82794" data-verses="1Kings 8:1">1 Kings 8</span> is a type of the church. However, many Christian teachers take only particular aspects as types, not the complete history. </p>

<p data-content-id="UF3NSi3eZh7Dl_ZC3t8J3SGQLMJgBmML7zg7vqGjfdnUmnLxDxMDWGNZfNU2kahGc"> In his understanding of the holy Word, Paul is able to see through the physical things and through the black and white letters and to see Christ. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82805" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:4">10:4</span> he speaks of a physical rock as Christ. This indicates that in this rock he sees Christ. In the same principle, by the word idolatry Paul does not merely mean graven images, but something much broader and more inclusive. As we shall see, idolatry here implies a great deal. </p>
<p data-content-id="rOrhtHgFLbPZdw3O4ue4E_N7etWmKRSVj4tw8A0d5A7IYnxmV72X7JLePRUU6vTBF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82806" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:15">verse 15</span> Paul continues, “I speak as to prudent men; you judge what I say.” Paul expected that the readers would not stop at the black and white letters, but dig into what he says and then investigate, discern, and judge it.

The bread which we break, is it not a fellowship of the body of Christ?” Apparently there is no flow of proper continuation between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82808" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:15-16">verses 15 and 16</span>. Without any transition, Paul begins to speak of the cup of blessing, indicating that it is a fellowship of the blood of Christ. He also speaks concerning the bread, indicating that it is a fellowship of the body of Christ. We should not take this verse for granted, assuming that we understand it when we actually understand very little, if anything. We need to investigate the meaning of the expressions “a fellowship of the blood of Christ” and “a fellowship of the body of Christ.” </p>
<p data-content-id="K9Fhzhq9ETFPCPzdkFWRrkfkDyu0qmgIvzy5sjP0zVrET7fYv2qxzXlZDmd0Kk9SX"> The Greek word rendered fellowship also means joint participation. Fellowship here refers to the believer’s communion in the joint participation in the blood and body of Christ. This makes us, the participants of the Lord’s blood and body, not only one with one another, but also one with the Lord. We, the participants, make ourselves identified with the Lord in the fellowship of His blood and body. The apostle’s thought here is to illustrate how eating and drinking make the eaters and drinkers one with what they eat and drink. The Corinthians should realize that their abusive eating of idol sacrifices actually makes them one with the demons behind the sacrifices. </p>

On the contrary, the second portion of this chapter is a continuation of the first portion; it is not separate from it. </p>
<p data-content-id="GBDJJALJ0cF4ks8AH19ucJjnWsP4LTnCHC4KC4XhfQlZ2XYUYk_NIq7g1JKhMOSI_"> The Greek word translated fellowshippers also means joint participants. Those who eat the sacrifices of the altar are not only fellowshippers with one another and with the altar, but also joint participants of what they eat. Their participation in what they eat makes them one with the sacrifices of the altar. Since the altar is the base of the sacrifices offered to God, eating the sacrifices of the altar makes the eaters its fellowshippers, its joint participants. This also illustrates the fact that eating makes the eater one with what he eats. Eating sacrifices to idols does the same: it identifies the eaters with the demons behind the sacrifices. </p>
<p data-content-id="c72SBDvLnZO0HTNpK_Y1vJj4uYnRW9aV2K2G4tOhmUkJUykeLnr0FNqIv6PWDSSzw"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82815" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:18">verse 18</span> Paul surely means that the fellowship of the altar is a type of the fellowship of the blood and body of Christ. To put it simply, it is a type of the fellowship of the Lord’s table. Hence, the fellowshippers of the altar are types of the fellowshippers of the Lord’s table. Israel had an altar, but we have a table. On the altar there were the offerings; on the table there are the blood and the body. The one is the type, and the other is the fulfillment. Whereas the children of Israel were fellowshipping around the altar, we are fellowshipping around the table. </p>

But that the things which the Gentiles <span class="pg" data-page-id="440" id="440">[440]</span> sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become fellowshippers of demons.” Here Paul’s composition takes another leap, apparently without any transition. </p>
<p data-content-id="DeXM5GXdbazrZOx-ax9Rc0jrX8cWBb4GNcHtO4pXJuzK9JlkY0coVF7VTZZGpUzMQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82817" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:19-20">verses 19 and 20</span> Paul speaks of idols, sacrifices to idols, and demons. An idol and a sacrifice to an idol are nothing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82818" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:4">8:4</span>). But behind them are the demons, who are abominable and hateful to God. The believers who worship God should abstain from identifying themselves with demons and becoming fellowshippers of demons through eating sacrifices to idols. Since demons are the reality of idols, so the eating of sacrifices to idols makes the eaters their fellowshippers, their joint participants. The eaters of sacrifices to idols become not only fellowshippers with demons, but also joint participants of demons, making themselves one with demons. </p>

Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82822" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:21">verse 21</span> he goes on to say, “You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.” Here we see that there are two tables: the table of the Lord and the table of demons. To partake of a table is to eat of it. To drink the cup of the Lord and partake of the table of the Lord is to identify ourselves with the Lord. To drink the cup of demons and partake of the table of demons is to make ourselves one with demons. </p>

Are we stronger than He?” The Lord is the jealous God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82825" data-verses="Exodus 20:5">Exo. 20:5</span>). Idolatry is utterly abominable to God and hated by Him. If we participate in fellowship with demons, making ourselves one with them, we shall provoke the Lord to jealousy. Hence, we must flee from idolatry. <span class="pg" data-page-id="441" id="441">[441]</span> </p>

Paul realized that the philosophical Greek believers had gone astray from Christ. Although they were genuine Christians, they were missing the mark concerning Christ. Instead of living a Christian life by living Christ, they were living their Greek culture. Therefore, Paul was burdened to rescue them and bring them back to Christ. </p>

On the contrary, Paul’s way of rescuing them involves matters that are deep and profound. As he wrote to the Corinthians with the aim of rescuing them from what was distracting them from Christ, Paul unveils the depths of God, the deeper things concerning Christ. If we did not have the first three chapters of 1 Corinthians, we would not know that Christ has become wisdom to us from God; neither would we know that this wisdom includes Christ as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Paul’s thought here is very deep. The problems he deals with in this Epistle may seem rather shallow, but the way he deals with these things is profound. In particular, the eating of idol sacrifices is a shallow matter. But Paul’s way of dealing with this problem is related to the deep, mysterious, all-inclusive Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="446" id="446">[446]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="RKpt0z8nFNlHi_3vAHu8OcgGgYOj-shs9GOS-9LEU8dkYiKR-u6Z0ZA1R2xXn3ai4"> The depths of God are related to the mysterious Christ. Because what we are teaching and experiencing regarding Christ is mysterious, unbelievers cannot understand what we are talking about. To them Christ is simply a historical figure. But to us Christ is real, living, present, and precious; He is mysterious, deep, and all-inclusive. He is far beyond our comprehension, so deep that we cannot fathom Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zjyvva9_mwbWU7v14CMragfkXMl76M85GIoYr3C2npxvRcj28K_niY4FY2FqTLVIx"> In his Epistles, Paul did not have a vocabulary adequate to describe the all-inclusive Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82843" data-verses="Ephesians 3:18">Ephesians 3:18</span> he speaks of apprehending with all the saints “what is the breadth and length and height and depth.” Here Paul refers to the dimensions of Christ. What is the breadth? And what are the length, the height, and the depth? These are the immeasurable dimensions of Christ. Christ Himself is the breadth, length, height, and depth. His dimensions are more vast than the dimensions of the universe. Such a marvelous Christ is beyond our apprehension. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82844" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1:2</span> we are told that Christ is “theirs and ours.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82845" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">1:9</span> Paul says that we have been called into the fellowship of Christ. This means that Christ is our portion for our enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="CFF3xQmaFvwJ5j4xk2Wr_M9AHisFFvvZBwojhulhhQwaE4qISeDhS6DHqSHn3a8XL"> For us, as those who have been called into the fellowship of Christ, it is not sufficient only to believe in Him, trust in Him, and rely on Him, as Christians today are often taught to do. Of course, we must trust in the Lord and rely on Him. But we may do this and still miss the central matter of enjoying Christ and possessing Him as our portion. In the past, many of us were taught to believe in Christ, trust in Christ, rely on Christ, and pray to Christ. One very important matter, however, was neglected—the enjoyment of Christ. Before you came into the Lord’s recovery, did you ever hear a message about enjoying Christ? Where is such a word spoken among the Lord’s people today? Christians do not have this terminology because they do not have this spiritual culture. They do not speak of eating Christ or of <span class="pg" data-page-id="447" id="447">[447]</span> drinking Him, even though these matters are mentioned in the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="PxQUR1aSfVg1g5EN0uN6GBmA7oa_DRqoDB42oLF94p-AdYjLrSH1ujpvA-dj4BNGp"> Paul’s purpose in writing 1 Corinthians was not merely to help us trust in Christ or rely on Him.

The simple phrase “theirs and ours” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82846" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1:2</span> implies enjoyment. For Christ to be ours means not only that we trust in Him, but also that we enjoy Him. How wonderful that Christ is ours to enjoy! </p>

Do you have a proper understanding of the fellowship of God’s Son? As we have pointed out, fellowship involves participation. Now I wish to say that fellowship includes enjoyment. It is correct to interpret <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82847" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">1:9</span> in this way: “By Whom you have been called into the enjoyment of His Son.” To enter into the fellowship of the Son is to come into the enjoyment of Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="vFgafReeId0NLp6vSzTQo14EsX_DOCFdyQ_aNo4gGNBc9CrkwduxPEplaAWErKNdi"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82848" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:16">10:16</span> Paul again refers to fellowship: “The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a fellowship of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a fellowship of the body of Christ?” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82849" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">1:9</span> the fellowship is the fellowship of a Person. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82850" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:16">10:16</span> the fellowship is of that Person’s blood and body. When the Lord Jesus ate with His disciples and established the table, He “took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is My body” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82851" data-verses="Matthew 26:26">Matt. 26:26</span>). Then taking the cup and giving thanks, “He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82852" data-verses="Matthew 26:27">v. 27</span>). Today the Lord invites us to His table and says of the bread and the cup, “This is My body; take and eat.... This is My blood; take and drink.” However, we may take these matters for granted, not realizing that by speaking in this way concerning His body and blood, the Lord is presenting Himself to us for our enjoyment. He gives Himself to us as our food supply so that we may enjoy Him. Oh, may the Lord open our eyes! He, the all-inclusive One, has given His body for us to eat and His blood for us to drink. He has given <span class="pg" data-page-id="448" id="448">[448]</span> us Himself so that we may partake of Him and enjoy Him by eating and drinking Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="WPLFJeiDr66zP26-znBSbuxrk_rGZbWaygiyw_QagmclIUlGYx9j371es8KAwySLd"> As the all-inclusive One who presents Himself to us for our enjoyment, Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. He is the very God incarnate, the One who lived on earth as a man for thirty-three and a half years, who died on the cross to terminate the old creation, who was resurrected physically and spiritually, and who became through resurrection the life-giving Spirit. Today the One who presents His body and blood to us is Christ as the life-giving Spirit. This wonderful Christ is everything to us for our enjoyment. All that He is, is for our participation and enjoyment. </p>

This means that the good land has become a table, a feast, for our enjoyment. At this table, this feast, we are satisfied, and God is satisfied also. If we see this, we shall realize that to enter into the good land is to come to the Lord’s table. This is a most encouraging word. Praise the Lord that when we come to the table, we enter into the good land! </p>
<p data-content-id="fonV3HEy2MU2N2I0YaxDvgIBiUxgNE7RSjjm_8IXAqnMbBjw-ecpzlsiH3gTPoymz"> Our understanding of the Lord’s table has been limited by the influence of our religious background and also by our natural concepts. Because of this influence, we may think that to come to the Lord’s table is merely to attend a meeting centered around a table with a loaf and a cup.

<p data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp-nPlYhwrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen"> Do you know how the children of Israel established the kingdom of God on earth and how they built the temple of God? They did this through the enjoyment of the riches of the good land. Because the children of Israel enjoyed these riches, they could defeat their enemies. The riches of the land not only enabled the people to live; they also equipped them <span class="pg" data-page-id="449" id="449">[449]</span> to fight and bring in the kingdom of God. Furthermore, the riches of the land supplied them with what they needed to build God’s temple. Therefore, both the kingdom of God and the temple come into being through the enjoyment of the riches of the good land. The riches of the land were the source of the living of the children of Israel. These riches were also the supply for them to defeat the enemy, establish the kingdom of God, and build the temple of God. One day the glory of God descended and filled this temple. That was the consummate result of the enjoyment of the riches of the good land. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82866" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:12">6:12</span> Paul’s concern is personal, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82867" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:23">10:23</span> it is corporate. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="YAf-ThL_BpKj4Bal8Hh8S_ZBAgDwrplD5feUCEM4sdE5fnGiiRPa9o6wxsU4R57wn">FOUR PRINCIPLES</h2><p data-content-id="EKLQNzB20IJMJNZAsXkVbasdhWNIKYBtTkH0sLgDmdSh2KIOAd4oaYB8TBbVW9IBJ"> If we put together <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82868" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:12">6:12</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82869" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:23">10:23</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82870" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:31">31</span>, we have four principles concerning the believers’ walk. First, all things are lawful to the believers, but all the things they do must be expedient. This means that the things must be profitable, that is, not causing the suffering of any loss. Second, the believers must not be brought under the power of anything. Third, all things the believers do must build up others. Fourth, whatever the believers do, they must do to the glory of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82871" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:31">10:31</span>). Fully aware of these principles, Paul goes on to say in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82872" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:24">10:24</span>, “Let no one seek his own profit, but that of another.” </p>

The rest was given to the priests or to the poor, or sold again in the market. Buyers might unknowingly purchase meat that had been offered to idols. Thus, when someone went to the market to purchase meat, he might buy meat which had been used in sacrifice to idols. Regarding this, Paul tells the believers to ask no questions for the sake of conscience. This means that they should not ask questions about the meat, but simply buy it and eat it. </p>
<p data-content-id="gtgtI35Vr92rZOQoDGIVGs8NRXsfme5uwR92yUglaZ2BEOI4Y3brU9LirmsGa_3J7"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82874" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:26">verse 26</span> Paul continues, “For the earth is the Lord’s and the fullness of it.” Fullness here means the riches and also the expression. All the riches of the earth are its fullness, its expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="eUZwTHuTDFPfNYOCu1n50UUorE6pAtRKM_vM58aY_zFf532UtF6kNi_wohlwMw9hh"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82875" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:27">verse 27</span> Paul goes on to say, “If any of the unbelievers invites you, and you wish to go, eat everything that is set before you, asking no question for conscience’ sake.” On such an occasion, the believers should not investigate the situation. There is no need to ask questions. “But,” Paul continues, “if anyone should say to you, This has been offered in sacrifice, do not eat, for his sake that pointed it out and for conscience’ sake; conscience, I say, not your own, but the other’s” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82876" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:28-29">vv. 28-29a</span>). Should someone point out that the meat has been offered in sacrifice to idols, then the believers were to refrain from eating for the sake of the conscience of the one who has pointed out this fact. </p>

If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I evil spoken of concerning that for which I give thanks?” The word partake in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82879" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:30">verse 30</span> denotes eating. This clearly indicates that eating is partaking (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82880" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:17">v. 17</span>). Here “evil spoken of” means criticized with an evil purpose. If a believer is criticized in this way for eating meat sacrificed to idols, he should refrain from eating that meat. </p>

All things are lawful, but whatever we do must be, as to the thing itself, profitable; as to ourselves, not brought under the power of anything; as to others, building them up; and as to God, glorifying Him. Otherwise, nothing is permissible or acceptable. If a certain matter does not pass the test of these four principles, we should not do it. </p>

<p data-content-id="1mtnlxhyi5vxsNUaDN97plJIxKXrOz7lVo_X8hWzO2SmNPZ4cC3ocFDiy4eTOiBly"> It is possible to apply incorrectly Paul’s word about pleasing all men in all things and about seeking the advantage of the many that they may be saved. Some of those who misapply this verse say that in order to bring people to the Lord, we must come down to their level. This is to say that we must go back to the world in order to bring people to Christ. However, history has proved that this does not work. Rather, those who apply Paul’s words in this way are more likely to be brought <span class="pg" data-page-id="457" id="457">[457]</span> back to the world themselves than they are to bring others to Christ. In preaching the gospel we should not lower our standard. Instead of coming down from the mountain, we should remain on the mountain and call others to come up to where we are. We must be very careful of misusing this verse and forming it into a principle contrary to Paul’s meaning. </p>

Before we do so, however, let us first consider four verses, two from 1 Corinthians and two from 2 Corinthians. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82905" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">First Corinthians 15:45b</span> says, “The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82906" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">12:13</span> Paul declares, “For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82907" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:6">Second Corinthians 3:6</span> says that we are “ministers of a new covenant, not of letter, but of the Spirit.” Finally, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82908" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span> says, “And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.” Have you ever thought about the connection between these four verses? Two verses represent 1 Corinthians, and two, 2 Corinthians. Actually, these two books are books of the Spirit. Each of the four verses quoted above speaks of the Spirit. I believe that many Christians have not been adequately impressed with these verses. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp-nvlczwrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen">THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="HGln5zZ0kg7BRF2G3k4ch5kayK9fIchfJ5IVTxvWdxC7j7vo-3Hmf4N_nWwoJM4tK"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82909" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">15:45b</span>, Christ, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit. Before you came into the Lord’s recovery, did you know that there was a verse in the New Testament telling us that the last Adam, Christ, became a life-giving Spirit? This verse does not say that the last Adam became the Redeemer, the Savior, or the almighty Lord; it tells us that He became a life-giving Spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="460" id="460">[460]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XfZ84nrEImIc-Nz7b9qjdkNeXbVUzpA1qTctCBvDe1z-Kgbse9Vggac7oUtrY8Ta8">BAPTIZED IN THE SPIRIT TO DRINK THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="k_DHJPbquZertxEnBc6g-ljfw4I_Y_ACijldJcB2ooYdTIhcWKx_8CTD37vjRHlBO"> To some extent, believers today are familiar with Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82910" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">12:13</span>. Some make mention of this verse quite often. However, their emphasis is usually on the word baptized: in one Spirit we have all been <em>baptized.</em> Have you ever heard a message emphasizing the word <em>drink,</em> a message telling you that you have been baptized in the Spirit to drink of the Spirit? We have been baptized to drink. Therefore, we should not stop with the word baptize, but go on to realize that we have been baptized to drink. To be baptized is a matter once for all, but to drink is a continual matter. Even in eternity we shall still drink of the one Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="WPLFJeiDr66zP26-znBSbuxrk_rGZbWaygCyw9QagmclIUlGYx9j371es8KAwySLd"> The Lord Jesus as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit so that we could be baptized into this Spirit. In what Spirit have we been baptized? We have not been baptized merely in the Spirit of God. Rather, we have been baptized in the Spirit of Jesus Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82911" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">Phil. 1:19</span>). This Spirit of Jesus Christ is the life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="2x5QcsCAgui9NXQYMVnCg51gf1NTLk96DxAmczHan8nZifIVz9C609J7eMcjMZTbI"> If we were not baptized into the life-giving Spirit, how could we be baptized into one Body? The Body is not a matter of power or organization; it is an organism of life. We have been baptized organically into one Body in the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, not just the Spirit of God. If we did not have life and an organic element, how could we be living members of the Body? It would be impossible. To baptize a believer only in water does not involve life. After a person has been immersed in water, he is still a separate individual. But we have been baptized not only in water, but also in the life-giving Spirit. The water is a sign of the Spirit in which we are baptized. After a person has been baptized in the life-giving Spirit, he becomes part of the Body in an organic way. </p>
<p data-content-id="uEOnd0iMx5POKDetv2t0ZpmBAFDGOo1C5lpS1IDWbwDZZmpB_EzDqM1j3iDcpaIYK"> Because we have all been baptized in one Spirit, we are organically one Body. The reason we love all the saints, regardless of race, culture, or nationality, is that we are organically united in life. We have an organic element within us, and we are one in the life of the life-giving Spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="461" id="461">[461]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="fonV3HEy2MU2N2I0YaxDvgIBiUxgNE7RSjDm88oXAqnMbBjw-ecpzlsiH3gTPoymz"> After passing through a process, the Triune God has become such a life-giving Spirit. In such a Spirit we all have been baptized into one Body. How is it possible for us to be one Body? We can be one Body because we have been baptized in the wonderful life-giving Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp-nvlbgQrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen"> We have been baptized in this wonderful Spirit in order to drink of the Triune God. This means that baptism is not the end; rather, it is just the beginning. We who have been baptized once will drink of the life-giving Spirit for eternity. </p>
<p data-content-id="HGln5zZ0kg7BRF2G3k4ch5kayK9fIchfJ5IVVifWdxC7j7vo-3Hmf4N_nWwoJM4tK"> There is a marvelous connection between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82912" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">12:13</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82913" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22:1</span>, where we are told that the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. This river will flow throughout the entire New Jerusalem so that everyone may drink of the water of life. In eternity the water of life will be our drink. We have been baptized to drink the Spirit, the water of life, for eternity. </p>
<p data-content-id="XfZ84nrEImIc-Nz7b9qjdkNeXbVUzpA1qTctLSvDe1z-Kgbse9Vggac7oUtrY8Ta8"> The book of 1 Corinthians teaches that the last Adam, God incarnate, has become a life-giving Spirit, and that in this Spirit we have all been baptized into one Body. Now, as those baptized in the life-giving Spirit, we need to drink the Spirit. Day by day, we should drink. Whenever we pray, pray-read, or call, “O Lord Jesus,” we may drink. As we fellowship with the saints, we should also drink of the Spirit. Sometimes when I drink of the Spirit, I am beside myself with joy. Hallelujah, we have been baptized into the one Body to drink of the life-giving Spirit! What a marvelous revelation! </p>

Then we become ministers of a new covenant, “not of letter, but of the Spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82914" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:6">2 Cor. 3:6</span>). The new covenant is not of law, but of Christ who has become the life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="zjs7tyZL5uIfKl2-jisuY3zjK1KLXAhZGS-hfFIaRDYk9Z7bsjPuLM57LGu0lUUp1"> Christ’s becoming the life-giving Spirit implies all the steps of His process: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. It also includes redemption. The goal of <span class="pg" data-page-id="462" id="462">[462]</span> this process is not incarnation, crucifixion, or even resurrection; the goal is the life-giving Spirit. This is the new covenant. Therefore, the new covenant implies incarnation; that is, it implies God becoming a man and living as a man on earth. The new covenant also implies that this incarnated One went to the cross and died for our sins, and even for ourselves, in order to terminate the old creation. After shedding His blood on the cross and dying for us, this One was buried and then entered into resurrection. When He came into resurrection, He reached the destination—the life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="anLB0qPKqLGVpnELJCF3jkmpBzp5jxv0rsSn_2Rcw1YQmFAHifmPHXLBQ92ZO24yM"> In this wonderful Spirit we all have been baptized into one Body. Now as we drink this Spirit and are saturated with Him, we spontaneously become ministers of the new covenant, a covenant of the Spirit. Therefore, we should not minister mere doctrines and letters. On the contrary, we must minister the Spirit. We must serve others the heavenly drink with which we have been saturated. Let us all be ministers not of doctrines or letters, but of life and of the Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="b6PkOnBRxPH-JZwYqEGn8CHT8qNMfaW8Hd1W6pwUwlEPRETelPUlRIL-iaR1qLEZU">TRANSFORMATION <br/>FROM THE LORD SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="qPvGt579Xg2208_F-Y_Px3PmmtBqvIPphe4-jGvjo8q_UxMIXkBSVMp3PZrkIuHbS"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82915" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span>, not only should we be ministers of the Spirit, but we should also be “transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82916" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">v. 18</span>). In all that we do in the church life—in meetings, in fellowship, in serving, in giving and receiving hospitality—we should be undergoing the process of transformation. We all are being transformed into the Lord’s image from glory to glory, from one degree of glory to another. This is from the Lord Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="yV3PEIgX1GeafzM-ZlWqiZrLTlMVVP6QhVre_Hbd8-szYYywPm2y0AATrFvXenxHw"> I deeply appreciate these four verses. The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. We have been baptized in this Spirit and are now drinking the Spirit. Furthermore, as we are saturated with the Spirit, we become ministers of the Spirit. Moreover, we are in the process of being transformed from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit. First and 2 Corinthians certainly are books of the Spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="463" id="463">[463]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8mSjN8Zzt62gkGo0MycXHksy-YBKtJWbc4Zv1OSOa49_JwqOmHn6fmadytYtxsWL6">PROBLEMS IN THE REALM OF HUMAN LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="0lPdjYmGFHiI5J5XxCYQsri-H6UWaL3fWaYmTmpY3_7MOfbRgf2qmCmeLk8UjNCJ1"> At this point it will be helpful to see the Epistle of 1 Corinthians as a whole, to have an overview, a bird’s-eye view, of the entire book. When Paul wrote this Epistle, he was deeply burdened in his spirit. This book deals with the problems among the saints in a very disturbed and disorderly church. The saints at Corinth had been misled, and there was disorder among them. Hence, Paul, the apostle, burdened for that church, wrote this Epistle to clarify the situation by dealing with the problems one by one. </p>

THE HEADSHIP</h2><p data-content-id="_PQd6AGHMk6jAgPz44nxU9j8ur2zdeZux_U2rElAEy7EqNuVxyNwhicQJPFxcqffg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82946" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:3">verse 3</span> Paul says, “But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.” This verse through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82947" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:16">verse 16</span> deals with the seventh problem, the problem concerning head covering. The first six problems, dealt with in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82948" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">chapters one through ten</span>, may be considered one group. They are concerned with matters in the realm of human life. The last five problems, dealt with in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82949" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">chapters eleven through sixteen</span>, are another group. They are concerned with matters in the realm of God’s administration. The first is concerning the headship of Christ and of God in the divine government. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82950" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22-23">Ephesians 1:22 and 23</span> the headship of Christ over all things is to His Body, the church. Here the headship of Christ over every man is concerning individuals. Christ is both the Head corporately of the Body, the church, and individually of the believers. He is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="470" id="470">[470]</span> Head directly of every one of us. In the apostle’s dealing with the Corinthians’ problems concerning God’s administration, this matter of the headship of Christ and of God is his first concern. </p>
<p data-content-id="eUZwTHuTDFPfNYOCu1n50UUorE6pAtRKM_PM5-aY_zFf532UtF6kNi_wohlwMw9hh">In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82951" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:3">verse 3</span> Paul points out that the head of the woman is the man. In the divine governmental ordination, woman is under the headship of man. God created the female in this way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82952" data-verses="Genesis 2:18-24">Gen. 2:18-24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82953" data-verses="1Timothy 2:13">1 Tim. 2:13</span>). According to the nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82954" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:14">1 Cor. 11:14</span>) created by God, woman is subordinate to man. </p>
<p data-content-id="5cvwE7fG0BCj-rNo6NGmlSxcfn8js06QGICHjBiKtAHd3P8c8SI8FsHkl6iaraK0i"> Paul also says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82955" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:3">verse 3</span> that the head of Christ is God. Christ is God’s anointed One, appointed by God. Hence, He is under God, and God as the originator is His Head. This refers to the relationship between Christ and God in the divine government. </p>
<p data-content-id="N9DQWvp40eBT2VybP3ap72SyWkeUtkAvjCfyCQS_h8YrqVB4HFvlImtcJ6D_lT9Tg"> In dealing with the problem of head covering, the apostle takes the headship of God, the headship of Christ, and the headship of man as strong ground for his instruction. His instruction concerning head covering is not based upon any religious practices or human customs, but based upon the headship in God’s governmental administration. Such a strong base leaves no ground for any argument over the matter of head covering. </p>
<p data-content-id="tiNQgxDpsd4NWazI4KY7Ls3Zc1jf31TN6nW0omJv7jbyJhqTUCAeHZ8B89sG6uKJy"> Soon after I was saved, I heard a great deal of talk about head covering. Some argued that Paul spoke concerning head covering because in his time there was such a custom among the people. Later, thorough study made it clear that there was no such custom either among the Greeks or the Jews. Actually, according to Jewish custom, it was the priests who were required to cover their heads. Paul’s teaching in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82956" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">1 Corinthians 11</span> is not based on any custom found in the Mediterranean area. On the contrary, his teaching is according to divine revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="h8T7ZUYpMcEVtTeTw4Ei-WaWWau_ZtkWG1p7SgFWsI31mZB3IXYJad2ffrJvNMmVr"> The reason we need head covering in the church is that head covering is related to the headship of God. This is the reason Paul speaks the way he does in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82957" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:3">11:3</span>, telling us that he wants us to know that the head of every man is Christ, that the head of the woman is the man, and that the head <span class="pg" data-page-id="471" id="471">[471]</span> of Christ is God. Thus, head covering is related to the headship in God’s government. In the universe, especially in God’s governmental administration, there is order. God is the head over Christ, Christ is the head over every man, and man is the head over the woman. Therefore, in the church meetings the sisters should wear a head covering to signify that we recognize God’s authority and respect His headship and that we are not a people rebellious against God. Instead, we are absolutely submissive to Him and signify this by having a head covering. However, although this has been our practice for more than fifty years, we have never forced anyone to participate in such a practice. We do not want to make head covering a mere outward formality. But it is a fact that the Bible reveals that the church should have such a sign declaring that we are a people under God’s headship. </p>

Since man has the headship over woman and is God’s image and glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82959" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:7">v. 7</span>), he should keep his head manifested, unconcealed, uncovered, when he prays to God and speaks for Him in touching the throne of God’s administration. Otherwise he dishonors or shames his head. </p>
<p data-content-id="imdufFGU1VpsTYYg4sAVUG-TWWELatFvQm83HLW7L7B-Rv1HfZsOuLeAEkuDTcJUK"> We should not think that praying or speaking for God by prophesying are insignificant matters. It is a great thing to speak for God. Both our prayer and our speaking for God are related to God’s administration. They are related to God’s authority and headship. Therefore, as those who are God’s image and glory, the men should not cover their heads when praying or prophesying. To cover our head in this way is to shame our head. <span class="pg" data-page-id="472" id="472">[472]</span> </p>

Otherwise she disgraces or shames her head, as if having her head shaved, because she denies the divine governmental ordination by exposing her head to the observing angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82961" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:10">v. 10</span>) when she touches the authority of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="jfI-61Rh_EbH_IA1gDUEXyzj4P3_cZ1Wr_wVT1uJ9jg9A32Kw2FtbNOlkIQAhHCHk"> Paul tells us that a woman who disgraces her head is the same as one who is shaved. This is a strong indication that for a woman to have her head shaved or her hair cut off is shameful (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82962" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:6">v. 6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="TgPV7WYzePxLg1dlN-g0NWu5ni7DunVUx3z8qp042YLj5QKtSQNXUKE8xxgPy_6YT"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82963" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:6">Verse 6</span> says, “For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off; but if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.” This indicates that the head covering is a covering in addition to long hair. For a woman to have long hair, not having her head shaved, signifies that she does not reject God’s governmental ordination; and for a woman to have a head covering in addition to her long hair is to say amen to the divine ordination. </p>

<p data-content-id="RKpt0z8nFNlHi_3vAHu8OcgGgYOj-shs9G-S1u7EU8dkYiKR-u6Z0ZA1R2xXn3ai4"> One reason for head covering is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82964" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:7">verse 7</span>: “For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, being God’s image and glory; but the woman is the glory of a man.” Man was made in God’s image (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="82965" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Gen. 1:26</span>) to express God and glorify Him. Since man bears God’s image and glory and represents God, he ought not to have his head covered. If he does, God’s image and glory will be concealed. Since <span class="pg" data-page-id="473" id="473">[473]</span> woman is the glory of man, she ought not to have her head expressed but covered. She should not express herself but the man, under whom she is. This is also a ground taken by the apostle for his teaching of head covering. </p>

<p data-content-id="ldCSVKCXVHzwbcJAktI5qY9WW0m-zAHEfxRHFIiwzcGvha9kv82E6htYPVBgcHt9H"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82997" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:1">chapter ten</span> of 1 Corinthians Paul speaks concerning the Lord’s table. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82998" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:16">10:16</span> he asks, “The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a fellowship of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a fellowship of the body of Christ?” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="82999" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:21">verse 21</span> he goes on to say, “You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and of the table of demons.” Since Paul has already begun to talk about the Lord’s table, why does he not go on directly to speak concerning the Lord’s supper? Why does he bring in the matter of headship, or head covering, after his word about the Lord’s table and before that about the Lord’s supper? This seems to be neither logical nor reasonable. However, there is a reason for this interruption. </p>
<p data-content-id="OT5FVjm4b3rEEp9If2G1UsfkTjficISBMmQulajvH9vLo8q-qnrQL8cvvI2WkbUHd"> In the first ten chapters of this Epistle Paul deals with problems related to the Christian life; he does not deal with God’s administration. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83000" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">chapter eleven</span> he begins to deal with matters related to God’s administration. In the divine administration the first concern is God’s headship. Whenever God’s headship is honored, then all the matters related to God’s administration will be proper. But when God’s headship is dishonored, all these matters will be improper. This is the reason that Paul brings in the matter of headship before continuing to deal with the Lord’s supper. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="45d-EDyyRdejyAtIco9vv--MfBFfH5nEd3iwZs_J1z9MAZSXg-0MsBpqMhRa6rO3L">THE LORD’S TABLE AND THE LORD’S SUPPER</h2><p data-content-id="oHvwn1F9kPbTytIPVynf_MGPeusawFjhUqpM6crfRRrtjdCyM9IgKVBeI7sBRsMLT"> Concerning the remembrance of the Lord, Paul uses the term “the table of the Lord” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83001" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:21">10:21</span> and “the Lord’s supper” <span class="pg" data-page-id="480" id="480">[480]</span> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83002" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:20">11:20</span>. There is an important difference between the Lord’s table and the Lord’s supper. We should not take these terms for granted. Rather, we should ask why Paul speaks of the Lord’s table in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83003" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:1">chapter ten</span> and the Lord’s supper in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83004" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">chapter eleven</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="JIZ-QykqNDG1BWmM2KnMOMhZju_iNYeGXiYtctvoJZcGOh57N2xS8o8hJ8R-wu70-"> The Lord’s table refers to the enjoyment of the Lord in fellowship. Hence, the significance of the Lord’s table is enjoyment for participation, enjoyment for fellowship. When we say that we take the Lord’s table, we mean that we enjoy the Lord in the fellowship of Him. This is for our enjoyment and satisfaction. The Lord’s supper, however, is for His satisfaction. It is for the remembrance of Him. Regarding the Lord’s table and the Lord’s supper, there is mutuality. The Lord’s table is for our enjoyment, but the Lord’s supper is for His enjoyment. Sometimes we may say, “Lord, we come to Your table and partake of it.” This indicates that we are enjoying the Lord. At other times we may say, “We thank You that we can have Your supper.” This indicates that we are remembering the Lord for His enjoyment and satisfaction. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="zjs7tyZL5uIfKl2-jisuY3zjK1KLXAhZGTehfHIaRDYk9Z7bsjPuLM57LGu0lUUp1">THE PHYSICAL BODY AND THE MYSTICAL BODY</h2><p data-content-id="anLB0qPKqLGVpnELJCF3jkmpBzp5jxv0rtyn82xcw1YQmFAHifmPHXLBQ92ZO24yM"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83005" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:29">11:29</span> Paul uses the expression “the body.” In the New Testament the Body denotes the mystical Body of Christ in the Spirit. However, since Paul in this portion is speaking about the Lord’s supper, the body here must also denote the body of Jesus. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83006" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:24">verse 24</span> Paul quotes the word of the Lord Jesus: “This is My body, which is for you; this do for the remembrance of Me.” Does this refer to His physical body or to the mystical Body? The words “for you” indicate that the body here denotes the Lord’s physical body. His physical body is for us, whereas the mystical Body of Christ is for Him. The church today as the mystical Body is not for us—it is for Christ. But the physical body of Jesus which was crucified is for us. Therefore, in remembrance of the Lord we partake of the bread which signifies His physical body. </p>
<p data-content-id="b6PkOnBRxPH-JZwYqEGn8CHT8qNMfaW8HcVW5pQUwlEPRETelPUlRIL-iaR1qLEZU"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83007" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:25">First Corinthians 11:25</span> says, “Similarly also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in My <span class="pg" data-page-id="481" id="481">[481]</span> blood; this do, as often as you drink it, for the remembrance of Me.” The blood here surely refers to the physical blood, not to the mystical blood. We partake of the cup also in remembrance of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="qPvGt579Xg2208_F-Y_Px3PmmtBqvIPphfY-gHPjo8q_UxMIXkBSVMp3PZrkIuHbS"> Although the body in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83008" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:24">11:24</span> denotes the physical body of Jesus, Paul uses the expression, “not discerning the body,” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83009" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:29">verse 29</span> to denote also the mystical Body. Some may argue that discerning the body in this verse means to discern only the physical body of Jesus from ordinary food. In this verse Paul mentions eating and drinking. Eating is related to the physical body and drinking to physical blood; however, at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83010" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:29">verse 29</span> Paul does not speak of not discerning the blood and the body nor of not discerning the body and the blood. Rather, he speaks only of not discerning the body. Therefore, this discernment does not refer only to the discernment of the physical body and blood of Jesus from ordinary food and drink. The meaning of discerning the body here involves something more. </p>
<p data-content-id="yV3PEIgX1GeafzM-ZlWqiZrLTlMVVP6QhULe8G7d8-szYYywPm2y0AATrFvXenxHw"> The physical body of Jesus was given on the cross to accomplish redemption for us. But that body has nothing to do with God’s present administration. It is the mystical Body of Christ which is thoroughly and absolutely related to God’s administration today. Apart from the mystical Body of Christ, God has no way, no means, to carry out His administration. This means that God’s administration is being carried out through the mystical Body of Christ. What are we doing on earth as the mystical Body of Christ? We certainly are not working for the accomplishment of redemption, for redemption has been accomplished once for all by the Lord Jesus. Redemption has been fully accomplished by the offering of the physical body of Jesus on the cross. But Christ today has a mystical Body, and this Body is for the carrying out of God’s administration. </p>
<p data-content-id="8mSjN8Zzt62gkGo0MycXHksy-YBKtJWbc55v2OyOa49_JwqOmHn6fmadytYtxsWL6"> When we come to the Lord’s table, our concern is neither redemption nor the divine administration; our concern is for enjoyment. We all come to the Lord’s table to enjoy the Lord in fellowship. We probably do not have any thought of God’s administration. The Lord’s supper, however, is related to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="482" id="482">[482]</span> Lord’s enjoyment and satisfaction. We should not only care for our enjoyment at the table, but also care for the Lord’s enjoyment at the supper. We may have a heart for our enjoyment of the table, the feast, but not have much of a heart for the Lord’s remembrance. We may care for our satisfaction, but not care for the Lord’s satisfaction. Therefore, we need more light from the Lord concerning the Lord’s supper. This will cause our meetings around His table to be improved. We shall praise the Lord that the supper is for His remembrance, enjoyment, and satisfaction. We shall realize that we are not only for our satisfaction, but even the more for God to be satisfied by Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="0lPdjYmGFHiI5J5XxCYQsri-H6UWaL3fWb4mQmJY3_7MOfbRgf2qmCmeLk8UjNCJ1"> If we want the Lord Jesus to be satisfied at the Lord’s supper, we should not only remember Him, but also care for God’s administration carried out by Him. Today what satisfies the Lord the most is the divine administration. If we remember Him without caring for the divine administration, He will not be happy. If we want to make Him happy and satisfy Him, we must be able to say, “Lord, while we are remembering You, we discern Your Body for God’s administration carried out by You. As we remember You, we do not forget what You are doing in the heavens. You are seated in the heavens to carry out God’s administration.” </p>

His first coming was for our redemption, but His second coming will be for God’s administration. When we take of the Lord’s table, we care for our enjoyment. But when we take of the Lord’s supper, we care for His remembrance and God’s administration. The Lord’s table is for our enjoyment. However, the Lord’s supper is for His enjoyment and satisfaction. Furthermore, His satisfaction is dependent on God’s administration carried out by Him. Do you intend to give the <span class="pg" data-page-id="483" id="483">[483]</span> Lord the best remembrance? If you do, then you must take care of the mystical Body, the means for Him to carry out God’s administration on earth. We must remember Him in this way until He comes. We do this to carry out His administration until He comes back and brings His kingdom to earth. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83018" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:17">verse 17</span> he says, “But in giving this charge, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.” The word “but” here indicates a contrast between “I do not praise you” and “I praise you” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83019" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:2">verse 2</span>. From this verse through the end of the chapter, the apostle deals with the eighth problem, the problem concerning the Lord’s supper. </p>
<p data-content-id="imdufFGU1VpsTYYg4sAVUG-TWWELatFvQnc3HJW7L7B-Rv1HfZsOuLeAEkuDTcJUK"> Paul is honest and frank. When the believers should be praised, he praises them. But when they should not be praised, he does not praise them. Although Paul does not say in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83020" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:17">verse 17</span>, “I rebuke you,” he nonetheless speaks to them in a rebuking tone. </p>

This indicates that the meeting together of the believers may be a loss instead of a profit. The expression “not for <span class="pg" data-page-id="488" id="488">[488]</span> the better but for the worse” means that the result of the Corinthians coming together was not profit but loss, that the result of their meeting was not gain but loss. Some Corinthians became weak, others became sick, and some even died. This proves that they lost a great deal. </p>

He does not say that he fully believed all he heard; on the contrary he says that he believed a certain part. This reveals his soft tone in rebuking the Corinthians. The expression “in the church” means in the assembly of the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83023" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:34-35">14:34-35</span>). </p>

The word approved means tested that the specifications have been met. According to this verse, even the parties, the sects, are useful to manifest the approved ones, those who are not sectarian. </p>

As we have seen, the emphasis of the table of the Lord is the fellowship of His blood and of His body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83028" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:16-17">10:16-17</span>), the participation in the Lord, the enjoyment of the Lord in mutuality, in fellowship; whereas the emphasis of the Lord’s supper is the remembrance of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83029" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:24-25">11:24-25</span>). At the Lord’s table we receive His body and blood for our enjoyment; at the Lord’s supper we give Him our remembrance for His enjoyment. <span class="pg" data-page-id="489" id="489">[489]</span> </p>

This was called the feast of love (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83031" data-verses="2Peter 2:13">2 Pet. 2:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83032" data-verses="Jude 1:12">Jude 12</span>) and came from the background of the Passover feast (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83033" data-verses="Luke 22:13-20">Luke 22:13-20</span>). At the end of their love feast they ate the Lord’s supper with the bread and the cup to remember the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83034" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:23-25">1 Cor. 11:23-25</span>). The Corinthians did not do this properly. They did not wait for one another (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83035" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:33">v. 33</span>). Each took his own supper first. The rich became drunken and the poor were hungry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83036" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:21">v. 21</span>). This caused divisions and parties among them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83037" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:18">v. 18</span>). Hence, they spoiled the Lord’s supper. Thus, their eating was not the eating of the Lord’s supper (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83038" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:20">v. 20</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83039" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:22">verse 22</span> Paul said to them, “What! Do you not have houses to eat and to drink in?

To take the Lord’s supper is for the remembrance of the Lord Himself. <span class="pg" data-page-id="490" id="490">[490]</span> </p>

This cup is the new covenant, made up of all the rich blessings of the New Testament, including God Himself. It was enacted by the Lord’s blood, which He shed on the cross for our redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83046" data-verses="Matthew 26:28">Matt. 26:28</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="CFF3xQmaFvwJ5j4xk2Wr_M9AHisFFvvZBx4jivFhhQwaE4qISeDhS6DHqSHn3a8XL"> The real remembrance of the Lord is to eat the bread and drink the cup (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83047" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:26">11:26</span>), that is, to participate in, to enjoy, the Lord who has given Himself to us through His redeeming death. To eat the bread and drink the cup is to take in the redeeming Lord as our portion, as our life and blessing. This is to remember Him in a genuine way. </p>

To take the Lord’s supper is to declare and display the Lord’s death, rather than remember it. We remember the Lord Himself by declaring and displaying His death. Please notice that we remember the Person of the Lord, but we declare, proclaim, His death. We remember the Person by declaring His death to the entire universe: to the demons, to the angels, and to human beings. </p>

Similarly also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, for the remembrance of Me.” In the phrase “for the remembrance of Me,” it is better to translate the Greek word rendered “for” as “unto.” Thus, it should read “unto the remembrance of Me.” The word “unto” implies a result, whereas the word “for” indicates a purpose. Having a purpose is not as good as having a result. </p>
<p data-content-id="9eaN6Fdd37GIAwbbB4iu5JzKVZeyCcOvcvBTrrngEMpuLpI4URJ1klC1LrBzVosWL"> To have the Lord’s supper for the remembrance of the Lord means that we have the supper for the purpose of remembering Him. But to have the Lord’s supper unto the remembrance of the Lord means that we have the supper with the result that we remember the Lord. We may come to partake of the Lord’s supper with the purpose of remembering Him and yet our eating of the supper may not result in the remembrance of the Lord. Instead of having the proper remembrance of the Lord, the result may be condemnation on us. Supposedly the believers at Corinth came together to remember the Lord. But the result was altogether different. Their eating and drinking was not unto the remembrance of the Lord, but unto their own condemnation. </p>
<p data-content-id="jfI-61Rh_EbH_IA1gDUEXyzj4P3_cZ1Wr-gVYneJ9jg9A32Kw2FtbNOlkIQAhHCHk"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83075" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">chapter eleven</span> Paul was admonishing the Corinthians <span class="pg" data-page-id="496" id="496">[496]</span> to have the Lord’s supper in a way that would result not in their condemnation but in the remembrance of the Lord. It is possible that the result of our eating of the Lord’s supper may also be condemnation instead of the remembrance of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="7UhQ1h6ietnCG3iSYMQGeKol8eEauxoK13eSFHoQc6bIZTcaCCwQEPzHoI6-oWcib"> The thought embodied in the word “unto” in these verses is deep and profound. It is, of course, not incorrect to translate the Greek preposition as “for.” However, this does not express the meaning or significance here. Here the word is used with the significance of result, not purpose. What will be the result of your eating of the Lord’s supper? Will it result in the remembrance of the Lord, or in condemnation for wrongdoing? This was Paul’s sober word to the Corinthians. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PQd6AGHMk6jAgPz44nxU9j8ur2zdeZux-E2jWVAEy7EqNuVxyNwhicQJPFxcqffg"> The eating of the Lord’s supper is to satisfy the Lord. But instead of coming together to satisfy the Lord, the Corinthians were seeking to satisfy themselves. The fact that some even became drunk proves that they cared for their own satisfaction (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83076" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:21">v. 21</span>). To come to the Lord’s supper with the intention of receiving satisfaction for ourselves is against the principle of His supper. We should not come to the Lord’s supper with such an intention. Rather, we should come with the intention to satisfy the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="BlFnrZica4yWuQnA7t-H0gDU5fwQYidCzQRvHO3utg7GeZB2ROy6rbjikKwq_wK8F"> Merely to render the Lord some kind of shallow remembrance does not satisfy Him. He is satisfied when we have the supper in such a way that it results in the remembrance of Him. Simply to remember the Lord is shallow. But to partake of the Lord’s supper with the result that we have the remembrance of Him is deep. Remembering the Lord is something temporary. It may last only while we are eating of His supper. As we are eating of the supper, we remember Him. But to eat the Lord’s supper resulting in the remembrance of the Lord implies that the remembrance is coming and also that it will continue after we have finished eating. Thus, the remembrance is a continuation of our eating. Our eating results in the remembrance, and the remembrance is the continuation of the eating. <span class="pg" data-page-id="497" id="497">[497]</span> </p>

Now His love constrains me in the evening of the Lord’s Day to remember Him by eating His supper. As I partake of the supper, I remember Him. I remember His incarnation and how he was born of a virgin in Bethlehem. I remember how He grew up in the city of Nazareth, how He suffered and was persecuted, how He was betrayed, judged, condemned, and sentenced to die on the cross. I especially remember that on the cross He died for my sins.” To remember the Lord in this way is good, but it does not have anything to do with the kingdom, with God’s administration. After the Lord’s supper, there is no lasting result with respect to the remembrance of the Lord. If our eating of the Lord’s supper stops with this kind of remembrance, our partaking of the Lord’s supper is too superficial. The genuine eating of the Lord’s supper must result in the administration of God; it must result in the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="QM-bErH4QMuLGtlKhNiUmVseR6-Mo4MAJZmMZ95bAWzUJ836Exkha9TFHxEakh9zT"> Our eating of the Lord’s supper must be related to the kingdom. It should not be without a continuing result after each partaking of the Lord’s supper is over. On the contrary, it must result in the kingdom, the administration of God. In other words, our eating of the Lord’s supper must result in satisfying Him by bringing in the kingdom, by having ourselves and everything related to us brought into a proper relationship with God’s administration. This is not a matter <span class="pg" data-page-id="498" id="498">[498]</span> that can take place in an hour’s time. It can be accomplished only by a process which is yet to come. This coming process is actually the kingdom of God, God’s administration, being worked out on earth. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="K9Fhzhq9ETFPCPzdkFWRrkfkDyu0qmgIuwC5siP0zVrET7fYv2qxzXlZDmd0Kk9SX">PROVING AND DISCERNING</h2><p data-content-id="ldCSVKCXVHzwbcJAktI5qY9WW0m-zAHEfxxHCYCwzcGvha9kv82E6htYPVBgcHt9H"> Because the relation between the Lord’s supper and God’s administration is a very serious matter, Paul charges the Corinthians to prove themselves and discern the body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83079" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:28-29">vv. 28-29</span>). If we do not prove ourselves and if we do not discern the body, we may eat the Lord’s supper without having the result of the remembrance of the Lord. We need to prove ourselves that our standing is proper, and we must also discern the body. Then our eating of the Lord’s supper will result in a full satisfaction to the Lord and also in the carrying out of the administration of God. This is the proper eating of the Lord’s supper. </p>
<p data-content-id="OT5FVjm4b3rEEp9If2G1UsfkTjficISBMmwujKTvH9vLo8q-qnrQL8cvvI2WkbUHd"> Perhaps you are wondering how the eating of the Lord’s supper can result in the carrying out of God’s administration. As Christians, we have been saved, we have been born of God to be the children of God, and we have been brought into the kingdom of God. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83080" data-verses="John 3:3">John 3:3</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83081" data-verses="John 3:5">5</span>, regeneration brings us into the kingdom of God. If we had not been born of the Spirit, we could not enter into the kingdom of God. But through regeneration we have been brought into God’s kingdom and have also become members of the Body of Christ. We need to realize that we have been regenerated to become the children of God, to be brought into the kingdom, and to become the members of the Body of Christ. Once we have this realization, we need to consider the purpose of all this. Why have we been regenerated to be brought into the kingdom and to become the members of the Body? The answer is that we have been regenerated so that we may live a life for the kingdom of God and the Body of Christ. The kingdom and the Body should be the goal of our living. </p>

<p data-content-id="LCOBHh-_8rtpkoOSBhuJ3SLJouiGtADmXdrcB07K7WCcffclCOEo5EYkos9Kc9G0W"> Why does Paul deal with the gifts immediately after speaking about the Lord’s supper? Apparently there is no connection between the Lord’s supper and the gifts. Many readers of the Bible have found it difficult to understand why Paul deals first with the Lord’s supper and then with the gifts. If we would understand the connection between these two matters, we must see that they are related to God’s administration. The divine administration is the secret to the five problems covered in the last six chapters of 1 Corinthians. Therefore, if we see that this section of the book is concerned with things in the realm of the divine administration, we shall have the key to understanding these chapters. </p>
<p data-content-id="mA_96h-ZPzHjy0DOYoWw3UVdng1dAcNQMZ60lMc6FnoHymfKQciucRWHW48k6Jjdb"> The first matter covered in this section is head covering, which is related to headship. Headship is the first item in God’s administration. Just as head covering is related to the headship, so the Lord’s supper is related to the Body. The Body is the means by which God carries out His administration. Without the Body, the Head cannot accomplish anything on earth for the carrying out of God’s administration. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zjyvva9_mwbWU7v14CMragfkXMl76M85GJYYili2npxvRcj28K_niY4FY2FqTLVIx"> Now we must go on to see that with the Body there is the need of the different functions. If my physical body did not have any functions, the body would not be able to do anything. However, in every member of my body there is a function. The function comes out of the gift of each member. The finger, the hand, the arm, and the shoulder all have <span class="pg" data-page-id="508" id="508">[508]</span> their gifts. Every member of our body, no matter how small or unimportant it may seem, has a gift. As long as it is a member of the body, it has a gift, and with the gift, there is the function. By means of the functions of all the members of the body, the body is able to work. The totality of the functions of the gifts of all the members in the body is the work of the body. When I speak, every member of my body is involved. Every part of my body, every muscle, even the nose and the ears, are functioning. </p>
<p data-content-id="A3Oa3UPcjrJzR4wlouzXCJftgWRSWHHN6ImG86cifE_yD30wsSCVCR1Rhevz1xRO7"> God is administrating the entire universe for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. Christ, the Head, needs the Body, the church. This is the reason Satan hates the church. We are opposed today simply because we are standing for the church. There are Christian bookstores that carry all the books by Brother Nee except his books on the church. Certain missionaries in Taiwan admitted that our work there was excellent, but they regarded the matter of the church practice as a “dead fly in the ointment.” </p>
<p data-content-id="sekrxE0ekH4YzjuJnZ6t8c3cdplKbmWof4itdesSkFLy5jYO71G6nuPBp_WYYIECE"> Satan hates the Body and opposes it. If the church were only an assembly of believers coming together for fellowship, Satan would not hate the church so much. However, for us, the church is not merely an assembly; it is the Body for the carrying out of God’s administration. In order to be such a church, we all need to function. Suppose, however, we have a church in which only a few members function and the rest sit in the meetings without functioning. A church in that situation may be opposed by the enemy, but not nearly as much as those who stand for the Body, the instrument of the Head for carrying out the divine administration. </p>
<p data-content-id="wIQrvVteeI1oKV87cJZVVv5dOgX231XUqp1UyTHr25XvLEhXjHSjbC3_2HzXXD3x4"> The Body has many members, and every member has a gift. This is the reason that after the headship and the Body, Paul comes to the matter of the spiritual gifts. The spiritual gifts are for the functions of the members of the Body. Hence, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83099" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapter twelve</span> is the direct continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83100" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">chapter eleven</span>. After discerning the Body, we need to see the importance of all the gifts of the members of the Body. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83101" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:4-11">12:4-11</span> Paul mentions nine gifts. This does not mean that there are only nine spiritual gifts. Paul lists nine gifts as an illustration. <span class="pg" data-page-id="509" id="509">[509]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83103" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">verse 1</span> Paul says, “Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83104" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapters twelve through fourteen</span> Paul deals with the ninth problem among the Corinthians, the problem of spiritual gifts in relation to God’s administration and operation. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zjyvva9_mwbWU7v14CMragfkXMl76M85GJYYr2C2npxvRcj28K_niY4FY2FqTLVIx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83105" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:2-3">verses 2 and 3</span> Paul continues, “You know that when you were of the nations, you were led away to dumb idols, however you were led. Wherefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.” The apostle’s thought here is that the dumb, voiceless idols in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83106" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:2">verse 2</span> make their worshippers dumb and voiceless. But the living God causes His worshippers to speak in His Spirit. This kind of speaking is related to the spiritual gifts. No one who speaks in the Spirit of God would say, “Jesus is accursed”; he would like to say and he is able to say, “Lord Jesus.” No worshippers of God should be silent, but all should use their voices to speak forth the Lord Jesus in the Spirit of God. This—to speak the Lord Jesus—is the main function of all the spiritual gifts. </p>
<p data-content-id="A3Oa3UPcjrJzR4wlouzXCJftgWRSWHHN6ImG0psifE_yD30wsSCVCR1Rhevz1xRO7"> The governing principle of the gifts is to speak by our spirit with the Spirit, that is, to utter something with the Spirit in our spirit. This kind of speaking is centered on the Lord Jesus. Therefore, what we speak should be focused on Christ. Christ should be the substance, the element, the essence, the center, and the circumference of our speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="F_0pIc17fjqQrLFCajrHceBnEm3EkINB8pYu9MMW-twLqCp0pOLPqCxrSvbNiuAOt"> When Paul writes about the gifts of the members of the Body, he begins by speaking of “dumb idols.” The gifts, of course, have nothing to do with idols. But what Paul says concerning the spiritual gifts is spoken against the Corinthians’ background in idol worship. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83107" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:2">verse 2</span> Paul reminds them that when they were of the nations, of the Gentiles, they were “led away to dumb idols.” Here Paul does not say they were led away to sins, lusts, or the world; he says that they were led away to dumb idols, in whatever way they were led. No matter by what way they were led, they <span class="pg" data-page-id="510" id="510">[510]</span> were led to dumb idols. Paul’s use of the adjective “dumb” implies that both the idols and those who worship them are dumb, unable to speak. When the Corinthians were unbelievers, they also were dumb; they were silent worshippers of dumb idols. This means that when they worshipped the idols, they did not speak. Rather, because the idols were dumb, they also were dumb, silent. But after coming to believe in Christ, they are now worshippers of the living God. </p>
<p data-content-id="CFF3xQmaFvwJ5j4xk2Wr_M9AHisFFvvZBxYjhvlhhQwaE4qISeDhS6DHqSHn3a8XL"> It is by speaking that we prove that we are living. Our God is living. The Bible reveals that our living God is the speaking God. Throughout the centuries, especially in this New Testament age, God has been speaking. To prove that we are a living member of Christ, we also must speak. We do not mean, of course, that we should speak in a light way or that we should gossip. Instead, we should speak something for the Lord and even speak forth the Lord. We need to speak things which are centered on Christ. Furthermore, Christ must be our speaking, our utterance. He must be the center and circumference of our speech. To speak Christ in this way is a strong proof that we are living. Because the God whom we worship is the living and speaking God, we also speak and thereby prove that we are the living members of the Body of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="PxQUR1aSfVg1g5EN0uN6GBmA7oa_DRqoDAI2oIF94p-AdYjLrSH1ujpvA-dj4BNGp"> I can testify from experience that the more I speak, the more living I am. To speak is actually to breathe. When I speak by exercising my spirit, I breathe Christ in. Day by day, we need to speak Christ to our husband or wife, to our children, and to our neighbors. We need to speak Christ, taking Him as our center. This speaking is the governing principle of the spiritual gifts. </p>
<p data-content-id="-31E-FlFhHZVWfRVsibLPN9Po-xOz3xA0OZ5Vt-NyImqaLANCOsF5aHepDtdpWJmP"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83108" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:3">verse 3</span>, our speaking must be governed by the Lord Jesus. In this verse Paul says, “Wherefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed.” The Greek words rendered, “Jesus is accursed,” literally are “Anathema Jesus.” Anathema denotes a thing or person accursed; set apart, devoted, to woe. To say “Jesus is accursed” means to speak negatively concerning <span class="pg" data-page-id="511" id="511">[511]</span> Christ. Whenever someone speaks in a negative way about Christ, that is a curse. </p>

<p data-content-id="WPLFJeiDr66zP26-znBSbuxrk_rGZbWayiiy3vwagmclIUlGYx9j371es8KAwySLd"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83167" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1-11">12:1-11</span> Paul stresses two matters: speaking and the Spirit. A Christian must be a speaking person. If we are silent in our worship, then we become dumb worshippers. We do not worship a silent God; we worship a living, speaking God. Thus, our speaking is a sign that we are proper worshippers of God. Furthermore, whenever we speak, Christ should be the center. We should even speak forth the Lord Jesus. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83168" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:3">12:3</span>, when we say, “Lord Jesus,” we are in the Spirit. Therefore, speaking is Paul’s first emphasis in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83169" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1-11">12:1-11</span>, and the Spirit is the second. </p>
<p data-content-id="2x5QcsCAgui9NXQYMVnCg51gf1NTLk96Dzgmah3an8nZifIVz9C609J7eMcjMZTbI"> As Christians, we all should speak. When we speak forth the Lord, we are in the Spirit. For example, as I speak, I breathe in air. I am not only surrounded by the air, but air is also in me. The more I open my mouth to speak, the more the air enters into me and saturates me. If I would neither speak nor breathe, there would be no way for air to come into my being. Then my inner being could not receive the necessary supply of oxygen. In order for oxygen to work in my inward parts, it is necessary for me to breathe and speak. By speaking I enjoy the air. In the same principle, when we speak with Christ as the center of our speaking, we are in the Spirit. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83170" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:12-22">12:12-22</span> he speaks of the Body again and again. Today there is a neglect of the Body among many <span class="pg" data-page-id="520" id="520">[520]</span> Pentecostal people. They may seek the Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit without realizing that the gifts of the Spirit are altogether for the Body. The gifts are of the members, but they are not for the members. Rather, the gifts are of the members and for the Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="ldCSVKCXVHzwbcJAktI5qY9WW0m-zAHEfyRHCaCwzcGvha9kv82E6htYPVBgcHt9H"> We may use the members of our physical body as an illustration of how the gifts are for the Body. My hand has a particular gift and is able to do certain things. But the gift and the functions of the hand are not for the hand itself, but for the body. Likewise, the feet have the ability to walk. We may say that they have the gift of walking. But this ability, this gift, is for the body; it is not only for the feet. In the same principle, our mouth eats for the body, and our eyes see for the body. Would it not be a terrible thing if the mouth ate only for itself and not for the body? If such were the case, the food would remain in the mouth and not be supplied to the body. It would also be dreadful if the eyes functioned only for themselves and did not see for the body. The eyes have a function, the ability to see. This seeing gift, however, though it belongs to the eyes, is not for the eyes; it is for the body. The nose also functions for the body. If the nose could be selfish and keep all the air for itself, the body would not receive air. The nose breathes air for the body. All these illustrations show that the gift that belongs to each member is for the whole body. </p>
<p data-content-id="OT5FVjm4b3rEEp9If2G1UsfkTjficISBMlQujITvH9vLo8q-qnrQL8cvvI2WkbUHd"> We need to be impressed with the fact that immediately after emphasizing the Spirit, Paul turns to the Body and places a great emphasis on it.

All the believers of Christ are organically united with Him and constituted of His life and element to become His Body, an organism, to express Him. Hence, He is not only the Head, but also the Body.

Christ is the life and constituent of this Body, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ. It is in this one Spirit that we were all baptized into this one living Body to express Christ. </p>

Baptism ushers the believers into an organic union with Christ and the Triune God, making them living members of the Body of Christ. All the gifts, as the manifestation of the Spirit distributed to the individual believers by the Spirit, are for the profit, the building up, of this Body. The apostle is very conscious of this. He is very Body-conscious, Body-centered, unlike the Corinthians and so many other believers through the centuries who have been very much self-centered concerning spiritual gifts. Hence, following this verse, Paul gives us a long discourse concerning the Body. His intention is to rescue the Corinthian believers from self-seeking back to a concern for the Body so that they may be no longer for their individual profit, but for the building up of the Body. <span class="pg" data-page-id="522" id="522">[522]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="EKLQNzB20IJMJNZAsXkVbasdhWNIKYBtTmX0sIgDmdSh2KIOAd4oaYB8TBbVW9IBJ"> To be baptized in the Spirit is to get into the Spirit and be lost in Him. To drink the Spirit is to take the Spirit in and have our being saturated with Him. By these two procedures we are mingled with the Spirit. To be baptized in the Spirit is the initiation of the mingling and is once for all. To drink the Spirit is the continuation and accomplishment of the mingling and is perpetual, forever. </p>
<p data-content-id="DeXM5GXdbazrZOx-ax9Rc0jrX8cWBb4GMcXtN6JXJuzK9JlkY0coVF7VTZZGpUzMQ"> Today Pentecostal people talk a great deal about the baptism in the Spirit, but not nearly as much about being baptized into the Body. The baptism of the Spirit is not for individuals; it is for the Body. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83183" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">verse 13</span> Paul clearly says, “In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body.” This Body is an organic entity. We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83184" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83185" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Galatians 3:27</span> that we have been baptized into the Triune God and into Christ. The Triune God and Christ are organic and living. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83186" data-verses="Romans 6:3">Romans 6:3</span> we know that we have been baptized not only into Christ but also into His death. Positively, we have been baptized into the Triune God and into Christ; negatively, we have been baptized into the death of Christ. This negative aspect of baptism clears away such negative things as sin, the flesh, the self, and the old creation. The ultimate issue of baptism is that we are put into the Body. Hallelujah, we are in the Body! </p>

The Tempering of the Members</h2><p data-content-id="b6PkOnBRxPH-JZwYqEGn8CHT8qNMfaW8HfFW_7AUwlEPRETelPUlRIL-iaR1qLEZU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83196" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:23-27">verses 23 through 27</span> Paul speaks regarding the tempering of the members. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83197" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:23-24">Verses 23 and 24</span> say, “And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor, and our uncomely members have more abundant comeliness; but our comely members have no need. But God has tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked.” The Greek word translated tempered literally means blended; hence, mixed, compounded, adjusted. God has blended all the different members of Christ together into one Body. For this we need much transformation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83198" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Rom. 12:2</span>), from the natural life to the spiritual, by the same Spirit, for the practical Body life. </p>
<p data-content-id="qPvGt579Xg2208_F-Y_Px3PmmtBqvIPphcI-pUvjo8q_UxMIXkBSVMp3PZrkIuHbS"> It is not easy to be blended together in the Body. It is even difficult for a husband and wife to be tempered together. In the Body we are blended, tempered, with many others. Furthermore, the Body is both local and universal. If you think you have been blended quite well with the saints in your locality, the Lord may bring someone from another part of the world to test how much you have been tempered. This is the situation of the church in Anaheim. Anaheim is a good example of a church where people of many races and nationalities meet together and experience the blending, the mixing, the compounding. To be compounded is to be adjusted. God has blended, tempered, all the different members of Christ together into one Body. Such tempering requires a <span class="pg" data-page-id="528" id="528">[528]</span> great deal of transformation. For the practical Body life we need to be transformed by the Spirit from the natural life to the spiritual life. </p>
<p data-content-id="yV3PEIgX1GeafzM-ZlWqiZrLTlMVVP6QhXbe0VLd8-szYYywPm2y0AATrFvXenxHw"> God has tempered the Body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacks so “that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83199" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:25">v. 25</span>). In the Body life the same care should be given to all the different members. Difference in care causes divisions. </p>
<p data-content-id="PxQUR1aSfVg1g5EN0uN6GBmA7oa_DRqoDDo2oKF94p-AdYjLrSH1ujpvA-dj4BNGp"> God cannot carry out His administration if the Body is divided. God has one way to carry out His administration in the universe. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83200" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span>, God will head up all things in Christ through the Body of Christ. First Christ must head up the church. Then God will use the Body of Christ headed up by Christ and in Christ to head up all things. The time is coming when all things will be headed up in Christ. This will be the dispensation of the fullness of times. In order for this to take place, God must head us up in Christ. This is the reason the Lord definitely needs His recovery. </p>
<p data-content-id="-31E-FlFhHZVWfRVsibLPN9Po-xOz3xA0N55Vv-NyImqaLANCOsF5aHepDtdpWJmP"> In today’s Christianity, the Body has been divided. Some claim that we are narrow and exclusive. Actually, the situation is the opposite. We are not exclusive, and we are not narrow. We recognize and accept all genuine believers, no matter what their background may be. As long as they are blood-washed, Spirit-regenerated believers in Christ, we receive them. We do not have any creed, any particular belief, or any special terms or conditions. We simply believe the Bible in a general way. This gives God an opportunity to gather a remnant of those who love Him and seek Him and use them to recover the proper church life. God is using the church life in the Lord’s recovery as a testimony of the oneness in the midst of the divisions. </p>
<p data-content-id="prVBOIVQEyCQk7WbC65wKBFpZIyHUt92rL6Jiga3N6sMf93hlzv0FeRHAEKBhJS-J"> We strongly testify that we reject all divisive factors. An example of such a factor would be insisting on a certain form of baptism. Although we practice pray-reading, we do not allow pray-reading to become a factor of division. If those attending the meetings do not want to pray-read, we do not <span class="pg" data-page-id="529" id="529">[529]</span> insist that they do so. The matter of tongues is not a factor of division among us. Because we reject all factors of division, the Lord has a way to gain a remnant to replace the divisions so that God can carry out His administration. </p>
<p data-content-id="vFgafReeId0NLp6vSzTQo14EsX_DOCFdySvaNp4gGNBc9CrkwduxPEplaAWErKNdi"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83201" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:3-11">verses 3 through 11</span> Paul mentions the Spirit again and again. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83202" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:12-27">verses 12 through 27</span> he makes no mention of the Spirit, but uses the word body eighteen times. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83203" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">verse 13</span> we have the transition from the Spirit to the Body: “For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.” In one Spirit we have all been baptized into one Body. Many Pentecostal people, however, talk only of being baptized in the Spirit. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83204" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">verse 13</span> says that in one Spirit we have been baptized into one Body to drink one Spirit. It is crucial to realize that we have been baptized into one Body to drink. Not only have we been baptized in one Spirit; we have also been baptized into one Body and with a particular purpose—to drink one Spirit. In the recovery we emphasize very strongly the matter of being in the one Body drinking one Spirit. Are you now in the Body drinking? I can declare boldly that I am in the one Body drinking the one Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="WPLFJeiDr66zP26-znBSbuxrk_rGZbWayiyyw8QagmclIUlGYx9j371es8KAwySLd"> To be baptized in the one Body is to experience something once for all. But to drink one Spirit is a continuing experience. We may compare baptism to a wedding, and drinking to married life. The real experience of married life does not take place at the wedding. The wedding is a procedure to acknowledge the fact of marriage. But the experience of married life continues day by day. The same is true of baptism and drinking. Many Christians have only the “wedding”—baptism; they do not have the “married life”—the daily drinking of one Spirit. In the Lord’s recovery we have both baptism and drinking, both the wedding and the daily married life. We have the procedure to receive and accept the fact, and we have the moment-by-moment experience. Now we are in the Body to drink. In one Spirit we have all been baptized. Now I am happy to say that we are in the Body drinking. How wonderful to be drinking the Spirit in <span class="pg" data-page-id="530" id="530">[530]</span> the Body! Sometimes I enjoy this drinking so much that I am excited and beside myself with joy. </p>
<p data-content-id="2x5QcsCAgui9NXQYMVnCg51gf1NTLk96DzwmcyHan8nZifIVz9C609J7eMcjMZTbI"> After making the transfer from the Spirit to the Body in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83205" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">verse 13</span>, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83206" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:14-27">verses 14 through 27</span> Paul talks about the body with the members. Here we see that Paul is centered on the Body and burdened regarding the Body. The spiritual gifts are a matter not only of the Spirit, but also a matter for the Body. These gifts are of the Spirit and by the Spirit, but they are not for us as individuals. The gifts are for the Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="uEOnd0iMx5POKDetv2t0ZpmBAFDGOo1C5nZS1JDWbwDZZmpB_EzDqM1j3iDcpaIYK"> Throughout the years I have known a number of brothers and sisters who, humanly speaking, do not seem to have any gifts. But they have a strong spirit with a heart for the Body. As a result, eventually they have been much used by the Lord. I know of a certain couple who have been visited by the Lord’s mercy. They received His grace, and they began to love Him. Gradually, over the years, they have been growing in the Body and have received a burden for the Body. The only gift they seem to have is that of loving the Body, of loving the saints. Now in their locality there is a beautiful expression of the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="fonV3HEy2MU2N2I0YaxDvgIBiUxgNE7RShzm89oXAqnMbBjw-ecpzlsiH3gTPoymz"> However, those who are talented by birth, gifted by rebirth, and well educated may not be useful at all in the raising up of the proper church life. Instead, they may not use their gifts for the Body, but for themselves. But the couple I have just referred to is in the Body and cares for the Body. For this reason, the Lord has used them in the raising up of a local church. If this brother and sister continue to receive grace and be preserved in grace, their function, their gift, will be enriched, uplifted, and multiplied. However, those who are talented, gifted, educated, and eloquent may cause problems and eventually even cause divisions. </p>
<p data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp-lflbjQrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen"> Today’s charismatic movement seems to be quite prevailing. However, it is also very divided. Furthermore, it does not help believers to grow in life. The charismatic movement is of an altogether different category from the Lord’s recovery. </p>
<p data-content-id="HGln5zZ0kg7BRF2G3k4ch5kayK9fIchfJ74VVhfWdxC7j7vo-3Hmf4N_nWwoJM4tK"> It is important for us to see that concerning the gifts Paul places great emphasis on the Body. We must be in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="531" id="531">[531]</span> Body, we must be for the Body, and we must be thoroughly Body-conscious and Body-centered. If we are Body-conscious and Body-centered, we shall be used by the Lord. </p>

And yet I show to you a way of excellence.” The way of excellence is love. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83237" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> presents this excellent way. </p>

Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83239" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> we have love as the fifth emphasis. Speaking ushers us into the Spirit, the Spirit brings us into the Body, and the Body preserves us in the Spirit. Furthermore, the Body is for God’s administration. Paul’s fifth emphasis, the matter of love, is the way to use the gifts, the way to be in the Body, and the way to be for the Body. </p>

Rather, it comes between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83241" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapters twelve</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83242" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">fourteen</span> and with them forms a portion in this Epistle dealing with the gifts. Therefore, we should never consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83243" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> as if it stood by itself. No, it is a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83244" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapter twelve</span> and leads into <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83245" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>. The first verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83246" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> indicates this: “Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.” The last verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83247" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:31">chapter twelve</span> brings us into <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83248" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>, and the first verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83249" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> concludes <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83250" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> and brings us into <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83251" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83252" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:31">12:31</span> Paul speaks of the excellent way to exercise the gifts, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83253" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> he presents love as this excellent way, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83254" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">14:1</span> he advises us to pursue love and desire <span class="pg" data-page-id="536" id="536">[536]</span> earnestly the spiritual gifts, especially that we may prophesy. Thus, these chapters make up one unit, with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83255" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> continuing <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83256" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapter twelve</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83257" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> continuing <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83258" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="K9Fhzhq9ETFPCPzdkFWRrkfkDyu0qmgItxi5kxf0zVrET7fYv2qxzXlZDmd0Kk9SX"> Is love only a way, or is it also a gift? According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83259" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span>, there is ground to say that love is a gift. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83260" data-verses="Romans 12:6-8">Romans 12:6-8</span> Paul says that we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us and that we should exercise them accordingly. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83261" data-verses="Romans 12:8">verse 8</span>, even the showing of mercy is a gift. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83262" data-verses="Romans 12:9-10">verses 9 and 10</span> Paul goes on to say, “Let love be without hypocrisy....Love one another warmly in brotherly love, vying with one another in showing honor.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83263" data-verses="Romans 12:12-13">verses 12 and 13</span> he says, “Rejoicing in hope, enduring in tribulation, persevering in prayer, communicating to the needs of the saints, pursuing hospitality.” All these, along with love, are spoken of in a chapter concerned with gifts. Therefore, we may say that love is at least on the border of the gifts. </p>
<p data-content-id="EKLQNzB20IJMJNZAsXkVbasdhWNIKYBtQkX0sKgDmdSh2KIOAd4oaYB8TBbVW9IBJ"> Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83264" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:8">1 Corinthians 13:8</span> may also indicate that love is a gift and not merely a way: “Love never falls away; but whether prophecies, they shall be done away; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall be done away.” Here Paul lists love along with the gifts of prophecy, tongues, and knowledge. There is no doubt that to prophesy, speak in tongues, and teach with the word of knowledge are gifts. Although prophecies will be done away, tongues will cease, and knowledge will be done away, love will never fall away. </p>
<p data-content-id="DeXM5GXdbazrZOx-ax9Rc0jrX8cWBb4GPeXtN4JXJuzK9JlkY0coVF7VTZZGpUzMQ"> I have pointed out that there are certain brothers and sisters who apparently do not have any gifts. However, they are absolutely for the Body. To be for the Body is a matter of love, and to care for the members of the Body requires love. If we do not have love, how can we care for others? Love is necessary to care for the members so that the Body may be built up. Thus, love is the greatest gift. Nothing edifies people as much as love does. Love is a spiritual antibiotic. If there is love in a local church, there will be no need to worry <span class="pg" data-page-id="537" id="537">[537]</span> about spiritual diseases. Love is the best medicine to cure such diseases. Love is a gift, even the greatest gift. </p>
<p data-content-id="S4UBTaDBLhflHNtSeJetHIxvSeWeK0YxcM1FUh7ZupcAWEz0O3GGyaxAZbn0GYdQO"> It is not difficult to have the gift of love. There is no need to fast for love or pray to receive it. Furthermore, there is no need to imitate, pretend, or perform. Love is within us. As long as you have the divine life through regeneration, you also have love, for love is the expression of life, another form of life. </p>

<p data-content-id="5cvwE7fG0BCj-rNo6NGmlSxcfn8js06QFIyHjAiKtAHd3P8c8SI8FsHkl6iaraK0i"> Paul takes a whole chapter to emphasize the crucial matter of love. His first emphasis, on speaking, occupies just three verses; his second emphasis, on the Spirit, occupies nine or ten verses; and the third and fourth matter he emphasizes, the Body and administration, occupy sixteen verses and three verses respectively. But when Paul comes to the crucial matter of love, he devotes an entire chapter to it. This shows how important love is. </p>
<p data-content-id="N9DQWvp40eBT2VybP3ap72SyWkeUtkAvgCvyCRS_h8YrqVB4HFvlImtcJ6D_lT9Tg"> Love is a matter of life. Certain gifts are also related to life, for they are developed from the initial gifts: the Holy Spirit and the divine life. However, other gifts, especially miraculous gifts such as speaking in tongues, interpretation of tongues, works of power or miracles, and healings, are not developed out of life. For this reason, Paul opens <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83265" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> by saying, “If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.” Sounding brass and clanging cymbals give sounds without life. This is a genuine illustration of tongue-speaking. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83266" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapters twelve</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83267" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">fourteen</span> Paul places tongues and interpretation of tongues last. But here he mentions tongue-speaking first, but in a negative way that indicates that it is not a matter of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="tiNQgxDpsd4NWazI4KY7Ls3Zc1jf31TN5nm0onJv7jbyJhqTUCAeHZ8B89sG6uKJy"> In the same principle, divine healing may not be a matter of life. There is a healing which comes by gift and a healing which comes by grace. This latter kind is of life, even of resurrection life. During my Christian life I have experienced the gift of healing. But I wish to testify that many times I <span class="pg" data-page-id="538" id="538">[538]</span> have enjoyed healing by grace. For two and a half years, from September, 1943, until the spring of 1946, I was seriously ill with tuberculosis. For many months I was confined to bed. Every day I prayed to the Lord and was dealt with by Him. I did not pray for the church or for the work, but for my own situation. Eventually what mattered most was not that I would be healed, but that I would be thoroughly cleansed and purified. I can testify that during that period of time, my motives, intentions, and every part of my inner being were dealt with. Then the Lord healed me not by a gift in power, but by grace in life. That healing was thorough and absolute. I draw on my experience to point out that to receive healing by means of a gift has nothing to do with life. However, there is a healing by grace in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="h8T7ZUYpMcEVtTeTw4Ei-WaWWau_ZtkWF1Z7SjFWsI31mZB3IXYJad2ffrJvNMmVr"> I appreciate the gifts in life much more than the miraculous gifts. I have seen some believers who genuinely received certain miraculous gifts only to later turn from the Lord in unbelief. What we need is life and love, the best gift, which ministers life to others. </p>
<p data-content-id="UF3NSi3eZh7Dl_ZC3t8J3SGQLMJgBmML5xw7n62jfdnUmnLxDxMDWGNZfNU2kahGc"> As those who love the Lord, who are absolute with Him, and who are seeking the building of His Body so that He may have the instrument to carry out God’s administration on earth for the accomplishment of God’s eternal purpose, we must pursue love. Elders and co-workers, you need love. Brothers and sisters, you all need love. Only love builds up the Body. Moreover, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83268" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>, the gift of love is everlasting, for it is constituted of the divine life and is the expression of God, the expression of eternal life. Therefore, we all should pursue love. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mdwix_GaOy3SQn0ueCAHqoNdP1UMTDSJJzKRUvBvWkxI-OJG9yVXJjndZOAKNjsqN"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83269" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:2-3">13:2 and 3</span> Paul says, “And if I have prophecy and know all the mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. And if I dole out all my goods, and if I deliver up my body that I may boast, but have not love, it profits me nothing.” To deliver up the body in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83270" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:3">verse 3</span> is to die as a martyr. Instead of “that I may boast,” some manuscripts read “that I may be burned.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="539" id="539">[539]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="c72SBDvLnZO0HTNpK_Y1vJj4uYnRW9aV0I2G8_uhmUkJUykeLnr0FNqIv6PWDSSzw"> As Paul was writing <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83304" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapters twelve</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83305" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">thirteen</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83306" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">fourteen</span> of 1 Corinthians, there was a burden in his spirit and on his heart concerning certain crucial matters: speaking, the Spirit, the Body, God’s administration, and love. These five matters are emphasized in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83307" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapters twelve</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83308" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">thirteen</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83309" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> Paul comes to another main point: the superiority of a particular gift for the building up of the church. Among the many spiritual gifts, one is superior not for our work, maturity, or spiritual interests, but for the building up of the church. As we shall see, this superior gift is that of prophesying. Therefore, in dealing with the gifts, Paul emphasizes six matters: speaking, the Spirit, the Body, the administration of God, love, and the gift which is superior for the building up of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="YAf-ThL_BpKj4Bal8Hh8S_ZBAgDwrplD6feUEWc4sdE5fnGiiRPa9o6wxsU4R57wn"> Paul’s ultimate concern is not speaking, the Spirit, the Body, God’s administration, or love as the excellent way to exercise the gifts. Rather, Paul’s ultimate concern is the building up of the church. Paul was very church-conscious and church-centered. His concern was focused on the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="EKLQNzB20IJMJNZAsXkVbasdhWNIKYBtQkH0lYADmdSh2KIOAd4oaYB8TBbVW9IBJ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83310" data-verses="Colossians 1:24">Colossians 1:24</span> Paul says, “Now I rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church.” Christ died not only for redemption, but also for the church. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83311" data-verses="Ephesians 5:25">Ephesians 5:25</span>, Christ gave Himself up for the church. Yes, Christ died to accomplish redemption. Redemption, however, is a procedure; it is not <span class="pg" data-page-id="544" id="544">[544]</span> God’s goal, God’s destination. Redemption is a way to reach the goal, but the goal is the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="DeXM5GXdbazrZOx-ax9Rc0jrX8cWBb4GPeHtFq5XJuzK9JlkY0coVF7VTZZGpUzMQ"> Because the church is God’s goal, we cannot agree with those Christians who neglect the church and who have only a superficial grasp of Christ’s redemption. Many do not even like to hear the church mentioned. But the death of Christ mainly and ultimately is for the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp9nflbhQrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen"> In eternity we were chosen and predestinated by God. Because we fell away from God, there was the need for Christ to accomplish redemption in order to bring us back to God. But redemption is not God’s goal; it is not His ultimate intention. God’s goal, His intention, is to have His chosen people organically united to be the Body, the church. Even if we had not fallen, it nevertheless would have been necessary for God to carry out a certain procedure to obtain the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="HGln5zZ0kg7BRF2G3k4ch5kayK9fIchfK54VVjfWdxC7j7vo-3Hmf4N_nWwoJM4tK"> When I was young, I was told simply that Christ came because we had fallen into sin. I was taught that God loved us and gave His only begotten Son to save us. According to this understanding, if we had not fallen, it would not have been necessary for Christ to come. But it is a mistake to think that God’s intention is merely to redeem us from hell to heaven. God’s intention is to have the church, and the death of Christ redeems us so that we may become His Body. This was the reason Paul was church-conscious and church-centered. In his consciousness the church was an extremely crucial matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="XfZ84nrEImIc-Nz7b9qjdkNeXbVUzpA1pTstLTvDe1z-Kgbse9Vggac7oUtrY8Ta8"> As we consider the spiritual gifts, we need to ask what the gifts are for. Many Christians care only for the gifts, but they do not care for the purpose of the gifts. Some desire to have a gift of preaching, and others desire the miraculous gifts such as the gift of tongue-speaking or the gift of healing. But they may not care at all what these gifts are for. Paul was different. The concern deep within him was for the building up of the church. He knew what gifts were useful for the building up of the church. We need to learn of Paul to be concerned for the building up of the church. Whether we are spiritual, mature, or gifted is secondary. The primary thing in God’s economy is the building up of the church. <span class="pg" data-page-id="545" id="545">[545]</span> Paul’s emphasis, his main point, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83312" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> concerns what gift is best, not for us, but for the building up of the church. Yes, God has given many gifts, but not all gifts are important with respect to the building up of the church. Therefore, in this chapter Paul shows us which gift is superior for the building up of the church. </p>

To pursue love is to seek after the growth in life for the development of the gifts in life. Hence, it must be matched with an earnest desire for the most profitable gift, the gift of prophecy. </p>
<p data-content-id="b6PkOnBRxPH-JZwYqEGn8CHT8qNMfaW8EdFW5oQUwlEPRETelPUlRIL-iaR1qLEZU"> Paul was very wise, and he composed <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83315" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">verse 1</span> in a wise manner. In this verse he was not actually encouraging the Corinthians to seek such gifts as healing, miracles, and tongue-speaking. Instead, Paul’s intention was that they would seek the gift of prophecy. However, Paul did not tell the Corinthians to forget all the spiritual gifts except the gift of prophecy. He told them to desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather, or especially, that they would prophesy. He wanted them to pursue what was best, what was most valuable. He knew that there was turmoil among the Corinthians and that they needed to be calmed down. For this reason, he exercised wisdom, telling them that love is the best way to exercise the gifts and then charging them to pursue love and desire spiritual gifts, but especially that they may prophesy. </p>
<p data-content-id="qPvGt579Xg2208_F-Y_Px3PmmtBqvIPpieI-gEPjo8q_UxMIXkBSVMp3PZrkIuHbS"> Since to prophesy is to speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord, that is, to minister Christ to others, which is the main thing in the church meeting, prophesying requires <span class="pg" data-page-id="546" id="546">[546]</span> the divine life to fill it as its content. Love is the excellent way to experience the divine life and make it the content of the gift of prophecy for the building up of the church. Hence, we must pursue love and desire earnestly these greater gifts. </p>

But he who prophesies speaks to men for building up and encouragement and consolation.” The apostle’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83317" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:2-6">verses 2 through 6</span> gives a clear and definite view that speaking in tongues is much less important than prophesying. He strongly belittles the gift of tongues and exalts the gift of prophecy because his main concern is the church, not the individual believers. Speaking in tongues, even if it is genuine and proper, only edifies the speaker himself, but prophesying builds up the church. To prophesy in revelation or to teach in knowledge with clear, understandable words is more profitable to the church than to speak in tongues with unknown words. Since to prophesy, to speak forth the Lord, ministers Christ to others, it builds them up and gives them encouragement and consolation. </p>
<p data-content-id="0lPdjYmGFHiI5J5XxCYQsri-H6UWaL3fVaomTnpY3_7MOfbRgf2qmCmeLk8UjNCJ1"> I would like to emphasize the fact that in the New Testament to prophesy is not mainly to predict, but mainly to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord. Even in the books of Isaiah and Jeremiah prophesying is not mainly a matter of prediction, but of speaking for God and of speaking God forth. Of course, the element of prediction is included. Throughout the Bible, to prophesy means to speak for God and to speak forth God and, in a secondary way, to predict. To prophesy is to tell for, to tell forth, and also to foretell. This is a proper understanding of prophecy in the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="7UhQ1h6ietnCG3iSYMQGeKol8eEauxoK22uSGHIQc6bIZTcaCCwQEPzHoI6-oWcib"> To prophesy in the sense of telling for and telling forth requires much growth in life. For this, we need to know God and we need to experience Christ. If we do not have the <span class="pg" data-page-id="547" id="547">[547]</span> adequate knowledge of God and experience of Christ, we do not have anything to say for Him, and we cannot speak Him forth. To prophesy in the sense of foretelling, of predicting something before it happens, is miraculous and does not require the growth in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PQd6AGHMk6jAgPz44nxU9j8ur2zdeZuy_02gW1AEy7EqNuVxyNwhicQJPFxcqffg"> To repeat, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83318" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">1 Corinthians 12</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83319" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">14</span> the noun prophecy and the verb prophesy do not mainly refer to prediction; they mainly denote speaking for God and speaking forth God. Nevertheless, many of those in today’s Pentecostalism or charismatic movement place great emphasis on the element of prediction and neglect the more important matters of speaking for God and speaking God forth. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83367" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapter twelve</span> Paul speaks of the Body again and again, at least eighteen times. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83368" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> he speaks of the building up of the church. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83369" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapter twelve</span> we have the Body and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83370" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>, the church. </p>

The Body is the church, and the church is the Body. Nevertheless, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83371" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapter twelve</span> Paul emphasizes the Body, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83372" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> he emphasizes the church. There is a distinction between the Body and the church. The Body is an organism for Christ as the believers’ life to grow and express Himself. The church is an assembly for God to operate His administration. Christ as life is the essence of the Body as an organic entity. This organism is not for organization; it is for living to express Christ. Christ is the essence of His Body, and His Body is an organic entity which lives, grows, and matures with Himself until it eventually expresses Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="556" id="556">[556]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="h8T7ZUYpMcEVtTeTw4Ei-WaWWau_ZtkWF157ShFWsI31mZB3IXYJad2ffrJvNMmVr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83373" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:12-27">12:12-27</span> the main thought is not activity or enterprise. It is that the Body is an organism to live, grow, mature, and express Christ as the inward essence. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83374" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:3">verse 3</span> tells us that when we say, “Lord Jesus,” we are in the Spirit. It is the Spirit who brings us into the Body, for the Spirit is the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, not merely the Spirit of God as found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83375" data-verses="Genesis 1:3">Genesis 1:3</span>. We have received the Spirit who brings us into the Body organically. </p>
<p data-content-id="UF3NSi3eZh7Dl_ZC3t8J3SGQLMJgBmML5xQ7n42jfdnUmnLxDxMDWGNZfNU2kahGc"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83376" data-verses="Romans 10:13">Romans 10:13</span> Paul says, “Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” We need to put this verse together with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83377" data-verses="Acts 2:21">Acts 2:21</span>: “And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.” Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83378" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span> to be saved is to receive the initial gifts of the Spirit. To receive the Spirit as the initial gift is equal to being saved. This takes place not only by believing, but also by calling on the Lord. Everyone who truly believes in the Lord Jesus will also call on Him and say, “Lord Jesus.” If we say, “Lord Jesus,” the Spirit will come into us, and we shall be in the Spirit. The Spirit is the <em>pneuma,</em> the breath, the air, for us to breathe. It is impossible for us to breathe without taking air into us. When we breathe, the air is in us, and we are in the air. Likewise, when we call on the Lord Jesus, we are in the Spirit who gives life and brings us into the Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mdwix_GaOy3SQn0ueCAHqoNdP1UMTDSJJzqRXvhvWkxI-OJG9yVXJjndZOAKNjsqN"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83379" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">12:13</span>, in the Spirit we have been baptized into the Body. The water of baptism is a symbol of the fact that we have been baptized into the Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83380" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matt. 28:19</span>) and baptized into Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83381" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Gal. 3:27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83382" data-verses="Romans 6:3">Rom. 6:3</span>).

Hallelujah, we are now in the Body! We have called, “Lord Jesus,” and have been brought into the Spirit, the Spirit has ushered us into the Body, and now we are organically in the Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="VAmSFImgVrwWBDh3eU1j3ZFZPnAW6HkY_JeA_aJXxzEgwGujPfsebgBAiBEiWFZI6"> After speaking so much concerning the Body in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83384" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:12-27">12:12-27</span>, Paul begins to speak of the church in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83385" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:28">verse 28</span>: “And God has placed some in the church: firstly apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers; then works of power, then gifts of <span class="pg" data-page-id="557" id="557">[557]</span> healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.” The church is for God’s administration. When Paul mentions the church, his emphasis is not on an organic entity, but on God’s administration. The Body is for the expression of Christ; the church is for the administration of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83386" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> Paul’s concept is not mainly related to organic growth, but to governmental administration. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83387" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapter twelve</span> the emphasis is on life; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83388" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> it is on government. Therefore, we may use the term “organic expression” to describe <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83389" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapter twelve</span> and the term “governmental administration” to describe <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83390" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>. Furthermore, the building up of the church is for administration, but the building up of the Body is for the expression of Christ organically. To express Christ we need the Body; to carry out the divine administration we need the church. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83391" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">chapter twelve</span> emphasizes the Body organically for growth and the expression of Christ, but <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83392" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> emphasizes the church governmentally for the carrying out of God’s eternal purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="imdufFGU1VpsTYYg4sAVUG-TWWELatFvTms3HIW7L7B-Rv1HfZsOuLeAEkuDTcJUK"> At this point I would ask a question related to speaking in tongues: For the Body to grow organically and express Christ, can tongue-speaking ever be helpful? We need to answer this question carefully. It would be wrong to say that tongue-speaking could not be of any help to the growth of the Body. Speaking in tongues is somewhat related to the Spirit, and the Spirit is for the Body. For this reason, we should not say that tongue-speaking could never be helpful to the Body. The decisive factor concerns our realization regarding tongue-speaking and our application of it. If you apply tongue-speaking only for your self-seeking, this will damage the Body. But if you seek tongue-speaking for the Body and if you take care of the Body, then your tongue-speaking will be helpful to the Body. Some among us have testified that tongue-speaking stirred them inwardly to seek Christ. This is a fact which cannot be denied. Certainly to seek Christ is by the Spirit and for the Body. However, those who are stirred up by the Spirit through tongue-speaking to seek Christ may not realize that their seeking of Christ should <span class="pg" data-page-id="558" id="558">[558]</span> be for the Body. In such a case, their realization regarding tongue-speaking is somewhat short. For tongue-speaking to be helpful to the Body depends on the proper realization and application. </p>
<p data-content-id="1mtnlxhyi5vxsNUaDN97plJIxKXrOz7lWoPX_h2zO2SmNPZ4cC3ocFDiy4eTOiBly"> Now let me ask another question: Is tongue-speaking helpful in the building up of the church for God’s administration? The answer to this question is a clear and definite no. Especially as practiced today, tongue-speaking is of no help to God’s administration. On the contrary, in case after case it damages the church, tears down God’s administration, and overthrows the divine government. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9eaN6Fdd37GIAwbbB4iu5JzKVZeyCcOvfuBTi4ngEMpuLpI4URJ1klC1LrBzVosWL">THE WRITINGS OF PAUL AND JOHN</h2><p data-content-id="jfI-61Rh_EbH_IA1gDUEXyzj4P3_cZ1Wo_gVQ0OJ9jg9A32Kw2FtbNOlkIQAhHCHk"> First Corinthians was written in Ephesus. In writing this Epistle Paul’s intention was to correct and adjust the church in Corinth. That church was in confusion, both in the Christian life and in relation to God’s administration. Paul’s intention was to regulate the Corinthians, rescue them from their distractions, and bring them back to the central lane of God’s economy. When Paul wrote this Epistle, he was enjoying the excellent church life in Ephesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="TgPV7WYzePxLg1dlN-g0NWu5ni7DunVUy3j8prU42YLj5QKtSQNXUKE8xxgPy_6YT"> The book of Romans was written in Corinth. After writing 1 Corinthians, Paul eventually left Ephesus and visited Corinth. As he says in 2 Corinthians, he delayed coming to them because he wanted to spare them and did not want to come in sorrow. But because they repented and were adjusted after receiving his first Epistle, Paul was happy and went to Corinth to see them. While he was in Corinth, he wrote the Epistle to the Romans. </p>
<p data-content-id="nHflLWyF2nFg6U3Z-4mUTN0kfws3Baz2HRpbi3FTEzR-CESxOjvQhJ575ytY-yo5S"> Romans is a basic sketch, a governing sketch, of the Christian life and the church life. In this book Paul does not say a word about tongue-speaking or divine healing. He knew from his experience in Corinth how much the church had been damaged by tongue-speaking and by the so-called miraculous healing. At the time, Corinth was a hotbed for such things. Many were extremely enthusiastic about tongue-speaking and ecstatic over the miraculous things. Nevertheless, by these very things the church was ruined, <span class="pg" data-page-id="559" id="559">[559]</span> destroyed. Realizing the damage this had caused to the church in Corinth, Paul was very sober when he wrote the book of Romans. </p>
<p data-content-id="6nl9vMoAoMK12zKD0K5y_Gx6eSA-VnhwxUgnBKfa_w2PSkAV7X6WzBuN8UC31SJbX"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83393" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span> Paul speaks of the function of the proper gifts in the Lord’s Body. I repeat, here Paul does not say a word concerning tongue-speaking or divine healing. Rather, he stresses having mercy, loving one another, and pursuing hospitality. This indicates that Paul took the lead to belittle tongue-speaking. Paul’s attitude in his completing ministry toward speaking in tongues is to belittle it. </p>

<p data-content-id="6nl9vMoAoMK12zKD0K5y_Gx6eSA-VnhwxUwnFY_a_w2PSkAV7X6WzBuN8UC31SJbX"> Throughout the years much has been spoken and written concerning <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83403" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:26-40">14:26-40</span>. The reason for this is that in the New Testament there is not a clear word telling us how Christians should meet or how we should function in the meetings of the church. This portion of 1 Corinthians is considered by some to be unique in the New Testament in that it seems to tell us how to function in the meetings. However, the more we study these verses, the more puzzled we become. But because Paul has included this section in 1 Corinthians, we need to study it carefully. </p>
<p data-content-id="RKpt0z8nFNlHi_3vAHu8OcgGgYOj-shs-G-Sw9LEU8dkYiKR-u6Z0ZA1R2xXn3ai4"> In the Recovery Version of 1 Corinthians, the subtitle for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83404" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:26-40">14:26-40</span> is, “How to Function in the Church Meeting.” Actually, I do not like the term “how to.” The New Testament is the word of the Spirit, not a word of “how to” do things. The human mind always desires to know how to do a particular thing. This desire is somewhat natural. Nevertheless, it is sometimes impossible to keep from using the term “how to.” Therefore, I have used it as a subtitle for this portion of 1 Corinthians. </p>

<p data-content-id="qPvGt579Xg2208_F-Y_Px3PmmtBqvIPpieo-gGPjo8q_UxMIXkBSVMp3PZrkIuHbS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83405" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:26">verse 26</span> Paul says, “What is it then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.” “Has,” used five times in this verse, is the translation of the Greek word <em>echo,</em> <span class="pg" data-page-id="564" id="564">[564]</span> a word widely used, with many meanings, three of which are the main ones: (1) to hold, to possess, to keep a certain thing; (2) to have a certain thing for enjoyment; (3) to have the means or power to do a thing. The first two meanings should be applied to the first three of the five things listed in this verse—a psalm, a teaching, a revelation—and the third meaning to the last two—a tongue and an interpretation of a tongue. This indicates that when we come to the church meeting, we should have something of the Lord to share with others, whether a psalm to praise the Lord, a teaching (of the teacher) to minister the riches of Christ to edify and nourish others, a revelation (of the prophet, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83406" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:30">v. 30</span>) to give visions of God’s eternal purpose concerning Christ as God’s mystery and the church as Christ’s mystery, a tongue as a sign to the unbelievers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83407" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:22">v. 22</span>) that they may know and accept Christ, or an interpretation to make a tongue concerning Christ and His Body understandable. Before coming to the meeting, we should prepare ourselves for the meeting with things like these from the Lord and of the Lord, either through our experience of Him or through our enjoyment of His Word and fellowship with Him in prayer. After coming into the meeting, we should not wait for an inspiration; there is no need to wait. We should exercise our spirit and use our trained mind to function in presenting what we have been prepared with to the Lord for His glory and satisfaction and to the attendants for their benefit—enlightening, nourishing, and building up. </p>
<p data-content-id="yV3PEIgX1GeafzM-ZlWqiZrLTlMVVP6QiV7e8H7d8-szYYywPm2y0AATrFvXenxHw"> This is like the feast of tabernacles in ancient times: the children of Israel brought the produce of the good land, which they reaped from their labor on the land, to the feast and offered it to the Lord for His enjoyment and for mutual participation in fellowship with the Lord and with one another. We must labor on Christ, our good land, that we may reap some produce of His riches to bring to the church meeting to offer. Thus, the church meeting will be an exhibition of Christ in His riches and a mutual enjoyment of Christ shared by all the attendants with one another before <span class="pg" data-page-id="565" id="565">[565]</span> God and with God for the building up of the saints and the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="8mSjN8Zzt62gkGo0MycXHksy-YBKtJWbf4Jv2PyOa49_JwqOmHn6fmadytYtxsWL6"> According to the stress and emphasis of this Epistle, all five things listed in this verse should be focused on Christ as God’s center for our portion and the church as God’s goal for our aim. The psalm should be the praise of God for giving Christ as wisdom and power to us for our daily life and church life. The teaching from a teacher and the revelation from a prophet should teach and minister Christ with the church as His Body to others. A tongue and its interpretation should also have Christ with the church as its center and content. Any emphasis on things other than Christ and the church will confuse and distract the church from the central lane of God’s New Testament economy and make the church like that in Corinth. </p>
<p data-content-id="0lPdjYmGFHiI5J5XxCYQsri-H6UWaL3fVaImQnJY3_7MOfbRgf2qmCmeLk8UjNCJ1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83408" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:26">verse 26</span> Paul tells us that everything should be done for building up. Whatever we do in the church meeting must be for the building up of the saints and the church. To exhibit Christ and to enjoy Him in our meetings for the building up of His body must be our unique purpose and goal. </p>
<p data-content-id="7UhQ1h6ietnCG3iSYMQGeKol8eEauxoK22OSFGoQc6bIZTcaCCwQEPzHoI6-oWcib"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83409" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:26">verse 26</span> the word “has” is very important. According to Paul, whenever we all come together to meet, we should have something. Paul does not say “shall have” or “should have”; he speaks in the present tense to denote the fact and says that we have something, that each one of us has something. Furthermore, he does not say that just a few have, that many have, or that most have; he says that “each one has” something. He then mentions five things in the following sequence: a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, an interpretation. This list is not all-inclusive; it is illustrative. He mentions a psalm first, and tongues and interpretation last. He lists tongues and interpretation last because in this chapter he is mindful of the building up of the church for God’s administration. </p>
<p data-content-id="_PQd6AGHMk6jAgPz44nxU9j8ur2zdeZuy_U2jXVAEy7EqNuVxyNwhicQJPFxcqffg"> The fact that Paul mentions a psalm first indicates that in the meeting of the church praising the Lord must be primary. A psalm is somewhat equivalent to a hymn. In today’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="566" id="566">[566]</span> Pentecostal movement there is the singing of Bible verses. However, most of the verses are from the Old Testament. I doubt if there has ever been singing concerning Christ as the mystery of God or the church as the mystery of Christ. Have you ever heard that those in a Pentecostal meeting sang <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83410" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83411" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">3</span>, or <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83412" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">4</span>? We need to write music that we may sing these chapters and other portions of the books which make up the heart of the divine revelation: Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. We need to sing about how it pleased God to reveal His Son in us; about Christ living in us and about the fact that we have been crucified with Him; about walking in the Spirit and according to the regulation of the Spirit; about the need for a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that we may know the hope of God’s calling, the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and the greatness of His power exercised to raise Christ and set Him in the heavens; about the church being the fullness of Christ, the One who fills all in all; about the need to be strengthened into our inner man by the Spirit of God with might so that Christ may make His home in our hearts and that we may comprehend with all the saints the universal dimensions of Christ unto the fullness of God; about one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father of all; about walking in the truth of Jesus so that we may put off the old man, put on the new man, and be renewed in the spirit of our mind to have the reality of the new man; about the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ; about magnifying Christ, living Him, being found in Him, pursuing Him, and having the excellent knowledge of Him; about Christ, the Beloved, as the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of creation. Let us learn to sing verses from these four books as well as from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83413" data-verses="Romans 1:1-2">Romans, 1 and 2</span> Corinthians, and Hebrews. In our singing we need to be brought up to the standard of the New Testament economy. </p>

<p data-content-id="CFF3xQmaFvwJ5j4xk2Wr_M9AHisFFvvZCxojl81hhQwaE4qISeDhS6DHqSHn3a8XL"> At the beginning of the church age, the saints were very simple. They did not yet have the New Testament, and very few had copies of the Old Testament. Furthermore, they did not have hymn books. However, one thing is certain: they all had the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. In the early days of the church life, there were not so many doctrines, practices, or ways to work for the Lord. Instead, the saints simply enjoyed the Spirit who lived and dwelt in their spirit. This made them a different kind of people. Before they were saved, they were in the condition described by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83469" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1-3">Ephesians 2:1-3</span>. But after they were saved, converted, and regenerated, they became another kind of people, a people indwelt by the all-inclusive Spirit. </p>

This practice of calling on the name of the Lord Jesus was the sign of a believer in Christ. The unbelievers could easily recognize a Christian by the fact that he called on the Lord’s name. I have no doubt that the early Christians daily called upon the name of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="prVBOIVQEyCQk7WbC65wKBFpZIyHUt92oIqJrya3N6sMf93hlzv0FeRHAEKBhJS-J"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83471" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1:2</span> Paul refers to this matter: “To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and <span class="pg" data-page-id="576" id="576">[576]</span> ours.” This verse indicates that, on the one hand, the believers are a called people, for they have been called by God. On the other hand, they are a calling people, for they call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We have been called by God to call on the Lord’s name. According to this verse, the believers called on the Lord’s name “in every place.” </p>

They spoke about Him to one another and to the unbelievers. Their speaking was a way of prophesying, the kind of prophesying emphasized in the New Testament. Unlike the prophets in the Old Testament, those who believe in Christ do not need to wait for the Spirit of the Lord to come upon them in order to prophesy. From the time we first called on the name of the Lord, Christ as the living Spirit has been in our spirit. For this reason, Paul could say, “He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83472" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">6:17</span>). How marvelous that the Spirit is mingled with our spirit! Furthermore, this spirit is subject to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83473" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:32">14:32</span>). Because our spirit is subject to us, there is no longer the need to wait for the Spirit to come upon us. Instead, we simply need to exercise our spirit. Surely the Christians in the beginning of the church life exercised their spirit to speak to one another and to unbelievers on behalf of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="nHflLWyF2nFg6U3Z-4mUTN0kfws3Baz2HQJbi1FTEzR-CESxOjvQhJ575ytY-yo5S"> How simple were the saints in the early days of the church life! In their meetings there must have been a great deal of calling, speaking, singing, and praising. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83474" data-verses="Ephesians 5:19">Ephesians 5:19</span>, they spoke to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with their heart to the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="6nl9vMoAoMK12zKD0K5y_Gx6eSA-VnhwxVAnCK_a_w2PSkAV7X6WzBuN8UC31SJbX"> Whenever we gather together in the meetings of the church, we should exhibit what we daily enjoy of the Lord. In an exhibition people manifest or display something they have or have produced. It is possible to exhibit only what we have, not what we do not have. The proper Christian meeting should be an exhibition of our Christian life. It should be <span class="pg" data-page-id="577" id="577">[577]</span> a display of the riches of Christ we experience in our daily walk. If we exercise our spirit to contact the Lord daily, then in the church meetings we shall have something of Christ to share with the saints. </p>

He is a living Person whom we may contact day by day. As the all-inclusive Spirit indwelling our spirit, He is real and available. Hour by hour and even moment by moment, we should exercise our spirit to contact Him in an intimate way. We need to develop the habit of calling on the Lord’s name at all times and in all places. If we build up this practice, we shall be able to say, “O Lord Jesus, Your name is the sweetest name on earth.” </p>
<p data-content-id="wIQrvVteeI1oKV87cJZVVv5dOgX231XUppFUySHr25XvLEhXjHSjbC3_2HzXXD3x4"> As we contact the Lord and call on His name, we must walk with Him, live by Him, and do everything according to the index of His eyes. The index denotes the area of the face around the eyes, the look as being the index of the inward thoughts and feelings to signify the presentation of the whole person. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83475" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:10">2 Corinthians 2:10</span>, Paul lived in the person, the index, of Christ. He did everything according to the expression conveyed through the index of the Lord’s eyes. We also should live according to this index of Christ. However, this is possible only when we are in His presence. If we are away from Him or if there is something between us and Him, we cannot live according to the index of His eyes. For example, a good wife will carefully watch the index of her husband’s eyes and live according to it. This is the way we should live in relation to the Lord. Everything we say or do should be in the index of the eyes of the Lord Jesus. As I am speaking to a brother, I should speak according to the indicators of the Lord’s index. </p>
<p data-content-id="LCOBHh-_8rtpkoOSBhuJ3SLJouiGtADmUdbcGn7K7WCcffclCOEo5EYkos9Kc9G0W"> It is possible for us all to experience this. We can live in such intimate contact with the Lord Jesus that in every detail of our daily life we can behave according to the index of the Lord’s eyes. As I am about to put on a particular tie, I spontaneously know whether or not the Lord likes that tie. <span class="pg" data-page-id="578" id="578">[578]</span> If He approves of it, I shall put it on. But if it displeases Him, I will gladly get rid of it. Oh, how sweet it is to live in the index of the eyes of Christ! </p>
<p data-content-id="mA_96h-ZPzHjy0DOYoWw3UVdng1dAcNQPZK0jfM6FnoHymfKQciucRWHW48k6Jjdb"> We have been emphasizing the need to have intimate contact with the Lord, even to live according to the index of His eyes. When we live in this way, we find out how real, living, and present the Lord is. However, the tragedy is that in the meetings we proclaim, “It is no longer I—Christ lives in me,” but in our daily living we may not allow the Lord to live in us. For example, we may insist on going to the department store, even though we sense deep within that the Lord does not approve. We may bargain with the Lord, asking Him to let us go just this one time and promising Him that we shall not go again. When we speak this way to the Lord, we are not honest or truthful with Him. Whenever we say, “Lord, let me do it just this once,” there will always be a second time. If we do not contact the Lord daily and live by Him, what shall we have of Christ to exhibit in the church meetings? Surely we cannot show forth our disobedience to the Lord, or testify concerning how we went shopping in spite of the Lord’s inward protest. Because they have nothing of Christ to exhibit, many saints are silent in the meetings. But if we enjoy the Lord in our daily life and testify in the meetings of this enjoyment, we shall have even more enjoyment of the Lord. The more we speak of Christ, the more we enjoy Him and the more we are filled unto all the fullness of God. </p>

CHRIST’S RESURRECTION,<br/>THE VITALITY OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p data-content-id="JIZ-QykqNDG1BWmM2KnMOMhZju_iNYeGUiItV_PoJZcGOh57N2xS8o8hJ8R-wu70-"> The resurrection of Christ is the vitality of the gospel. There are many philosophies and religions on earth. But none of these philosophies or religions is vital. On the contrary, every one of them is devoid of life. In a philosophy or religion there may be many teachings and doctrines, but there is no life. Religions are altogether devoid of life. None of them has any vitality. But the Lord’s gospel contains life, even resurrection life. </p>
<p data-content-id="zjs7tyZL5uIfKl2-jisuY3zjK1KLXAhZFTOhXV4aRDYk9Z7bsjPuLM57LGu0lUUp1"> Resurrection life is a life that has conquered death, a life that entered into death, remained in death for a period of time, and then came out of death. Hence, this life is a death-conquering and death-subduing life. Therefore, it is called resurrection life. </p>
<p data-content-id="rOrhtHgFLbPZdw3O4ue4E_N7etWmKRSVh7tw8A0d5A7IYnxmV72X7JLePRUU6vTBF"> The gospel of Christ not only has life; it also has the life power to subdue death, to conquer death, and to annul death. This life, the life that has subdued, conquered, and nullified death, is resurrection. Do you know what resurrection life is? Resurrection is a life that is victorious over death. </p>
<p data-content-id="dRbM-RzPLsExpR48s2PLYESmm-66K_L4EKXbJG9LWljslgHPW3EQrzdq0rf_WG4mx"> We have pointed out that the book of 1 Corinthians may be divided into two large sections, with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83482" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">chapters one through ten</span> forming the first section and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83483" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">chapters eleven through sixteen</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="584" id="584">[584]</span>, the second section. In the first section Paul deals with the daily life of a Christian. For this, Christ is needed. Christ is the unique factor to solve all the problems in a Christian’s daily life. This Christ, the solution to all the problems in the daily life of a Christian, is God’s wisdom and power. He is the One who was incarnated, who lived on earth as a man, who died on the cross, and who was raised from the dead. </p>
<p data-content-id="QM-bErH4QMuLGtlKhNiUmVseR6-Mo4MAKZWMZ85bAWzUJ836Exkha9TFHxEakh9zT"> Some religions have teachings about Jesus, but they are not according to the Bible. The religion of Islam, for example, claims that although Jesus was put on the cross, He did not die there, but was taken away by angels. According to the Moslems and the Koran, this Jesus, the greatest prophet, is in the heavens. The Moslems certainly do not believe in the crucified and resurrected Christ. But according to the Bible, we believe that Christ was crucified, buried, and resurrected. Therefore, our Christ is the Christ of resurrection. Furthermore, He Himself actually is resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83484" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span>). He is the life that conquers death and subdues it. Hallelujah, our Christ is a death-conquering life! He is resurrection! </p>
<p data-content-id="K9Fhzhq9ETFPCPzdkFWRrkfkDyu0qmgItwy5sjP0zVrET7fYv2qxzXlZDmd0Kk9SX"> In order to be God’s wisdom and power to us for the solving of our problems in our daily living, Christ must be the resurrected Christ. Today we have Him in resurrection. The very Christ who is living in us as our life is the resurrected Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="ldCSVKCXVHzwbcJAktI5qY9WW0m-zAHEcxBHCbCwzcGvha9kv82E6htYPVBgcHt9H"> As we have pointed out, in the second section of this book, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83485" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">chapters eleven through sixteen</span>, Paul deals with five problems in the realm of God’s administration. If we would know the divine administration, we need to realize that a rebellion has taken place in the universe. Under the leadership of Satan, the archangel, many angels rebelled against God. This was a matter in the realm of God’s creation. In God’s original creation there was a rebellion. Therefore, later God had a second creation, which mainly involved the creation of man. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83486" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> the creation is primarily the creation of man, not of the heavens and the earth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83487" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span> says, “In the beginning God created the heavens and <span class="pg" data-page-id="585" id="585">[585]</span> the earth” (lit.). The rest of this chapter speaks of the restoration of the heavens and the earth with the creation of the human race. After the creation of man, Satan, the rebellious one, seduced man to follow him. As a result, man also rebelled against God. Therefore, there has been a rebellion among the angelic race and another rebellion among the human race. In creation God was not able to carry out His administration, due to the rebellions of the angels and of man. </p>
<p data-content-id="OT5FVjm4b3rEEp9If2G1UsfkTjficISBPmAujJTvH9vLo8q-qnrQL8cvvI2WkbUHd"> One day, God Himself came in the Son as a man. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83488" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>, His name was called wonderful. He is so wonderful that no one can understand Him thoroughly. He is both God and man at the same time. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83489" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span> also tells us that though He was a child, He was called the mighty God, and that though He was a Son, yet His name was called the everlasting Father. This wonderful God-man lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years. Most of His life was spent in a carpenter’s home in the small town of Nazareth. Imagine, the very One who was called the mighty God and the everlasting Father lived in such a situation for more than thirty years! Eventually, He came forth to minister. He carried on His ministry for three and a half years. At the end of this time, He was brought to the cross. Actually, it is not altogether accurate to say that Christ was brought to the cross, for in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83490" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10</span> He tells us that He was willing to give up His life. This means that He willingly walked to Golgotha, to Calvary. He was willing to be put on the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="45d-EDyyRdejyAtIco9vv--MfBFfH5nEe3ywQ__J1z9MAZSXg-0MsBpqMhRa6rO3L"> The Lord was crucified definitely and physically. With nails in His hands and His feet, He hung on a wooden cross probably for six hours, from nine o’clock in the morning until three o’clock in the afternoon. During the first three hours, man did everything possible to mock Him. Then in the last three hours God came in to judge Him as our substitute. As God was judging Him, Christ shed His blood to redeem us. Out of His side came blood and water: blood for redemption and water for the release of life. Therefore, by His crucifixion, Christ accomplished redemption and released the divine life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="586" id="586">[586]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="oHvwn1F9kPbTytIPVynf_MGPeusawFjhXq5MyP7fRRrtjdCyM9IgKVBeI7sBRsMLT"> Immediately after He died, Christ was given a proper burial in a tomb belonging to a rich man. Then on the third day He was resurrected. The Bible clearly says that Christ was resurrected. On the other hand, the Bible also says that Christ rose up, that He did not need anyone to resurrect Him. How was it possible for Christ to rise from the dead? It was possible because He Himself is resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="3E2ZRbJydxokD8WKMAIbtFfHb0jzb68DmLbropmbxR9wRW14_fX2fsKcexAdJrzWM"> Christ was willing to be buried, to enter into death, the tomb, and Hades. While He was in Hades, He tested death, put death to shame, and conquered and subdued death. He went into the realm of death to tour this region and see what it was able to do. Eventually He discovered that death could do nothing to Him. It did not have the power to hold Him, to retain Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83491" data-verses="Acts 2:24">Acts 2:24</span>). When it was time for Him to rise up, He said farewell to death and walked away. Thus, Christ conquered death, subdued death, and came out of death. This is resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="GBDJJALJ0cF4ks8AH19ucJjnWsP4LTnCFB4KC4XhfQlZ2XYUYk_NIq7g1JKhMOSI_"> We are not able to comprehend fully the Trinity, the incarnation, the crucifixion, or the resurrection. In fact, we cannot even fully understand our own physical life. Can you explain what your life is? Furthermore, do you completely understand your spirit and your psychological heart? It is a fact that we have a spirit and a psychological heart, but we cannot fully understand these things. It certainly would be foolish to refuse to believe in them because we cannot adequately understand them. The same is true with respect to the Trinity, the incarnation, the crucifixion, and the resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="c72SBDvLnZO0HTNpK_Y1vJj4uYnRW9aV0J2G4tOhmUkJUykeLnr0FNqIv6PWDSSzw"> The Word of God is trustworthy. In the Word we are told that God is triune, that God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. One day this God became a man. That was the incarnation. Then this incarnate One, the embodiment of the Triune God, lived on earth and was crucified. This is a mystery. The One who died on the cross was not only a man, but also God. But how could God die? This is a mystery. In one of his hymns Charles Wesley says, “How can it be that Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?” Another line of this hymn (<em>Hymns,</em> #296) reads, “Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies!” <span class="pg" data-page-id="587" id="587">[587]</span> This is indeed a mystery, and we cannot understand it thoroughly. After Christ died, He was buried and resurrected. We may also say that He rose up. Not only was He raised up—He rose up. All these—the incarnation, the crucifixion, the resurrection—are facts. </p>

They were like the Sadducees (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83535" data-verses="Matthew 22:23">Matt. 22:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83536" data-verses="Acts 23:8">Acts 23:8</span>). This is the tenth problem among them. It is the most damaging and destructive to God’s New Testament economy, worse than the heresy of Hymenaeus and Philetus concerning resurrection in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83537" data-verses="2Timothy 2:17-18">2 Timothy 2:17 and 18</span>. Resurrection is the life pulse and lifeline of the divine economy. If there were no resurrection, God would be the God of the dead, not the God of the living (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83538" data-verses="Matthew 22:32">Matt. 22:32</span>). If there were no resurrection, Christ would not have been raised from the dead. He would be a dead Savior, not the One who lives forever (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83539" data-verses="Revelation 1:18">Rev. 1:18</span>) and is able to save to the uttermost (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83540" data-verses="Hebrews 7:25">Heb. 7:25</span>). If there is no resurrection, there would be no living proof of justification by His death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83541" data-verses="Romans 4:25">Rom. 4:25</span>), no imparting of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83542" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>), no regeneration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83543" data-verses="John 3:5">John 3:5</span>), no renewing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83544" data-verses="Titus 3:5">Titus 3:5</span>), no transformation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83545" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Rom. 12:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83546" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Cor. 3:18</span>), and no conformity to the image of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83547" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Rom. 8:29</span>). If there were no resurrection, there would be no members of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83548" data-verses="Romans 12:5">Rom. 12:5</span>), no Body of Christ as His <span class="pg" data-page-id="594" id="594">[594]</span> fullness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83549" data-verses="Ephesians 1:20-23">Eph. 1:20-23</span>), and no church as Christ’s bride (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83550" data-verses="John 3:29">John 3:29</span>) and the new man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83551" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">Eph. 2:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83552" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">4:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83553" data-verses="Colossians 3:10-11">Col. 3:10-11</span>). If there were no resurrection, God’s New Testament economy would altogether collapse and God’s eternal purpose would be nullified. </p>
<p data-content-id="xedXR7KyftfYy5rRtYIjXLRf-xguDXvOsdsaAEtIn7rjMRQgLiFkUjZ1Br4qBKkUQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83554" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:12">verse 12</span> Paul refers to the preaching that Christ has been raised from among the dead. This indicates clearly that the apostles preached the resurrection of Christ. According to the book of Acts, the preaching of the gospel was mainly the preaching of Christ’s resurrection. Although the apostles emphasized the resurrection of Christ, today’s Christian preaching stresses the crucifixion much more than the resurrection. We, however, must follow the apostles to emphasize resurrection as well as crucifixion. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zjyvva9_mwbWU7v14CMragfkXMl76M85FJIYr3C2npxvRcj28K_niY4FY2FqTLVIx"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83555" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:13">Verse 13</span> continues, “But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.” This is the first point of Paul’s rebuttal. It is a fact that Christ has been raised from among the dead. How, then, could some say that there is no resurrection? If there were no resurrection, then Christ could not have been raised from among the dead. </p>
<p data-content-id="A3Oa3UPcjrJzR4wlouzXCJftgWRSWHHN5I2G0osifE_yD30wsSCVCR1Rhevz1xRO7"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83556" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:14">verse 14</span> Paul says, “And if Christ has not been raised, then is our preaching vain; your faith also is vain.” The Greek word rendered vain means empty, void. Without the living Christ in resurrection, both the preaching of the gospel and our faith in it would be empty and void, having no reality. Preaching the death of Christ without preaching His resurrection would be vain. The resurrection of Christ is what causes our preaching to become vital and prevailing. Such a preaching would never be in vain. Furthermore, apart from Christ’s resurrection, our faith would also be vain. Without the resurrection of Christ, both our preaching and our believing become vain. This is a very serious matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="F_0pIc17fjqQrLFCajrHceBnEm3EkINB_pIu9NMW-twLqCp0pOLPqCxrSvbNiuAOt"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83557" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:15">verse 15</span> Paul goes on to say, “And we are found also false witnesses of God, because we witnessed concerning God that He raised Christ, Whom He did not raise if indeed the dead are not raised.” This is another strong point in Paul’s rebuttal. <span class="pg" data-page-id="595" id="595">[595]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="CFF3xQmaFvwJ5j4xk2Wr_M9AHisFFvvZCxIjhulhhQwaE4qISeDhS6DHqSHn3a8XL"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83558" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:16">verse 16</span> Paul says, “For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised.” Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83559" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:17">verse 17</span> says, “And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.” The Greek word rendered futile means fruitless, worthless. Without Christ resurrected to live in us as our life and as everything to us, our faith in Him is fruitless, worthless, and without any issue like the impartation of life, freedom from sin, victory over Satan, and growth in life. The word futile used here is even stronger than the word vain found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83560" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:14">verse 14</span>. Something that is vain is empty. But the word futile indicates labor without result, work without any gain. If there is no resurrection, we may still believe, but eventually nothing results from our believing. Hence, our faith becomes futile. </p>
<p data-content-id="PxQUR1aSfVg1g5EN0uN6GBmA7oa_DRqoAAY2oLF94p-AdYjLrSH1ujpvA-dj4BNGp"> Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83561" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:17">verse 17</span>, if Christ has not been raised, we are still in our sins. Christ’s death saves us from the condemnation of our sins, not from the power of sin. It is His resurrection life that delivers us from the power of sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83562" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Rom. 8:2</span>). If Christ were not resurrected, we would still remain in sins and under the power of sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="-31E-FlFhHZVWfRVsibLPN9Po-xOz3xA3OJ5Vu-NyImqaLANCOsF5aHepDtdpWJmP"> Sins are one thing, and the power of sin is something else. Because sins brought in condemnation, we became sinners full of sins, and there was condemnation upon us. But through Christ’s death, that condemnation has been removed. Thus, the death of Christ has saved us from the condemnation of sins. But His death cannot save us from the power of sin. The condemnation of sins is objective, whereas the power of sin is subjective. Being saved from the condemnation of sins can be accomplished once for all. But to be saved from the power of sin is a lifelong matter and a daily matter, even a moment-by-moment matter. The problem we all have with our temper illustrates our need to be saved daily from the power of sin. You have been saved from the condemnation of sins, but you still need to be saved from your temper. </p>
<p data-content-id="prVBOIVQEyCQk7WbC65wKBFpZIyHUt92oIKJiha3N6sMf93hlzv0FeRHAEKBhJS-J"> When someone asks you if you have been saved, you need to answer in a proper way. You may answer with a question: “Do you mean saved from hell and from God’s judgment, or <span class="pg" data-page-id="596" id="596">[596]</span> saved from the power of sin?” Then go on to say, “You ask me if I have been saved. Now I want to ask you if you have been saved from your temper.” Who can say that he has been completely saved from his temper? We need to help others realize that we have been saved from sins, but still need to be saved from the power of sin. To be saved in this way we need resurrection power. </p>
<p data-content-id="vFgafReeId0NLp6vSzTQo14EsX_DOCFdxRfaNo4gGNBc9CrkwduxPEplaAWErKNdi"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83563" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Romans 8:2</span>, the law of the Spirit of life frees us from the law of sin. The law of sin actually denotes the power of sin, just as the law of gravity actually refers to the power of gravity. Only resurrection life can deliver us from the power of sin and from the law of sin. Resurrection life contains a law that is more powerful than the law of sin. An airplane can fly because of the operation of a power that overcomes gravity. In like manner, we can overcome the power of sin by the operation of Christ’s powerful resurrection life. </p>
<p data-content-id="WPLFJeiDr66zP26-znBSbuxrk_rGZbWaxhCyw_QagmclIUlGYx9j371es8KAwySLd"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83564" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:17">verse 17</span>, Paul does not write in a philosophical way or in a theoretical manner. He appeals to the experience of those who argue against resurrection and then uses their experience to defeat them. In other words, Paul’s rebuttal is very practical. Should anyone say that there is no resurrection, then Christ has not been resurrected. Then what shall we do concerning the power of sin? For this, we need resurrection. </p>

Here the word perished means never to be resurrected, but to remain in death forever. If Christ has not been raised from among the dead, then those believers in Christ who have died have perished. They believed in Christ in order to be saved. But if Christ has not been raised, they will not be resurrected either. On the contrary, they will remain in death and perish. This is Paul’s argument. By this we see once again that he argued concerning resurrection in a practical way. </p>

If the dead are actually not raised, why indeed are they baptized for them?” The phrase “baptized for the dead” means to be baptized for others who <span class="pg" data-page-id="606" id="606">[606]</span> are dead. This was not an official matter generally practiced by the early churches, but a personal activity of some individual believers for dead persons for whom they were concerned who may have believed in the Lord but were not baptized before they died. They did this in hope of their resurrection from among the dead at the Lord’s coming back (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83658" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:16">1 Thes. 4:16</span>), since in baptism resurrection is strongly signified (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83659" data-verses="Colossians 2:12">Col. 2:12</span>). The apostle uses what they did to strengthen the truth of resurrection. This does not mean, however, that he sanctions baptism by some believers for the dead. </p>
<p data-content-id="c72SBDvLnZO0HTNpK_Y1vJj4uYnRW9aV0JWG7tuhmUkJUykeLnr0FNqIv6PWDSSzw"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83660" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:29">verse 29</span> the word “for” actually means on behalf of. Some believers had relatives, neighbors, or friends who also believed in the Lord, but who died without being baptized. Out of love for them, certain believers were baptized on behalf of the ones who had died. This was not taught by the apostles, but we know from church history it was practiced by the believers, although the practice was not common. The fact that one believer would be baptized on behalf of another believer who had died signifies a strong belief in resurrection. Baptism signifies death, burial, and resurrection. But if there is no resurrection and if Christians simply die and are buried, why would someone be baptized on behalf of the dead? The fact that someone would be baptized for the dead indicates a belief, an expectation, that the dead one would be resurrected. Paul refers to this practice as part of his rebuttal against the heresy which claimed that there was no resurrection. Here Paul seems to be saying, “If the dead are not raised, then why are others baptized for them to signify that they will be resurrected?” This is Paul’s meaning here. </p>

Why would he daily risk his life? Instead, if there is no resurrection, he should enjoy this present life. </p>

<p data-content-id="DeXM5GXdbazrZOx-ax9Rc0jrX8cWBb4GPfntN5JXJuzK9JlkY0coVF7VTZZGpUzMQ"> The Corinthian believers were the fruit of the apostle’s labor, a labor in which he risked his life and was in danger of death. In them the apostle can boast of this. By this boasting he protests that daily he dies. The apostle’s boasting in the Corinthians as the fruit of the risk of his life is in Christ, not in himself, because his labor is not by himself but by Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="S4UBTaDBLhflHNtSeJetHIxvSeWeK0YxcNFFUg7ZupcAWEz0O3GGyaxAZbn0GYdQO"> Paul was like a soldier risking his life on the battlefield. He fought for God’s kingdom, and daily he died for the sake of the Corinthians. When he came to preach the gospel to them, he risked his life. While he was in Corinth, he died daily. It was not an easy thing for Paul to come to Corinth in the Gentile world. This world was opposed to anything Jewish and also opposed to anything Christian. Nevertheless, Paul daily risked his life in order to preach the gospel to them. But because of his willingness to die daily, a number of those at Corinth were saved. </p>
<p data-content-id="gtgtI35Vr92rZOQoDGIVGs8NRXsfme5uzQd2yUglaZ2BEOI4Y3brU9LirmsGa_3J7"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83667" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:32">verse 32</span> Paul uses a figure of speech: “If after the manner of men I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” The phrase “wild beasts” used here is a figure of speech denoting evil persons or matters. The manner of men in fighting against any evil person or matter is to receive a temporal reward. But the apostle will be rewarded for his fighting with evil persons and matters for the gospel’s sake at the resurrection in the future (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83668" data-verses="Luke 14:14">Luke 14:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83669" data-verses="2Timothy 4:8">2 Tim. 4:8</span>). </p>

Thus, he had to fight against evil persons and evil things. But if there were no resurrection, what profit would it have been to Paul to fight in this way? As Paul says, “If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” This appears to be a quotation of a saying of that day, a maxim of the Epicureans. If there is no resurrection, we believers shall have no hope in the future and thus become the most miserable of all men (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83671" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:19">v. 19</span>). If so, <span class="pg" data-page-id="608" id="608">[608]</span> we should enjoy our life today, forgetting the future, like the Epicureans. </p>

By this word the apostle warns the Corinthian believers not to have any companionship with those heretics who say there is no resurrection. Such evil companionship will corrupt their faith and Christian virtues. </p>
<p data-content-id="tiNQgxDpsd4NWazI4KY7Ls3Zc1jf31TN5mW0rmpv7jbyJhqTUCAeHZ8B89sG6uKJy"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83673" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:33">verse 33</span> Paul charges the Corinthians not to pay attention to the deceitful and nonsensical heresy that there is no resurrection. Those who listen to this heresy will be deceived by it. Furthermore, if they become companions of heretics, that companionship will corrupt good morals. This principle applies to us in the church life today. </p>
<p data-content-id="h8T7ZUYpMcEVtTeTw4Ei-WaWWau_ZtkWF0p7RhlWsI31mZB3IXYJad2ffrJvNMmVr"> Certain of those who left the Lord’s recovery and now speak evil concerning it may try to influence others who have remained in the church life. If you take in negative thoughts and become a companion to those who oppose the church life, that companionship will corrupt your church life. The good morals mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83674" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:33">verse 33</span> include loving the Lord, living for the future, risking our lives for the gospel, and practicing the proper church life. It actually includes all the good things covered in the entire book of 1 Corinthians. </p>
<p data-content-id="UF3NSi3eZh7Dl_ZC3t8J3SGQLMJgBmML5wA7k4WjfdnUmnLxDxMDWGNZfNU2kahGc"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83675" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:34">verse 34</span> Paul continues his charge: “Become sober righteously and do not sin, for some are ignorant of God. I speak to your shame.” To become sober, righteously, is to awaken to soberness from a drunken stupor; it is to cease, righteously, to be drunken. The word “righteously” here means to be right with God and man. To say there is no resurrection offends God and man, and it is sin. Hence, the apostle advises the misled Corinthians to awake soberly from this sin to be right with God and man. They were drunken unrighteously in a stupor of the no-resurrection heresy. They needed to cease being in that stupor. <span class="pg" data-page-id="609" id="609">[609]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Mdwix_GaOy3SQn0ueCAHqoNdP1UMTDSJJy6RUuBvWkxI-OJG9yVXJjndZOAKNjsqN"> Literally, the words “are ignorant” are “have ignorance.” To be heretical in saying there is no resurrection is to be ignorant of God, not knowing God’s power or His economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83676" data-verses="Matthew 22:29-32">Matt. 22:29-32</span>). This is a shame to the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="VAmSFImgVrwWBDh3eU1j3ZFZPnAW6HkY_IOA8bpXxzEgwGujPfsebgBAiBEiWFZI6"> As Christians, we must be awake to soberness. We should not be like the Epicureans, who wanted only to enjoy life and did not care for tomorrow. We need to cease, righteously, to be drugged. Anyone who says that there is no resurrection is not righteous with God or man. Likewise, those who oppose the church life are not right with either God or man. </p>

Christ became a life-giving Spirit through resurrection with a spiritual body. Adam as a living soul is natural; Christ as a life-giving Spirit is resurrected. First, in incarnation, He became flesh for redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83688" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83689" data-verses="John 1:29">29</span>). Then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit for imparting life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83690" data-verses="John 10:10">John 10:10</span>). He had a soulish body like Adam through incarnation. He has a spiritual body through resurrection. His soulish body has become a spiritual one through resurrection. Now He is a life-giving Spirit in resurrection, with a spiritual body, ready to be received by His believers. When we believe into Him, He enters our spirit, and we are joined to Him as the life-giving Spirit. Hence, we become one spirit with Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83691" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). Our spirit is made alive and resurrected with Him. Eventually our present soulish body will also become a spiritual body in resurrection just as His body is (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83692" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:52-54">vv. 52-54</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83693" data-verses="Philippians 3:21">Phil. 3:21</span>). </p>

Adam, the first man, was the head of the old creation. When <span class="pg" data-page-id="614" id="614">[614]</span> God created him, Adam became a living soul. This means that he became a person, a human being. In Hebrew the word for Adam means man. Because God created Adam a living soul, his main part was the soul, which is for the old creation. Today, in principle, if we live in our soul, by our soul, or for our soul, we are in the old creation. The soul is the center and lifeline of the old creation. A person may be moral, but if he lives in the soul, he still belongs to the old creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="WPLFJeiDr66zP26-znBSbuxrk_rGZbWaxiiyw9QagmclIUlGYx9j371es8KAwySLd"> Christ being the last Adam implies a termination and conclusion of the old creation. The old creation ends with a man, the last Adam. This Man who terminated the old creation became in resurrection a life-giving Spirit.

<p data-content-id="2x5QcsCAgui9NXQYMVnCg51gf1NTLk96AzgmczHan8nZifIVz9C609J7eMcjMZTbI"> The old creation was created by God. The new creation, however, comes into being not by creation, but by resurrection. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83695" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">verse 45</span> implies two creations: the old creation with man as a living soul to be the center and lifeline, and the new creation in resurrection with the life-giving Spirit as the center and lifeline. </p>
<p data-content-id="uEOnd0iMx5POKDetv2t0ZpmBAFDGOo1C6nJS1IDWbwDZZmpB_EzDqM1j3iDcpaIYK"> Many Christians today are short of revelation, of the proper spiritual vision, and oppose us when we say that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. But to deny that Christ is the life-giving Spirit is equal to denying the reality of resurrection. The life-giving Spirit is the life pulse of Christ’s resurrection. If Christ had merely been resurrected with a body and did not become a life-giving Spirit, His resurrection would not mean nearly as much to us. It would simply be an objective fact unrelated to life. It could then be compared to the resurrection of Lazarus. The resurrection of Lazarus was merely an act of resurrection; it did not produce, bring forth, anything related to life. But Christ’s resurrection is absolutely a matter related to life, for in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="fonV3HEy2MU2N2I0YaxDvgIBiUxgNE7RRhjm88oXAqnMbBjw-ecpzlsiH3gTPoymz"> Most Christians believe in resurrection simply in an objective way. To them the resurrection of Christ is nothing more than an objective act, an act which is not related to the members of the Body of Christ. Those who have this <span class="pg" data-page-id="615" id="615">[615]</span> understanding of Christ’s resurrection also regard His ascension strictly in an objective way. They do not realize that the ascension has something to do with us subjectively. From the point of view of some Christians, both the resurrection and ascension of Christ have nothing to do with us as far as life is concerned. On the contrary, both are objective facts accomplished by Christ. They hold to these facts as part of their fundamental beliefs. </p>
<p data-content-id="IRiW_XGsakCOG5c2bMCUVFSliMgMWxUp9lPlbgQrEOCdIvTxWqJqOujXL4il8Paen"> Resurrection was not merely an objective act accomplished by Christ. It is very much related to us subjectively. Through incarnation Christ became a man; He became us. Therefore, incarnation was much more than an objective fact. It was a process that brought God into humanity. The principle is the same with the process of resurrection. Resurrection was not merely an act in itself; it was a process to bring forth the life-giving Spirit. Through the process of resurrection, the Man who ended the old creation became the life-giving Spirit, the germinating element of the new creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="HGln5zZ0kg7BRF2G3k4ch5kayK9fIchfK7oVVifWdxC7j7vo-3Hmf4N_nWwoJM4tK"> Very few Christians have seen that Christ in resurrection is a life-giving Spirit. Andrew Murray, however, understood something concerning this. He wrote about it in his masterpiece, <em>The Spirit of Christ,</em> in the chapter entitled, “The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus.” The Spirit of the glorified Jesus is actually the Lord Jesus Himself in resurrection and in glory. When He entered into resurrection, He became the Spirit who gives life. This life-giving Spirit is the essence to germinate a new creation. The germinating element of the new creation is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="XfZ84nrEImIc-Nz7b9qjdkNeXbVUzpA1pR8tLSvDe1z-Kgbse9Vggac7oUtrY8Ta8"> Traditional Christian theology opposes the truth that Christ has become a life-giving Spirit. In the opinion of many, this is heretical. Actually, it is a truth found in the depths of the Word of God. Eventually, the truth will prevail. </p>

To repeat, this verse implies the old creation with the soul as the center and the new creation with the Spirit as the center. This Spirit is nothing less than Christ, the Triune God. Actually, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="616" id="616">[616]</span> life-giving Spirit is the processed Triune God. God has passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. Now in resurrection He is the life-essence to germinate the new creation. We have become the new creation germinated by the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit. In <em>The Economy of God</em> we emphasize the human spirit and Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit. The highest definition of resurrection is that it is the process by which Christ, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="JIZ-QykqNDG1BWmM2KnMOMhZju_iNYeGUhYtcvvoJZcGOh57N2xS8o8hJ8R-wu70-"> In 1964, when we were working on our hymnal, one brother advised us not to publish the hymns on Christ as the Spirit. He admitted that the Bible reveals that Christ is the Spirit. However, he said that because most Christians would not accept this teaching, we should not include hymns on this matter in our hymnal. I told him that I would never force anyone to follow my teaching, but that I did need the liberty to teach the truth from the Bible. I went on to point out that our goal is first to save sinners by preaching the gospel; second, to edify the saints and build them up through proper teaching so that they may grow in life; third, to take the unique ground of the church to establish local churches; and fourth, to have the fellowship of all the churches as one Body. I said that as long as our work has these four aspects, we have the same aim and the same goal. I also told him that I have a heavy burden concerning the matter of Christ being the Spirit and that I have no choice except to minister according to this burden. I told him that I must declare that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit. It is not up to me whether others will accept this teaching or reject it. At the time of Martin Luther, not everyone accepted the truth of justification by faith. If Luther had been hesitant on this point, how could there have been a Reformation? I told him strongly that I am not afraid of opposition. </p>
<p data-content-id="zjs7tyZL5uIfKl2-jisuY3zjK1KLXAhZFQehfFIaRDYk9Z7bsjPuLM57LGu0lUUp1"> I do not want anyone to follow me blindly. Paul says, “Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83697" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">11:1</span>). If I follow Christ, if I follow the Bible, if I follow the truth, then you should follow me. Likewise, if you follow Christ, the Bible, <span class="pg" data-page-id="617" id="617">[617]</span> and the truth, I should follow you. In this manner, we should follow one another. This is what we endeavor to do in the Lord’s recovery. </p>

<p data-content-id="TgPV7WYzePxLg1dlN-g0NWu5ni7DunVUy1T8g7042YLj5QKtSQNXUKE8xxgPy_6YT"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83754" data-verses="1Corinthians 16:1">verse 1</span> Paul says, “Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you do also.” This is the eleventh matter dealt with by the apostle in this Epistle, a matter concerned with money, mammon, and material possessions. All of fallen mankind are under the domination of mammon and material possessions (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83755" data-verses="Matthew 6:19-21">Matt. 6:19-21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83756" data-verses="Matthew 6:24-25">24-25</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83757" data-verses="Matthew 6:30">30</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83758" data-verses="Matthew 19:21-22">19:21-22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83759" data-verses="Luke 12:13-19">Luke 12:13-19</span>). At the day of Pentecost, under the power of the Holy Spirit, all the believers overthrew this domination and had all their possessions in common for distribution to the needy ones (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83760" data-verses="Acts 2:44-45">Acts 2:44-45</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83761" data-verses="Acts 4:32">4:32</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83762" data-verses="Acts 4:34-37">34-37</span>). That practice, due to the weakness of the believers’ fallen nature (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83763" data-verses="Acts 5:1-11">Acts 5:1-11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83764" data-verses="Acts 6:1">6:1</span>), did not last long. It was already over by the Apostle Paul’s time. Then the believers needed grace to overcome the power of mammon and material things and to release them from Satan’s domination for an offering to the Lord to fulfill His purpose. Resurrection life is the supply for the believers to live such a life, a life trusting in God, not in treasures of material possessions, a life not for today but for the future, not for this age but for the coming age (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83765" data-verses="Luke 12:16-21">Luke 12:16-21</span>; <span class="pg" data-page-id="626" id="626">[626]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83766" data-verses="1Timothy 6:17-19">1 Tim. 6:17-19</span>), a life that overthrows the usurpation of temporal and uncertain riches. This may be the reason that this dealing follows the one concerning the reality of resurrection life. In any case this dealing is related to God’s administration among the churches. </p>
<p data-content-id="nHflLWyF2nFg6U3Z-4mUTN0kfws3Baz2HTZbqn1TEzR-CESxOjvQhJ575ytY-yo5S"> It is a crucial matter that this dealing follows a chapter concerning the reality of resurrection life. Resurrection is not only the power over sin and death; resurrection is a power over mammon and material possessions. Therefore, immediately following the chapter on resurrection, Paul turns to the matter of material possessions. </p>
<p data-content-id="eUZwTHuTDFPfNYOCu1n50UUorE6pAtRKP9vM5-aY_zFf532UtF6kNi_wohlwMw9hh"> From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83767" data-verses="1Corinthians 16:1">verse 1</span> we see that Paul gave the same direction to the church in Corinth as he did to the churches of Galatia. This strongly indicates that all the local churches should be the same in their practice (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83768" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:17">7:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83769" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:16">11:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83770" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:33">14:33</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="5cvwE7fG0BCj-rNo6NGmlSxcfn8js06QFKiHjBiKtAHd3P8c8SI8FsHkl6iaraK0i"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83771" data-verses="1Corinthians 16:2">verse 2</span> Paul continues, “On the first day of every week let each one of you lay aside by himself, storing up as he may be prospered, that no collections be made when I come.” The seventh day of the week, the Sabbath, was a memorial of God’s creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83772" data-verses="Genesis 2:1-3">Gen. 2:1-3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83773" data-verses="Exodus 20:8">Exo. 20:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83774" data-verses="Exodus 20:11">11</span>). The first day of the week is a symbol of the Lord’s resurrection; it is the day the Lord resurrected from among the dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83775" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20:1</span>). It is called the Lord’s Day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83776" data-verses="Revelation 1:10">Rev. 1:10</span>). The New Testament saints meet and offer their possessions on this day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83777" data-verses="Acts 20:7">Acts 20:7</span>), the day of the Lord’s resurrection, signifying that they have been resurrected with the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83778" data-verses="Ephesians 2:6">Eph. 2:6</span>) through His resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83779" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>), and that they meet to remember Him and worship God with their offerings in resurrection by the resurrection life, not by their natural life. </p>
<p data-content-id="N9DQWvp40eBT2VybP3ap72SyWkeUtkAvgA_yCQS_h8YrqVB4HFvlImtcJ6D_lT9Tg"> Our giving must be in resurrection life, not in our natural life. However, much of the giving by Christians today is done according to the natural life. Money is raised by the natural life in a way that is absolutely in the old creation. Furthermore, those who give large amounts are often publicly recognized, whereas those who give small amounts are ignored. Our giving must be completely different from this. Our offerings must be presented in resurrection and by resurrection. <span class="pg" data-page-id="627" id="627">[627]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="tiNQgxDpsd4NWazI4KY7Ls3Zc1jf31TN5l20omJv7jbyJhqTUCAeHZ8B89sG6uKJy"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83780" data-verses="1Corinthians 16:3">verse 3</span> Paul says, “And when I arrive, whomever you may approve, I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem.” The Greek word rendered gift can also be translated grace. This was a kind of fellowship, under the apostle’s direction, of the churches in the Gentile world with the church in Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83781" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1-2">2 Cor. 8:1-2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83782" data-verses="Romans 15:25-27">Rom. 15:25-27</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="h8T7ZUYpMcEVtTeTw4Ei-WaWWau_ZtkWF3J7SgFWsI31mZB3IXYJad2ffrJvNMmVr"> We have pointed out again and again that in the second section of 1 Corinthians, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83783" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">chapters eleven through sixteen</span>, Paul deals with matters in the realm of the divine administration. This section begins with the headship of God and consummates with a seemingly insignificant matter—the gift of material things for the saints. Whether or not we are truly in God’s administration, or for God’s administration, and are carrying out God’s administration, can be tested by how we are related to material things and how we handle our money. If we use our money in a worldly way, then no matter what we may say about resurrection, we are not truly in God’s administration. The extent to which we are in the divine administration and for the divine administration is determined by how we care for money and material possessions. </p>
<p data-content-id="UF3NSi3eZh7Dl_ZC3t8J3SGQLMJgBmML5zg7n52jfdnUmnLxDxMDWGNZfNU2kahGc"> Throughout the years, we in the Lord’s recovery have been hearing His Word and have been built up in the riches of Christ. We have surely been nourished by the divine Word. Now if we all would be faithful to live for God’s administration in caring for money and material matters, there would be no financial needs in the recovery. For example, certainly we can exercise our spirit and our will to save a small amount of money each week, perhaps just two dollars and fifty cents, and give this to the Lord for His move on earth. One day, instead of having our lunch at a restaurant, we may eat a simple meal prepared at home. Then the money saved could be given to the Lord. Imagine what the situation would be if we all were faithful to do something like this week by week! </p>
<p data-content-id="Mdwix_GaOy3SQn0ueCAHqoNdP1UMTDSJJxaRXuhvWkxI-OJG9yVXJjndZOAKNjsqN"> In such a spiritual book dealing with spiritual and heavenly matters, Paul eventually turns to the very practical matter of finances. It is quite easy to talk about the <span class="pg" data-page-id="628" id="628">[628]</span> headship and say, “Praise the Lord, I am under the headship of Christ! Christ is my Head. Concerning His headship, I do not have any problems.” But can you say that you have no problem with the matter Paul brings up in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83784" data-verses="1Corinthians 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>? We may talk about the victory of resurrection over sin and death, but what about the victory in resurrection over your use of your money and material possessions? It is easy for our talk to be abstract and impractical concerning the headship, discerning the Body, the gifts, and resurrection. For this reason, Paul, in God’s wisdom, deals with the matter of giving immediately after the matter of resurrection. If we truly live in resurrection, we shall not have a problem with money or material things. </p>
<p data-content-id="VAmSFImgVrwWBDh3eU1j3ZFZPnAW6HkY_LuA_bJXxzEgwGujPfsebgBAiBEiWFZI6"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83785" data-verses="1Corinthians 16:2">verse 2</span> Paul specifically mentions “the first day of every week.” We have seen that this day, the Lord’s Day, is a symbol of Christ’s resurrection. We are not those who live and act in the seventh day of the week, for that day is a memorial of the old creation. We should be living in resurrection on the first day of the week. This means that we should not be seventh-day people; we should be first-day people. If we live in resurrection, in the first day of the week, then in the Lord’s recovery there will be no problem regarding financial need. </p>

This Epistle was written in Ephesus, where the apostle stayed for three years on the third journey of his ministry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83790" data-verses="Acts 19:21-22">Acts 19:21-22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83791" data-verses="Acts 20:1">20:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83792" data-verses="Acts 20:31">31</span>). </p>

In this verse Paul seems to be saying, “You must be in the first day of the week, living in resurrection. You must also be under the headship of Christ and of God, you must discern the Body, desire the greater gifts, practice the gifts in love, and be in resurrection. If this is your situation, then my young co-worker will have no fear when he is with you. See that Timothy is with you without fear, for he is working the work of the Lord even as I am.” </p>
