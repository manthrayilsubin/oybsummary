<h1 class="title" data-content-id="U-smkr1a6dFJm6oEW-7auOkFm-3XcaVwUVyMfwU3YgBr5P5j6Up1AlI-ogYff8uiJ">THE BACKGROUND AND POSITION OF THE BOOK</h1><p data-content-id="MbvcrlXtA4GGPOZNOvDot4_k7L0O9t4WsRhB1iUfY2NjrQ3EE-RVlAKh7NIKw-9kI"> In the book of Colossians Christ is unveiled to a fuller extent than in any other book in the Bible. In this short book many terms and expressions are used to describe Christ. Before we consider the revelation of Christ in Colossians, we need to pay attention to the background and position of this book, both of which are crucial. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Vehc_DxwcgXUMWVvg6ZqRxQAd9mkWasmilbKcMYbZp13kc_c_BsTJjIrnVSGak81f">I. THE BACKGROUND</h2><p data-content-id="iiCXRFpuXcPrT8Ib2ei9Wmk1HkZymN2ws6tpqdIZHirz4qBni4rQoR_fScofdndKl"> Three verses, all of which are warnings, enable us to see the situation which caused this Epistle to be written—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91934" data-verses="Colossians 2:8">Colossians 2:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91935" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">16</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91936" data-verses="Colossians 2:18">18</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91937" data-verses="Colossians 2:8">Colossians 2:8</span> says, “Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.” This verse mentions four negative things which can cause us to be carried off as captives: philosophy, empty deceit, tradition, and the elements of the world. In the eyes of fallen mankind, philosophy is very good; it is the most highly developed product of culture. The elements of the world, elementary principles of certain teachings, may also be highly regarded by society. Nevertheless, philosophy, deceit, tradition, and the elements of the world can cause us to be carried off as prey. </p>
<p data-content-id="1aJmujdY8zf3BLa1Nx2x7qmP08CULz-3l_vTi90iiOmndjKLwrW8aLxpNk6UPXsej"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91938" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">2:16</span> Paul says, “Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths.” Here Paul lists a number of things that are positive: eating, drinking, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths. He warned the Colossians not to let anyone judge them with respect to these things. <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="9CMGouSfiMWAlo_AF78CKdna83X884-Yi6ay6JvhbqmWxQR8qwvMZ9jTvWt74Euid"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91939" data-verses="Colossians 2:18">verse 18</span> Paul goes on to say, “Let no one purposely defraud you of your prize, in humility and worship of the angels, standing on things which he has seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh.” The prize spoken of in this verse is Christ as our enjoyment. It is possible to be defrauded of this prize through humility, a very positive human virtue. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="jSqu1fKMETv3AEO0jRP6XSxNGaR2Tgp3Bj8ZR-J9t-t3Qs846TNRWzfLsChMbFjod">A. Asceticism Having Saturated<br/>the Church at Colosse</h2><p data-content-id="uei5QW3MGv90tAA2FxD3LJZfaN3-F4R75QFjeBrVrSzVrCFjdoepppbzqxBliOuF8"> The reason Paul gave these warnings was that the church in Colosse had been saturated with asceticism. This asceticism was related to legality of ordinances (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91940" data-verses="Colossians 2:20-21">2:20-21</span>) and to Judaistic observances (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91941" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">2:16</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="f5FHReDvsyzvBMFzyvsIslz0SO1lMYqgmUB6rb4-E6X-5JRriI2ZE461KcHMoNa9f">B. Mysticism Having Invaded<br/>the Church at Colosse</h2><p data-content-id="Ij7bPPSnYgJ7k5YLk7p3WF7OEv049jispqhi6sQh09yxxcsmTBisNQ0qrwyEIQciJ"> Furthermore, mysticism had invaded the church. This mysticism was related to Gnosticism, which was composed of Egyptian, Babylonian, Jewish, and Greek philosophies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91942" data-verses="Colossians 2:8">2:8</span>), and to the worship of angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91943" data-verses="Colossians 2:18">2:18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="HJXSCv7FjRX11Nlg8l5j7efQm7HgONZ6T3GdC5v5dCb9ChbHCNsZDKBUk5DL1WVtx"> The vital point concerning the background of the book of Colossians is that culture had been brought into the church life. The population of Colosse was a mixture of Gentiles and Jews. The Gentiles and the Jews had different cultures. For the most part, the Gentiles were under the influence of Greek culture with its philosophy. At that time, however, Greek philosophy was no longer pure. Rather it was a mingling of various philosophies. Furthermore, the Gentile culture was at least somewhat blended with Jewish religious concepts. </p>
<p data-content-id="XqFwK4-uCOxRvgyEbG31TFRJfAXgOw1v26KaLLx9rvafbSffqSmEd1W12EaU8vYF3"> This mixture of cultures flooded the church at Colosse. The church should be a house filled with Christ and constituted with Him. Instead, the church there had been invaded by culture. To a large extent, Christ as the unique element in the church life was being replaced by various aspects of this mixed culture. The constituent of the church should be Christ and Christ alone, for the church is the Body of Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> Therefore, the content of the church should be nothing other than Christ Himself. Nevertheless, the good elements of culture, especially philosophy and religion, had invaded the church and saturated it. </p>
<p data-content-id="kX1nUfZuqQkzrLrgt3NFkih8nAhwQ2eJ9RDPm9pQmA9VJDK3iAAZbqak9qWDfH_Sw"> In particular, a type of religious asceticism had made inroads into the church life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91944" data-verses="Colossians 2:20-21">Verses 20 and 21</span>, which speak of ordinances regarding handling, tasting, and touching, refer to this. We know that this asceticism was religious in nature because it was related to the worship of angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91945" data-verses="Colossians 2:18">2:18</span>). Hence, the asceticism that flooded the church in Colosse was not crude, but refined and cultured. </p>
<p data-content-id="J_nFMNQorB6p2GT8JBzVIJEJhh9RIYNHJ9mfOn7jgTGQpHDcX8vywWDQZdhqUypmp"> To some, the worship of angels may seem quite good, far superior to the worship of reptiles, birds, and beasts. Nevertheless, angel worship is idolatry, although a somewhat refined type of idolatry. People of high culture do not worship animals, but they may be open to worship angels. Some justify such a practice by saying that they do not worship idols, but, in humility, worship the heavenly servants of God. Regarding themselves as too low to worship God directly, they may feel that they must worship Him through an intermediary. This concept has been assimilated into Catholicism, which teaches that we may need the help of an intermediary in order to contact God. In principle at least, Catholicism has adopted the practice of using an intermediary in the worship of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="zxxKVZo0L_3UdrO9iX46Tdlv1n1Hq-fB11uoqtjPBjhY_rEsDeSQDqGrA0qATN0ay"> It is the subtlety of the enemy to flood the church with the elements of culture. This is what he was doing when the book of Colossians was written. His strategy was to send a mixture of Jewish religion and Gentile philosophy into the church and to saturate the church with this cultural mixture. From the human point of view, this culture, particularly its asceticism, was very good. Asceticism has a good purpose and goal; it attempts to enable people to deal with their lusts. However, we must see that Satan’s strategy in flooding the church with culture is to use the most highly developed aspects of culture to replace Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="aw_owglmYsbhVQpnqDeZZJvwShVpyKPcebdjcPDhLYFI9FSkEF8RpLBEHkqv-h5U3"> Do not think that this phenomenon was limited to the first century. It is still with us today. In today’s Christianity Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> has been almost altogether replaced by other things, especially by good things. The name of Christ may be found in Christianity, but the reality of Christ may be absent. Many things have become substitutes for Christ. For example, even the teaching of the Bible is used by the enemy of God as such a substitute for Christ Himself. Many Christians study the Bible without contacting Christ. Due to Satan’s subtlety, any kind of Christian work can also replace Christ Himself. Christian work should minister Christ. However, some Christian works make their particular goal a substitute for Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="bII_pa96wW65xpS_TOga8Qb0s02g1fUpsR-fiE2GZ2XncQE7FKuNnsp2sqi-cXeIt"> In today’s religion some pastors and ministers may allow their own personalities to replace Christ. Certain Christian workers have attractive, powerful personalities. They use their personalities to draw people not to Christ, but to themselves. This is the reason that many Christians compliment and even praise the personalities of certain pastors. Those who do not have such a strong personality may attract people by their niceness or their humility. Christians may choose to attend a particular so-called church because the minister there is kind and sympathetic. </p>
<p data-content-id="qcLWvpSjI1XL62hLozF8aNmkeecb4B6Dsla5rdBghIZYVZKEAFjA56Gig5TWSCGAX"> We in the Lord’s recovery may substitute the good aspects of our character or behavior for Christ. If anyone who serves the Lord is sinful or proud, others will be frustrated from coming to the Lord. But the natural meekness or humility of such a serving one is even more damaging and frustrating than his sinfulness or pride. Everyone realizes that nothing sinful can be related to Christ. But not many can discern the difference between good character or behavior and Christ Himself. On the contrary, many identify excellent behavior with Christ. Hence, if we are short of revelation, our good character may become a substitute for Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="yrS9bX0cFSGgVgun4Ufhw1Ickdbv_i-F1ONqnoyndBoPJWI5e-rH93nABe6-78JSB"> Because the church is composed of human beings, it is difficult for the church to be separated from society, which is a composition of culture. Yes, as the church, we are separated from the world; we are in the world, but not of the world. However, the church must remain in society. The believers should not live like monks or nuns. In order to <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> have the church life, we must have a normal human living. The issue at hand is how a unit of people can be in society without being influenced by culture. How can we be saved from the influence of our cultural background? As believers in the Lord, we do love one another. Nevertheless, we may have a special love for those with a background similar to ours. Through such an influence operating in the church life, Christ is replaced by culture. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="RfNO2lIzA5Rw54npqQTHNA_TKiM6c9wgvd8yXLZ0NJhLX6FOEZQflozxR78uf33Oy">INTRODUCTION</h1><p data-content-id="sQ-jiCKNjXFon2Sit_5DdVXU4dCLXoqUaRJLlAaDAC4Gkuj3zqfMcEH9tudAOZTWi"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91951" data-verses="Colossians 1:1-8">Colossians 1:1-8</span> is the introduction to this Epistle. As the introduction, these verses disclose the purpose and subject of the book. Paul’s purpose and subject are not stated explicitly, but rather indirectly through various indications to be found in these verses. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wrbcmMjVyCQkgWdRivfLA0DYttkMPq-d3uqzGEffBGQc6UVl06Y-KY2UHVu1-W7x4">THREE INDICATIONS</h2><p data-content-id="LGGjP-PAOdJ8nFxUYQbpLuUq3A8MX8ShMQZw72ekAlg3c478l-zKR4IjWE4Bf53rA"> The first of these indications is the phrase “the hope which is being laid up for you in the heavens” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91952" data-verses="Colossians 1:5">v. 5</span>). Another indication is found in the words “the word of the truth of the gospel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91953" data-verses="Colossians 1:5">v. 5</span>). Notice that here Paul says the word of the truth of the gospel, not simply the word of the gospel. A third indication is seen in the words “fully knew the grace of God in truth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91954" data-verses="Colossians 1:6">v. 6</span>). The word fully is an adverb that modifies the verb knew. What do the words “in truth” modify? According to many versions, this phrase modifies the word grace. Others regard it as an adverb modifying the predicate knew. If we understand truth here as reality, not just as sincerity, then it is correct to regard the words “in truth” as modifying the predicate knew. According to this understanding, Paul is saying that we must know the grace of God in its reality. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mLlsVgAIb-skAhfjqngkuMQK0-huuRA-Eh0Y8vVQpH3WrdTCEmNX27ibG0XFE_F6p">THE HOPE BEING LAID UP FOR US</h2><p data-content-id="ZIaYAIUhlPYkrS-W4qNUAjewVdu-FN35Enf7GKa9aNGLCeSPPJyL_qRbhaKXPVpri"> Let us now consider the hope mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91955" data-verses="Colossians 1:5">verse 5</span>. Hope, faith, and love in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91956" data-verses="Colossians 1:4-5">verses 4 and 5</span> are the three things which the apostle stressed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91957" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:13">1 Corinthians 13:13</span>. The emphasis there was on love because of the Corinthian situation. The emphasis here is on hope, which, strictly speaking, is Christ Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91958" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">v. 27</span>), for the revelation of Christ as everything to us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="A9Ho75-1IEWiI5pZAWtoolFICE6NitwDjip1OYh6Z3Q5wGMSc15rgkFYdiHX9QQ7d"> Some think that the hope that is being laid up for us in the heavens refers to a particular blessing or some kind of glorious enjoyment. When I was young, I was told that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91959" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span>, the Lord Jesus is preparing a wonderful mansion for us in heaven and that this is the hope laid up for us. What a mistake! Our hope is Christ Himself. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91960" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">verse 27</span>, Christ in us is the hope of glory. On the one hand, He is in the heavens, but, on the other hand, He is in us to be our hope. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NvL9nhfr9y1MfkuCnJjWc5-mDmQZRJH-02hvDSNt9dQdENu8DeMorULDAd59B1LCF">FAITH AND LOVE</h2><p data-content-id="t5iqp8-G4gD5mGLTCIR_DHqa6S8d6tluKEbpWrQpW1yZ_muRMBVOIaTGcMROMFrnI"> If we would understand this fully, we need to consider the faith and love spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91961" data-verses="Colossians 1:4">verse 4</span>. Paul says, “Having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and the love which you have unto all the saints.” Faith is to realize and receive what is in Christ, love is to experience and enjoy what we have received of Christ, and hope is to expect and wait for the glorification in Christ. Every genuine Christian has faith in the Lord Jesus and love toward all the saints. These two things prove that we are real Christians. Suppose I contact a certain person and tell him that I am one who believes in the Lord Jesus. If he does not respond to me in love, he himself may not be a genuine believer in the Lord. Love for the saints must always go along with faith in the Lord Jesus. They cannot be divorced. </p>
<p data-content-id="h3ZNAj-7-mNpWfPCijhB17Zq9M7LJTqT5I-hwnsewSx8Ec6pwTMhh2r5WyeY8HZbS"> From the time we first believe in Christ, we spontaneously have love for other believers, no matter what their nationality may be. According to my nature and my background, I could never love the Japanese. When I was a youth, I actually hated them because of the damage Japan had caused to China. But after I had been saved and had entered into the Lord’s ministry, I was invited to visit some Japanese brothers in Manchuria. I attended a small gathering held in the home of a Japanese believer. As soon as I entered into the room, spontaneously a love for those brothers welled up within me. My hatred for the Japanese vanished. Those brothers believed in the Lord Jesus, and I believed in Him also. Therefore, we could love one another as fellow believers <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> in Christ. This love is not a natural love, but a love that comes out of our faith in the Lord Jesus. We have to love all the saints, just as the Colossians loved all the saints, regardless of their nationality and regardless of whether they were Jew or Gentile. </p>
<p data-content-id="U-smkr1a6dFJm6oEW-7auOkFm-HXeIFwUVyMfwU3YgBr5P5j6Up1AlI-ogYff8uiJ"> In the Lord’s recovery there are many nationalities. Humanly speaking, it is impossible for us to be one. However, we praise the Lord that no matter what our nationality may be, we love one another because we all have faith in the Lord Jesus. When I contact brothers from Japan, I do not have any consciousness that they are Japanese brothers and that I am a Chinese brother. On the contrary, I simply have the sense that we are all holy brothers in Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MbvcrlXtA4GGPOZNOvDot4_k7LEO4-YWsRhB1iUfY2NjrQ3EE-RVlAKh7NIKw-9kI">LIVING CHRIST AND LAYING UP HOPE</h2><p data-content-id="Vehc_DxwcgXUMWVvg6ZqRxQAd9WkSJcmilbKcMYbZp13kc_c_BsTJjIrnVSGak81f"> The reason we can love those whom we could never love naturally is that hope is being laid up for us in the heavens. If I had been the writer of Colossians, I would have said “because of the hope in the heavens.” Paul, however, inserted the words “being laid up for you.” This matter of hope being laid up for us in the heavens is actually very subjective. It has very much to do with our daily living. According to the context, the laying up of hope in the heavens has a great deal to do with how we live today. The more we love the saints, the more hope is laid up for us in the heavens. However, if we do not love the saints, there will be very little hope laid up for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="iiCXRFpuXcPrT8Ib2ei9Wmk1Hkpyhe2ws6tpqdIZHirz4qBni4rQoR_fScofdndKl"> Suppose a certain brother loves all the saints, no matter what their nationality or cultural background may be. Another brother, on the contrary, loves the saints selectively, according to his taste and preference. The one loves all who have faith in Christ, whereas the other loves only a select number of the saints. When the Lord Jesus comes, which brother will have the greater hope? Certainly it will be the one who loves all the saints. This indicates that how much hope Christ will be to us depends on our living Christ today. </p>
<p data-content-id="1aJmujdY8zf3BLa1Nx2x7qmP08yUNgu3l_vTi90iiOmndjKLwrW8aLxpNk6UPXsej"> The more we live Christ now, the more hope will be laid up for us in the heavens for our glorification. However, if <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> day by day we do not live Christ, Christ will be there in the heavens, but He will not be laid up as a glory for us. For example, if you deposit a certain amount of the money you earn in the bank, some savings will be laid up for you in your bank account. But if you fail to earn money and have nothing to deposit in the bank, there will be no savings laid up for you. In the same principle, the amount of hope that is being laid up for us in the heavens depends on how much we are living Christ. We need to be those who love the saints without partiality because of the One who is our hope. Such a living is the laying up for ourselves of hope in the heavens. </p>
<p data-content-id="9CMGouSfiMWAlo_AF78CKdna83n81oeYi6ay6JvhbqmWxQR8qwvMZ9jTvWt74Euid"> In this Epistle Paul seemed to be saying, “Dear Colossians, if you follow the Jewish observances or the Gentile ordinances, you will not lay up anything for yourselves in the heavens as a hope. You need to live by Christ. One day, Christ who is our life will appear in glory. At present, both you and Christ are hidden in God. He is your inner life. But He will appear in glory, and you will appear with Him. However, I must warn you of the importance of living by Christ today.” </p>
<p data-content-id="jSqu1fKMETv3AEO0jRP6XSxNGah2bwZ3Bj8ZR-J9t-t3Qs846TNRWzfLsChMbFjod"> Yes, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91962" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">3:4</span> Paul says that Christ is our life and that when Christ is manifested, we shall be manifested with Him in glory. But suppose we do not live by Him; instead we live by the self and by our preferences, loving only those saints who match our taste. To love the saints selectively is to live by the self, not by Christ. If we have this kind of living, we shall not be happy when the Lord Jesus Christ appears in glory. Once again I say that how much we shall enjoy Christ as our hope of glory depends on how much we live Him out today. Therefore, the laying up of the hope in the heavens depends on our living. </p>

I told them that they should seek spiritual knowledge in order to know God’s will. But the will of God here is not focused on things such as marriage, jobs, or housing; it is concerned with the all-inclusive Christ as our portion. The will of God for us is that we know the all-inclusive Christ, experience Him, and live Him as our life. To know Christ in this way is to have the full knowledge of God’s will. <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> </p>

In All Spiritual Wisdom</h2><p data-content-id="aw_owglmYsbhVQpnqDeZZJvwSh1pyIPcebdjcPDhLYFI9FSkEF8RpLBEHkqv-h5U3"> To know and experience the all-inclusive Christ requires all spiritual wisdom and understanding. The words “all” and “spiritual” modify both wisdom and understanding. Spiritual wisdom and understanding are of the Spirit of God in our spirit in contrast to Gnostic philosophy, which is merely in the darkened human mind. Wisdom is in our spirit to perceive God’s eternal will; spiritual understanding is in our mind, renewed by the Spirit, to understand and interpret what we perceive in our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="bII_pa96wW65xpS_TOga8Qb0s0Wg1dUpsR-fiE2GZ2XncQE7FKuNnsp2sqi-cXeIt"> Wisdom is the intuition in our spirit, whereas understanding is the realization in our mind. Through the intuition in our spirit, we sense something concerning Christ. Along with this, we need our mind to interpret what we sense in our spirit in order to have understanding. Then we shall have the utterance to speak forth what we sense and understand. This requires the exercise of all spiritual wisdom and understanding. </p>
<p data-content-id="qcLWvpSjI1XL62hLozF8aNmkee8b7BaDsla5rdBghIZYVZKEAFjA56Gig5TWSCGAX"> The will of God is profound in relation to our knowing, experiencing, and living the all-inclusive Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91983" data-verses="Colossians 1:9">verse 9</span> Paul was not praying that the Colossians would know whom to marry, where to live, or what kind of job they should have. His heart was not occupied with such trivial things. In this verse God’s will refers to Christ. It was not God’s will for the Colossians to follow Judaistic observances, Gentile ordinances, or human philosophies. Furthermore, it was not God’s will for them to practice asceticism, to treat the body severely in order to bridle the indulgence of the flesh. God’s will for the Colossians was to know Christ, to experience Christ, to enjoy Christ, to live Christ, and to have Christ become their life and their person. God’s will for us today is exactly the same. It seems as if Paul was saying, “Colossians, you have been distracted, misled, and defrauded by Gnosticism, mysticism, asceticism, observances, and ordinances. You need to be filled with the full knowledge of God’s will. God’s will is that the all-inclusive Christ be your portion.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="21" id="21">[21]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="yrS9bX0cFSGgVgun4Ufhw1Ickd7v8ieF1ONqnoyndBoPJWI5e-rH93nABe6-78JSB"> If we know that God’s will is for us to be saturated with Christ, then we have the proper knowledge of God’s will. Whatever we do should be done in the will of God. We should marry in Christ, work in Christ, and move in Christ. Christ should be our life and our person. This is the will of God. </p>

If we know that God’s will is for us to be saturated with Christ, to take Christ as our life and our person, and to live Christ, spontaneously our walk will be worthy of the Lord. Some think that to walk worthily of the Lord is to be humble, nice, and generous. However, a worthy walk is a walk in which we live Christ. We can be humble, nice and generous without living by Christ. Only by living out Christ can we walk worthily of the Lord. Christ is the will of God, and He should also be our walk. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91987" data-verses="Galatians 1:15-16">Galatians 1:15 and 16</span> Paul says that it pleased God to reveal Christ, the Son, in him.

<p data-content-id="BOCvS1r-7tIB54EhOvqqTqjp3qEq6Ypvx43xAqzzl996JaIsWLw395nl-aNWe_mB3"> The only time we are fully happy is when we are living Christ. If we are humble or kind in a natural way, we are not happy. But if we take Christ as our life and our person and live Him out, we shall be the happiest people on earth. To live Christ is pleasing not only to the Father, but also to us. The most pleasant thing is to live Christ, to enjoy Christ, and to experience Christ. </p>

Do not understand this according to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> natural concept.

We need such a knowledge in order to live, grow, and produce Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="KavjviC-d0XiSiopL73LYAPbswOJf_ScsRXMlBkeWvyXWct-X5tTcxic3H8-f0epm"> Christ is not only the will of God and our walk, but He is also every good work and even the full knowledge of God.

Empowered with All Power</h2><p data-content-id="OLv1qDRjKPpb7WeQhnpjddP7mT7MVsJE-1ppPPLq1fp8MR8MpzzfwWWMlwmSEija5"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91988" data-verses="Colossians 1:11">verse 11</span> Paul goes on to say, “Empowered with all power, according to the might of His glory, unto all endurance and longsuffering with joy.” This power is not only the power of Christ’s resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91989" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Phil. 3:10</span>), but Christ Himself. Within us we have Christ as a dynamo that continually empowers us “according to the might of His glory.” This is the might that expresses God’s glory; it glorifies God in His might. With this might we are empowered. </p>
<p data-content-id="4IBzwnFeZUmiPTldQylpqjfn_6EuyIBeAumWT0F5vBeYLZvZUxnAH8UtbPcg2OgXO"> By Christ we are empowered “unto all endurance and longsuffering with joy.” Because of this marvelous power, we can be joyful even in sufferings. By means of this power we can take with joy whatever may happen to us. We have reason to be joyful because we have the resurrected Christ as the power within us. If we are joyful during times of affliction, we shall not age so quickly. Instead, we shall look younger than our years. </p>
<p data-content-id="omf13Bx02SFTK6-4sHpHdKgU1amjh_ygyrvnjZRmemRqzlC_dbZvNK2s_tofFhghm"> The Apostle Paul did not pray that the Colossians would have the best husbands or wives, the best houses, and the best jobs. Furthermore, he did not pray that the Colossians would be kept from suffering. To the contrary, he prayed that they would be empowered to all endurance and longsuffering <span class="pg" data-page-id="23" id="23">[23]</span> with joy; that is, he prayed that they would have the capacity to suffer long with joy. To suffer long in joy is to endure suffering in Christ. Suffering may actually help us to have an increased enjoyment of Christ. Christ is the joy, the endurance, and the longsuffering. Therefore, Paul’s prayer is altogether a prayer for the experience of Christ. </p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91997" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>, the Lord charged Paul, “To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the authority of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith that is in me” (Gk.). Both in this verse and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91998" data-verses="Colossians 1:12-13">Colossians 1:12 and 13</span> Paul speaks of darkness, light, authority, those who are sanctified, and the portion or the inheritance. No doubt, Paul’s word to the Colossians reflects the Lord’s word to him at the time of his conversion. </p>
<p data-content-id="zxxKVZo0L_3UdrO9iX46Tdlv1mlHutPB11uoqtjPBjhY_rEsDeSQDqGrA0qATN0ay"> Years ago, I thought that the authority of darkness referred only to evil things such as gambling, stealing, and fornication. Later I realized that the authority of darkness here includes a great deal more than this. In the book of Colossians the authority of darkness refers not to evil things, but to religious observances, Gentile ordinances, and Gnostic philosophy. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91999" data-verses="Colossians 2:1">chapter two</span> Paul linked idolatry, the worship of angels, to philosophy, mysticism, Gnosticism, and asceticism. Asceticism denotes the practice of treating the body severely in order to bridle the indulgence of the flesh. This kind of practice is found in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Catholicism. As we shall see later, asceticism is of no value against the indulgence of the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92000" data-verses="Colossians 2:23">2:23</span>). Religious observances, asceticism, and philosophies are not evil. Some observances are even based on God’s commandments in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="28" id="28">[28]</span> Old Testament; for example, the regulations concerning eating. Nevertheless, when Paul says that the Father has delivered us out of the authority of darkness, he means the darkness of these very observances, ordinances, philosophies, and ascetic practices. All of us regard gambling casinos as under the authority of darkness. But not many think that philosophies or ethical teachings are also part of this authority. Therefore, it is crucial that we understand Paul’s use of this term in the book of Colossians. </p>

Satan’s authority of darkness is the authority of evil in the heavenlies, in the air (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92001" data-verses="Ephesians 6:12">Eph. 6:12</span>). This evil refers to something that is in rebellion against God. The authority of evil, of rebellion, in the heavenlies is the kingdom of Satan, the authority of darkness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92002" data-verses="Matthew 12:26">Matt. 12:26</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="nAAjrYoSxORsKcXED0Y92nk_mPG8eCLYu242cBU-V2b50Voz0s71JJrl7esVgPqMx"> We have seen that the authority of darkness is the kingdom of Satan and that Satan himself is darkness. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="29" id="29">[29]</span> kingdom of Satan is a system. Not everything in this system is evil. On the contrary, many things are good, or at least are considered good by society. Satan uses various things, both good and evil, to systematize people and to keep them in his system. For those who are fond of gambling, Satan uses gambling to systematize them. Therefore, in his kingdom there is a ministry, a department, of gambling. However, Satan realizes that others may appreciate knowledge. In order to systematize them, Satan has a department of knowledge in his kingdom. Most people condemn gambling, but hardly anyone condemns knowledge. If we encourage others to stay away from the evil aspects of Satan’s system, we shall be appreciated. Satan systematizes some people by luring them into practicing evil, but he systematizes others through their efforts to suppress evil. </p>
<p data-content-id="6lc_KG4lpSEXBWvOfF9n73K2HTNBhcKSbKVHRXhoCGalmrzef-H9gsKXflDUdQgSY"> Another department of the kingdom of Satan is the ministry of philosophy. After speaking of the authority of darkness, Paul goes on to mention ordinances, observances, philosophies, and the elements of the world, all of which are aspects of this satanic authority. Today a great many people are held under Satan’s control by philosophy. For this reason, it is often easier to bring a gambler to Christ than a person devoted to philosophy. In China we found it difficult to convert the followers of Confucius. Satan used the ethical teachings of Confucianism to systematize and to control large numbers of Chinese. Satan controlled them and kept them under his authority through ethical philosophy. </p>
<p data-content-id="RfNO2lIzA5Rw54npqQTHNA_TKjs6euAgvd8yXLZ0NJhLX6FOEZQflozxR78uf33Oy"> The Jews and the Moslems vigorously oppose the gospel of Christ. The Moslems are controlled not by evil things, but by the principles of Islam. In a sense, these principles are good; however, in another sense, they are dreadful. </p>
<p data-content-id="sQ-jiCKNjXFon2Sit_5DdVXU4ciLS7qUaRJLlAaDAC4Gkuj3zqfMcEH9tudAOZTWi"> Mormons, who are known to be honest, ethical, and moral in their daily living, also are controlled by seemingly good things. The Mormons not only refrain from drinking alcoholic beverages, but do not even drink coffee or tea. How strict and upright they seem to be! However, Mormonism is part of the authority of darkness, and the Mormons are held and controlled in darkness by Satan. <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="wrbcmMjVyCQkgWdRivfLA0DYtsEML5ud3uqzGEffBGQc6UVl06Y-KY2UHVu1-W7x4"> At the time of Paul, Judaism had become a major part of the authority of darkness. When Paul, a leading religionist in Judaism, was on the road to Damascus, he was fully under this authority. Then the Lord appeared to him and charged him to open the eyes of others so that they might turn from darkness to light. As a result of Paul’s confrontation with Christ, he was blinded temporarily. This blindness indicated that he was formerly among the blind. Now, having been brought to Christ, he must seek to turn others from darkness to light, from the authority of Satan unto God. Before Paul was saved, he was under the authority of Satan. The Jewish religion was the authority of darkness through which Paul was controlled. </p>
<p data-content-id="LGGjP-PAOdJ8nFxUYQbpLuUq3BcMQsyhMQZw72ekAlg3c478l-zKR4IjWE4Bf53rA"> If we would have the proper understanding of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92008" data-verses="Colossians 1:13">Colossians 1:13</span>, we need to consider this verse in the context of the whole Epistle. Considering the book as a whole, we see that the authority of darkness includes the Jewish religion with its observances, especially circumcision; it also includes Gentile ordinances, philosophy, mysticism, and asceticism. Throughout the world today people are under darkness, just as they were when the book of Colossians was written. To be in darkness is simply to be without light. Every university and every social group is under the authority of darkness. Every aspect of society, including Christianity, is in darkness. Do not think that darkness is found only where there is evil. Paul was telling the Colossians that God had delivered them out from under the authority of darkness, that is, out from legalities, ordinances, practices, asceticism, mysticism, and philosophy. Although these include the highest products of culture, they are nonetheless the authority of darkness by which Satan controls people. </p>
<p data-content-id="mLlsVgAIb-skAhfjqngkuMQK0_BuoBw-Eh0Y8vVQpH3WrdTCEmNX27ibG0XFE_F6p"> We need to ask ourselves how much we are still under the authority of darkness. We may talk a lot about living Christ, but how much do we really live by Him? In our daily lives, many of us are still under some aspect of the satanic authority of darkness. Unconsciously, subconsciously, and spontaneously we live according to the self, not according to Christ. How much of each day do you live in the spirit and <span class="pg" data-page-id="31" id="31">[31]</span> walk according to the spirit? How much time do you still live and walk in the self? Whenever we live in the self, we are under the control of the authority of darkness and are systematized by Satan. We are under Satan’s control whenever we are in the natural man or live according to the self. Because of this satanic control, many have the sense that they are in darkness, that they have no light. The reason they are under darkness is that they are still controlled in some way by the authority of darkness. All of mankind, religious and nonreligious ones alike, are in darkness. In this darkness Satan’s authority is exercised in various ways to systematize people and to control them. </p>

<p data-content-id="riqDpjchUDoSOoMli_WZl-Ii0rMFDcNu7gQhs2g1WdrF9hCb4rF0iMESoWGxdqC3t"> In His dealings with the Jewish religionists, the Lord Jesus declared that they were blind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92022" data-verses="Matthew 15:14">Matt. 15:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92023" data-verses="Matthew 23:16">23:16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92024" data-verses="Matthew 23:17">17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92025" data-verses="Matthew 23:19">19</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92026" data-verses="Matthew 23:24">24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92027" data-verses="Matthew 23:26">26</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92028" data-verses="John 12:46">John 12:46</span> the Lord Jesus said, “I have come a light into the world, that every one who believes in Me may not remain in darkness.” The Lord let the people know that without Him they were in darkness. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92029" data-verses="John 8:12">John 8:12</span> He declared, “I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” The Lord’s word here indicates that anyone who does not receive Him as life will not have any light, but will walk in darkness. </p>
<p data-content-id="d9yHx1EHlCF0Nc2ISA4iR70qEY0ByvzQsAr0x-_n5uKwoGhkDJWrhSt-NWfOCM6YO"> The Gospels indicate clearly that the Jewish religion which was formed and constituted according to God’s Word had become darkness. With this darkness there was an authority, the authority identified by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92030" data-verses="Colossians 1:13">Colossians 1:13</span> as the authority of darkness. The Pharisees and priests were under this authority of darkness. In fact, this satanic authority of darkness controlled all of Judaism; it controlled the temple, the priesthood, and even the understanding of the Scriptures. Judaism was altogether under the control of the authority of darkness. In the Gospels this darkness is related not to the Gentile world, but to the Jewish religion, to the religion formed according to the Scriptures. </p>
<p data-content-id="QoYPkMNcmTS0w0HcQG2WFMBh4j5NqMHo00ymhHKS1B0KuZrfvJx-ndqeKB8A9ADgi"> Even more than the four Gospels, the book of Acts reveals that the Jewish religion had become altogether the authority <span class="pg" data-page-id="38" id="38">[38]</span> of darkness under which people were controlled. The Jewish religionists were responsible for casting the apostles into prison and for killing Stephen. Saul of Tarsus was one of these religionists under the control of the authority of darkness. As he was carrying out the will of the authority of darkness through aggressively persecuting those who called on the name of the Lord Jesus, he was confronted by the Lord on the way to Damascus. As Paul testified later, he “saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun” shining round about him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92031" data-verses="Acts 26:13">Acts 26:13</span>). Furthermore, the Lord spoke to him, saying, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92032" data-verses="Acts 26:14">Acts 26:14</span>). Through the shining of this light and the Lord’s speaking, Saul of Tarsus was delivered out of the authority of darkness and was transferred into another realm, a realm of light, which is the kingdom of the Son of God’s love. </p>
<p data-content-id="KavjviC-d0XiSiopL73LYAPbsxuJUtCcsRXMlBkeWvyXWct-X5tTcxic3H8-f0epm"> According to the New Testament, the Son of God is the expression of the divine life and its embodiment. This means that the kingdom of the Son is a realm of life. The fact that the kingdom into which we have been transferred is the kingdom of the Son of God’s love indicates that this realm of life is in love, not in fear. The kingdom in which we find ourselves today is a realm full of life, light, and love. </p>
<p data-content-id="BOCvS1r-7tIB54EhOvqqTqjp3rkq6apvx43xAqzzl996JaIsWLw395nl-aNWe_mB3"> Just as the Jewish religion has become a part of the authority of darkness, so the church also has fallen under the prevailing authority of darkness. Degradation began to take place not long after the church had come into existence. In 1 Corinthians we see evil things such as division, fornication, and lawsuits. Colossians, on the contrary, deals not with sinful things, but with religion, observances, ordinances, and philosophy. Although the saints in Colosse did not fall into evil things, they did come under the authority of darkness by allowing the highest products of culture to invade the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="xhOwCJPMz8poSokM7QjIveWcXVVv-VtC3D97biFQx_aZezgsPp4uXJaG_Tl_jpc6R"> As he was writing the Epistle to the Colossians, Paul seemed to be saying, “Dear saints at Colosse, before I believed in Christ, I spent years under the authority of darkness in Judaism. But one day I was delivered out of that authority and transferred into the kingdom of the Son of God’s love. Through the preaching of the gospel, you also <span class="pg" data-page-id="39" id="39">[39]</span> have been delivered out of the authority of darkness and transferred into the same wonderful realm that I am in. Why then have you gone back to the very things from which you have been delivered? You have returned to the Jewish religion and Greek philosophy. You have once again come under those concepts that used to control your thought and life in the past. This means you are now under the very authority of darkness from which you have been delivered. You have been carried off as a spoil, as a prey. Why do you still observe new moons, Sabbaths, and regulations concerning eating and drinking? Don’t you know all that is the authority of darkness?” Paul knew that the saints in Colosse had again fallen under the satanic authority of darkness. </p>
<p data-content-id="riqDpjchUDoSOoMli_WZl-Ii0rMFEONu7gQhs2g1WdrF9hCb4rF0iMESoWGxdqC3t"> In the same principle, the Catholic Church, the Protestant denominations, and the various independent Christian groups are to a certain extent under the authority of darkness today. They are in darkness because for the most part they have Christ in name, but not in reality. Christ is the unique light. Apart from Him, there is no light. The reason so many Christians are in darkness is that they do not have Christ in an experiential way. Those in the seminaries may study theology and Christology, but they may not have the genuine experience of God and of Christ. Therefore, they are without light. </p>
<p data-content-id="d9yHx1EHlCF0Nc2ISA4iR70qEY0B09jQsAr0x-_n5uKwoGhkDJWrhSt-NWfOCM6YO"> Many believers insist that the Bible is full of light. This, of course, is true. But if we do not read the Word in the Lord’s presence, even our reading of the Scriptures will be in darkness. We shall be like the Pharisees addressed by the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92033" data-verses="John 5:39">John 5:39</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92034" data-verses="John 5:40">40</span>: “You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life, and it is these that testify concerning Me; and you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.” It is possible to have the Bible in our hand and yet still be blind and in darkness. The religionists were offended when Christ told them they were blind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92035" data-verses="John 9:39-41">John 9:39-41</span>). They thought they were in light because they had the Scriptures in an outward way. But actually they were blind because they did not have Christ, who alone is the light of the world. Any place where the Lord Jesus is not present is under the authority of darkness. <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="QoYPkMNcmTS0w0HcQG2WFMBh4j5Njfno00ymhHKS1B0KuZrfvJx-ndqeKB8A9ADgi"> We need to apply this principle to ourselves. Any part of our being or of our daily life that is without Christ is in darkness. If we in the Lord’s recovery do not have Christ experientially and in a practical way in our daily walk, we are in darkness. Do not think simply because you hear so many messages and teachings you are in the light. It is very possible that you are still in darkness. </p>
<p data-content-id="KavjviC-d0XiSiopL73LYAPbsxuJc-ycsRXMlBkeWvyXWct-X5tTcxic3H8-f0epm"> For example, we may still be under the authority of darkness in our married life. When a brother is exchanging words with his wife, both he and his wife are in darkness. Because they are in darkness, they accuse and blame each other. The same is true when there are arguments between brothers or between sisters. Our experience testifies that whenever we live, walk, and behave in the self, we are in darkness. There is no need to commit some gross sin in order to be in darkness. Simply living according to the self puts us in darkness, for it causes us to be separated from Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="lGebDchapj8MhaQa-6qJi3EWnzP6DDoIEBHfdfUryVbKKL4PAwixxjPTbBKYDu4Le"> We should never think that darkness prevails only in Judaism, in Catholicism, or in the denominations and divisions, but not in us. It is possible that we ourselves may still be under the authority of darkness. Whenever we are in the natural man, not taking Christ as our person and living by Him, we are in darkness. We must remember that He alone is light. He must saturate and prevail in every aspect of our daily living. Otherwise, at least certain parts of our daily walk will not be filled with Christ, and those parts of our life will be in darkness. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92062" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">1:12</span> Paul says, “Giving thanks to the Father, Who qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.” As we shall see, the portion of the saints is the all-inclusive Christ for our enjoyment. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="c33eAwsfVfXraWL3f3puOBKwufqxVtNqYFcEXib3Lo6hB_NVq0ahbWwl2qspOIzbJ">THE PROMISE OF THE LAND</h2><p data-content-id="YHo9_4F4rbtTN6uJrNVKlcVHcaJwc-UIM1JeaWPCErK8lD8OYCz-gEq8DCxiWamqp"> According to the book of Genesis, no promises were given that involved blessing or enjoyment before the call of Abraham. Of course, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92063" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span> there is the promise that the seed of the woman would crush the head of the serpent. This promise, however, does not involve a promise of blessing or enjoyment. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92064" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">chapters four through eleven</span> of Genesis there is no record of such a promise. A promise of blessing is first mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92065" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span>, at the time God called Abraham out of his country and his father’s house. Here the Lord specifically mentions the land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92066" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Gen. 12:1</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Ekj8KtyS_lkUZoS96keszutDi3o6LkQcNJn28_oNc3vFOaI1hUNqhE5B4RkV_HSQJ"> We may be familiar with the story of Abraham and assume that we understand everything related to it. As we read of God’s calling of Abraham and of the promises made to him, we may take things for granted. Thus, when we read about the land, we may have no impression of its significance. However, if we read the Word carefully, we shall surely realize that God’s promise to Abraham concerning the land is striking and very important. This promise made in Genesis is a seed that grows and develops throughout the Old Testament. In a very real sense, apart from the first eleven chapters of Genesis, the entire Old Testament is a story about the land of Canaan. The subject of the Old Testament is this good land, the land <span class="pg" data-page-id="48" id="48">[48]</span> flowing with milk and honey. Nevertheless, few Christians pay adequate attention to this. </p>
<p data-content-id="DoDlSswZom_4i2OTnuzO3QHEE5sZ_AJ-vevsKnj9CyhxI_r5snfUvFBDoS7HJ6EHS"> When I was with the Brethren, I was encouraged to study typology and prophecy. However, three important matters were not brought to my attention, and I received no help with respect to them. These three matters were God’s creation of man in His own image, after His likeness, and with His dominion; the tree of life, the river with the precious materials, and the bride built from Adam’s rib; and the promise of the good land. Only after I had been a Christian for years did I begin to focus my attention on these things. Those familiar with my messages realize that, in one way or other, they deal with these three things. </p>
<p data-content-id="LGGjP-PAOdJ8nFxUYQbpLuUq3B8MQuyhMQZw72ekAlg3c478l-zKR4IjWE4Bf53rA"> God’s promise to Abraham with respect to the good land is of great significance. When Paul was writing the Epistle to the Colossians and was speaking of the portion of the saints, he no doubt had in mind the picture of the allotting of the good land to the children of Israel in the Old Testament. The Greek word rendered portion in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92067" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">1:12</span> can be also rendered lot. Paul used this term with the Old Testament record of the land as the background. God gave His chosen people, the children of Israel, the good land for their inheritance and enjoyment. The land meant everything to them. In fact, the question of the land is a serious issue in the Middle East even today. The problem in the Middle East regarding Israel and the surrounding nations is a problem of the land. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mLlsVgAIb-skAhfjqngkuMQK0_huoDw-Eh0Y8vVQpH3WrdTCEmNX27ibG0XFE_F6p">THE SEED AND THE LAND</h2><p data-content-id="ZIaYAIUhlPYkrS-W4qNUAjewVcu-Mf35Enf7GKa9aNGLCeSPPJyL_qRbhaKXPVpri"> The promise to Adam and Eve in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92068" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> was the promise of the seed of the woman. But the promise God made to Abraham was not only that of the seed, but also that of the land. The seed promised in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92069" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span> becomes the land in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92070" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span>. When the children of Israel entered into the land of Canaan, they inherited not only the seed, but also the land. We may interpret the seed both as a person and also as a seed sown into soil. This means that Christ is not only a descendant, but a seed sown into the land. Christ is both the seed and the land. <span class="pg" data-page-id="49" id="49">[49]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="A9Ho75-1IEWiI5pZAWtoolFICF6Nq_gDjip1OYh6Z3Q5wGMSc15rgkFYdiHX9QQ7d"> In Colossians do we have Christ as the seed or the land? In this book Christ is both the seed and the land. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92071" data-verses="Colossians 2:7">Colossians 2:7</span> says that we have been rooted in Christ. This indicates that He is the land. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92072" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">3:4</span> we are told that Christ is our life. This indicates that He is also the seed. However, in Colossians Christ is revealed more as the land than as the seed. Christ is our portion, our lot, our everything, just as the land was all things to the children of Israel. The land provided whatever the children of Israel needed: milk, honey, water, cattle, grain, minerals. In writing this Epistle, Paul employed the concept of the all-inclusive land in order to charge the misled Colossians not to take anything other than Christ Himself. Anything that is not Christ is related to the authority of darkness, and we should not accept it. Rather, we should simply remain in the good land and not allow any foreign element to come in. Christ alone is our portion, and we should accept only what is of Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="F8T5SrvVvSK9adYDT1faMIT2uJkYTdOvvK68nXJGmPygBYfXAuqVH6_7nXxzbpNoL">THE SPIRIT BEING THE GOOD LAND</h2><p data-content-id="CV0IHBXEspCOWkPgBxpK-FPjsQ64Kv12YOitnjJYe71lPdJfo-RTTzkzgsHXnVKBu"> Before Paul wrote Colossians, he wrote the Epistle to the Galatians. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92073" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">Galatians 3:14</span> he says, “That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.” Some Christian teachers believe that the blessing of Abraham refers to justification by faith. According to the context, however, this blessing must refer to the good land. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92074" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span> the blessing God promised to give Abraham was the land. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92075" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">Galatians 3:14</span> Paul links the blessing of Abraham to the promise of the Spirit. This indicates that the promise of Abraham, the promise of the good land, is the Spirit. Hence, the Spirit is the good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="P48e1Zv0yLRjkEdD3vDxRlw0sw9xDASsNs7_pSaWHLCXEoMkdyKlIfpN-GyxhQQiF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92076" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">Galatians 3:14</span> Paul speaks of the Spirit. This should remind us of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92077" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span>. This verse says, “The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” The Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92078" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">Galatians 3:14</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92079" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span> is the ultimate expression of the Triune God. The Spirit is a unique term which denotes the processed God. The Father is the source. The Son of God as the course was incarnated, lived on earth, was crucified, <span class="pg" data-page-id="50" id="50">[50]</span> and on the third day was resurrected. Incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection are all aspects of a process. In resurrection, Christ, the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92080" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92081" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, the Word, who was God, became flesh. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92082" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span>, the last Adam, who is Christ, became the life-giving Spirit. Many Christian teachers argue that the life-giving Spirit in this verse is not the Holy Spirit. To believe this is to believe that there are two Spirits who can give life, the Holy Spirit and the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is no doubt the very Holy Spirit who gives life. This Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed God. This Spirit is nothing less than the all-inclusive Christ. As the good land is an all-inclusive type of Christ, and as Christ has become the Spirit, so the Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit as the processed God, is eventually the good land to us, the New Testament believers, as a fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham that all the nations of the earth would be blessed in him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92083" data-verses="Genesis 12:3">Gen. 12:3</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="-8P5_We9HlrZyO3mbt2-Dnw2_Gxjn2ZMPtZfEzTH8mFI2NJZdM2qdWpYHt1XsAb0_"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92084" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">Galatians 3:14</span>, the promise is the promise of the Spirit. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92085" data-verses="Galatians 3:16">Galatians 3:16</span> says that the promises were made to Abraham’s seed, which is Christ. It is difficult to reconcile these verses. On the one hand, the Spirit is the all-inclusive Christ. On the other hand, this promise, this Spirit, was given to Christ as the seed. Although this is difficult to explain doctrinally, it is rather easy to understand according to experience. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received Him as the seed, as life. However, this seed is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, the reality of the good land. This means that the very Christ whom we received as the seed is the Spirit typified by the good land. Christ came into us as the seed. But as we live by Him, He becomes the land which is our portion. </p>

In this message we need to consider what it is to partake of Christ, the portion of the saints, in the light. </p>
<p data-content-id="h3ZNAj-7-mNpWfPCijhB17Zq9NrLOBqT5I-hwnsewSx8Ec6pwTMhh2r5WyeY8HZbS"> The Bible reveals that when God restored the universe He had judged because of the rebellion of Satan, the first thing He did was to cause light to appear. Darkness had been on the surface of the deep. Then God said, “Let there be light,” and light came forth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92105" data-verses="Genesis 1:3">Gen. 1:3</span>). This took place on the first day. On the fourth day we see a more solid form of light: the sun, the moon, and the stars. The light on the first day was rather abstract and unsubstantial, but on the fourth day we have the solid luminaries. By this we see that the re-creation of the universe, or its restoration, was carried out by light. </p>
<p data-content-id="U-smkr1a6dFJm6oEW-7auOkFm_XXYaVwUVyMfwU3YgBr5P5j6Up1AlI-ogYff8uiJ"> References to light abound in the Old Testament. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92106" data-verses="Psalms 36:9">Psalm 36:9</span> says, “In thy light shall we see light.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92107" data-verses="Psalms 119:105">Psalm 119:105</span> the psalmist declares, “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92108" data-verses="Isaiah 2:5">Isaiah 2:5</span> says, “O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.” </p>

Light is real and substantial, yet it is mysterious. Nevertheless, the Bible indicates that light was a basic factor in the restoration of <span class="pg" data-page-id="56" id="56">[56]</span> the universe and that light is necessary for God’s people to walk in His presence. </p>

However, if we do not follow Him as the light, we shall be in darkness. Furthermore, at the time of Paul’s conversion, the Lord Jesus told him to open the eyes of people so that they may turn from darkness to light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92111" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>). This indicates that unbelievers, whether Jews or Gentiles, are in darkness. Anyone who does not believe in the Lord Jesus is in darkness and needs to turn from darkness to light. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92112" data-verses="1John 1:5">1 John 1:5</span> says that God is light and that in Him there is no darkness.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92120" data-verses="Philippians 2:15">Philippians 2:15</span> Paul says that the believers “shine as lights in the world.” The Greek for lights is better rendered luminaries. A luminary does not have light in itself; it reflects light that comes from another source. The believers are luminaries. In ourselves we have no light. The light comes from the oil, the Spirit, burning within us. The source of our light is not ourselves, but Christ as the Spirit. </p>

The lamp is Christ with God in Him as light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92122" data-verses="Revelation 21:23">Rev. 21:23</span>). In the universe there is one light, God Himself. The Triune God is the unique light. </p>

Since God alone is light, we must turn to God and be in His presence in order to <span class="pg" data-page-id="58" id="58">[58]</span> partake of Christ. We have been called into the marvelous light of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92124" data-verses="1Peter 2:9">1 Pet. 2:9</span>). Before we were saved, we were altogether in darkness. Everything related to us and our human situation was in darkness. When the gospel came to us, it came with light. This caused us to repent to God. As we repented, we spontaneously opened to Him. At the time we repented and were saved, we experienced something shining within us. We believed in the Lord Jesus and thanked Him for dying on our behalf, and we received Him as our Savior and Lord. In this way, the inner shining was intensified. Therefore, at the time of our conversion, light entered into us. Many of us can testify that in the days following our conversion we experienced such a light. In that light Christ became our portion. Although we did not have this kind of knowledge at the time, we did have this experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="MbvcrlXtA4GGPOZNOvDot4_k7KUO7-4WsRhB1iUfY2NjrQ3EE-RVlAKh7NIKw-9kI"> However, after we were saved, we were distracted from this inner shining. Many of us were encouraged by diligent Christian workers to pay attention to doctrine and Bible teaching. Hence, instead of remaining in the presence of the Lord and treasuring the inner shining, we turned to good things that are not Christ Himself. We exchanged the presence of Christ for doctrine, for some type of observance or practice, and thereby lost the inner shining. The result was that once again we were in darkness. Before we were saved, we were in the horrible darkness of the world. But after we were saved, we were in the darkness of teachings, observances, works, formalities, and religious rituals. Some of these things may be good, but they are not Christ Himself. Having been distracted from God as the light, we lost the enjoyment of Christ as our portion. </p>
<p data-content-id="Vehc_DxwcgXUMWVvg6ZqRxQAd8GkRJ8milbKcMYbZp13kc_c_BsTJjIrnVSGak81f"> In more than fifty years of contacting Christians, it has been hard to find any who speak of the enjoyment of Christ. Do you know of Christians who testify of Christ as their portion and who encourage others to partake of Christ and to enjoy Him? When I was young, I was taught to follow Christ and to walk in His steps. I was also charged to worship Him as the Lord and Master in the heavens. But I was never told <span class="pg" data-page-id="59" id="59">[59]</span> that I could enjoy Christ. I was not taught that Christ is my life supply and the portion for my enjoyment. </p>

The main purpose of the book of Colossians is to show that Christ is everything, that He is all. In the universe everything that exists is included under one of two basic headings: the Creator and the creation. In order to show us that Christ is all, the Bible tells us that Christ is both the Creator and the firstborn of all creation. If He were only the Creator but not the firstborn of creation, then He would not be all. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6lc_KG4lpSEXBWvOfF9n73K2HQNBmPqSbKVHRXhoCGalmrzef-H9gsKXflDUdQgSY">THE HERESY OF ANGEL WORSHIP</h2><p data-content-id="RfNO2lIzA5Rw54npqQTHNA_TKgs6Y9wgvd8yXLZ0NJhLX6FOEZQflozxR78uf33Oy"> In Colossians Paul deals with such things as Jewish observances, Gentile ordinances, mysticism, Gnosticism, and asceticism. Of all the negative things that he deals with, one stands out as especially serious—the worship of angels, which is a form of idolatry. To worship anything other than God, including such creatures as angels, is idolatry. Nevertheless, because they regarded themselves and others as being unworthy to contact God directly, certain heretical teachers in Colosse advocated angel worship. They taught that God is very high and that we are very low, that God is glorious and that man is corrupt. Therefore, according to their heretical teaching, we could not be worthy to contact God directly. According to them, we must have some kind of intermediary. These teachers said that the angels are the intermediaries between us and God. This was the concept behind the angel worship that had invaded the church in Colosse. <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="sQ-jiCKNjXFon2Sit_5DdVXU4fiLboqUaRJLlAaDAC4Gkuj3zqfMcEH9tudAOZTWi"> The angel worship Paul dealt with in this Epistle was related to a sense of humility. Some thought it was a sign of humility to believe that they were not worthy to worship God directly. Apparently they had some ground in the Bible for their position. The Bible records that the law was not given to Moses by God directly; it was given through the mediation of angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92136" data-verses="Galatians 3:19">Gal. 3:19</span>). Hence, in the giving of the law the angels functioned as intermediaries. The heretical teachers went on to say that the angels should be the intermediaries between God and fallen man. They encouraged the saints to show humility by following this way of worship. It seems as if these teachers were telling those in Colosse, “You shouldn’t be so proud as to think that you can go directly to God. You must humble yourselves and recognize your need of angels to serve as intermediaries between you and God.” Paul was fighting against such a concept when he said, “Let no one purposely defraud you of your prize, in humility and worship of the angels” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92137" data-verses="Colossians 2:18">2:18</span>). We should not be carried away by someone’s humility or by a teaching regarding angel worship. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wrbcmMjVyCQkgWdRivfLA0DYtvEMDq-d3uqzGEffBGQc6UVl06Y-KY2UHVu1-W7x4">THE HEAD OF ALL RULE AND AUTHORITY</h2><p data-content-id="piRKMgn5tqXQZ3-2TvISTCkGItA07R5jTePG4ht9Tcd7P32I3OUf8n-_v44p36SzH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92138" data-verses="Colossians 2:9-10">2:9 and 10</span> Paul says, “For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you in Him are made full, Who is the Head of all rule and authority.” The words rule and authority refer to the angels. Christ is the Head of all the angels, not only of subordinate angels, but of those angels that have rule, power, and authority. </p>
<p data-content-id="vIx9uQjmeEwOiVEgDgH8y0xEbdw03NyCYgINrThFa0OoCG1Z0wmuhOJ40BCNUJHpK"> We need to see why Paul inserts the phrase in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92139" data-verses="Colossians 2:10">2:10</span>, “Who is the Head of all rule and authority.” It is rather easy for us to understand that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily, that is, in bodily form (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92140" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">2:9</span>). When Christ was on earth, He had a physical body, and in that body all the fullness of the Godhead dwelt. Because the fullness dwells in Him and because we are in Him, it follows that in Him we are made full (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92141" data-verses="Colossians 2:10">2:10</span>). But then Paul suddenly speaks of Christ being the Head of all rule and authority. The One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells and the One in whom we <span class="pg" data-page-id="65" id="65">[65]</span> are made full is the very Head of all rule and authority. It is crucial that we see the significance of this. </p>
<p data-content-id="W0UKyOT0t1IBxSIccUYMsUMOlTLZ3d_JmT-k52DOjH1qiyrn6ODlKeTuGk-ooeEF4"> In order to understand the insertion of this clause, we need to consider it in the context of the whole book. Colossians reveals that Christ is all. Paul emphasized this to the Colossians because they had accepted the heresy of angel worship. Apparently the saints in Colosse did not think that Christ could be the intermediary between them and God. To their concept, Christ was too exalted to help them in this way. Hence, they felt they needed angels as intermediaries. This was the reason Paul told them that Christ is the Head of all angels. As long as we have Christ, who is everything, there is no need for us to rely on angels. If we need an intermediary, Christ is our intermediary. This is not the function of angels. Yes, God is high, and we are very low. But this does not mean that we need angels as intermediaries. In Christ we have been made full; we are short of nothing. Because the Colossians were regarding angels as intermediaries, they needed to see that Christ is the Head of all the angels. Christ is everything. As long as they had Him, they had been made full. Both doctrinally and experientially, we should be able to testify that in Christ we have been made full and are short of nothing. In Christ we have God, righteousness, life, and all the positive things in the whole universe. By having Christ we have the One who is the Head of all angels. How mistaken the Colossians were in accepting the heresy of angel worship! Because Christ is all, we should go to Him for everything we need. Now we see that Paul added a clause in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92142" data-verses="Colossians 2:10">2:10</span> in order to impress the Colossians with the fact that we do not need angels as intermediaries because our Christ is the Head of all rule and authority. He is the Head of all angels. </p>
<p data-content-id="2KhgJ0DuKwQnI2lO6O2N5dgXuc7pahtkMP3qeHnY675TwiRdcLBNxgl-yEWidZOr3"> Colossians reveals that Christ is everything, both the Creator and the firstborn of all creation. If Christ were only the Creator but not anything of the creation, He would not be all. Thus, the fullness, the expression of the Triune God, would not be complete. Paul’s concept in Colossians is profound. The fullness, the full expression of the Triune God, <span class="pg" data-page-id="66" id="66">[66]</span> dwells in Christ. As the One who is all, He is both the Creator and the firstborn of all creation. This is a basic principle. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="uei5QW3MGv90tAA2FxD3LJZfaPn-F5R75QFjeBrVrSzVrCFjdoepppbzqxBliOuF8">THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="f5FHReDvsyzvBMFzyvsIslz0SMllMZqgmUB6rb4-E6X-5JRriI2ZE461KcHMoNa9f"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92143" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Colossians 1:15</span> says that Christ is the “image of the invisible God.” Then, in the very same verse, Paul says that Christ is the “firstborn of all creation.” Why does he put these two matters together, the image of the invisible God and the firstborn of all creation? God is invisible. But the Son of His love, “the effulgence of His glory and the express image of His substance” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92144" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">Heb. 1:3</span>), is His image, expressing what He is. The image here does not mean a physical form, but an expression of God’s being in all His attributes and virtues. This interpretation is confirmed by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92145" data-verses="Colossians 3:10">Colossians 3:10</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92146" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ij7bPPSnYgJ7k5YLk7p3WF7OEtk49iispqhi6sQh09yxxcsmTBisNQ0qrwyEIQciJ"> To say that Christ, the all-inclusive One, is the image of God implies that He is the very God, the Creator. When we see Christ, we see the expression of the invisible God, for He Himself is God. If I had written the Epistle to the Colossians, I would have said simply that Christ is God the Creator. Paul, however, did not write in such a simple way. He said that Christ is the image of the invisible God, God Himself expressed. </p>

Through resurrection He was begotten as the Son of God. However, before His <span class="pg" data-page-id="72" id="72">[72]</span> incarnation, in eternity, He was already the Son of God. Why then did He need to be born the Son of God in resurrection? Before His incarnation, Christ was not a man. He was simply the infinite, eternal God. But in the fullness of time, Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit in the womb of Mary, and nine months later He was born in a manger in Bethlehem. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92164" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, the Word who is Christ became flesh. This means that He took the step of becoming a man. How marvelous that through incarnation the infinite, eternal God became a man! However, in becoming man, He did not cease to be God. </p>

Then in resurrection He took a second step to be born the second time and become the firstborn Son of God. Before His resurrection, Christ was the only begotten Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92165" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>). But through resurrection the only begotten Son became the firstborn among many brothers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92166" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Rom. 8:29</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92167" data-verses="Hebrews 2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>, God is leading many sons into glory.

By the incarnation of Christ God was brought into man. Prior to Christ’s incarnation, God was outside of man. However, through Christ’s incarnation God was brought into humanity. We may say that with the birth of Christ God was born into man. Therefore, by Christ’s first birth in incarnation God was brought into man and became one with man. Then through Christ’s resurrection man was brought into God. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, God was living in a man, for God was in Him. Now, through Christ’s resurrection, man has been brought into God. Hallelujah, as a man Christ is in the heavens! God has been brought into man, and man has been brought into God. What a transaction! What marvelous two-way traffic!

Some teach the truth that Christ is both God and man. Others, however, teach that Christ is God, but not man or that He is man, but not God. There is no need for disputes concerning the Person of Christ. He is all-inclusive. He is God, man, and the reality of every positive thing in the universe. If we <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> see that Christ is everything, we shall not argue about Him. A number of verses indicate clearly that Christ is God. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92171" data-verses="Romans 9:5">Romans 9:5</span> speaks of “Christ, Who is over all, God blessed forever.” At a certain time Christ became a man. Then through death and resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92174" data-verses="John 14:1-16">John 14 through 16</span> the disciples were troubled by the fact that the Lord was leaving them. It seems that He was telling them, “If I do not go, there will be no way for Me to come into you. I must pass through death and resurrection in order to become the life-giving Spirit. Then I shall be in you forever.” On the day of His resurrection, the Lord appeared to the disciples, breathed into them, and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92175" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>). This is the Spirit promised in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92176" data-verses="John 14:16-17">14:16-17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92177" data-verses="John 14:26">26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92178" data-verses="John 15:26">15:26</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92179" data-verses="John 16:7">16:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92180" data-verses="John 16:13">13</span>. The Lord’s breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter. By breathing the Spirit, the holy breath, the life-giving Spirit, into the disciples, the Lord imparted Himself into them as life and every positive thing. </p>

<p data-content-id="XqFwK4-uCOxRvgyEbG31TFRJeAHgJjVv26KaLLx9rvafbSffqSmEd1W12EaU8vYF3"> In the traditional teaching prevailing in Christianity, Christ is considered to be the Creator. Although as God Christ is the Creator, no verse in the Bible says explicitly that Christ created the heavens, the earth, and all the things in the universe. When some hear this, they may wonder about <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92193" data-verses="John 1:3">John 1:3</span>. This verse says, “All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being.” This verse does not say that Christ created all things. It says that all things came into existence through Christ. The King James Version of this verse says, “All things were made by him.” This, however, is not an accurate translation. The Greek preposition should be rendered through and not by. Hence, this verse does not say that all things were created by Christ, but that all things came into existence through Christ. This indicates that Christ is the means of creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="kX1nUfZuqQkzrLrgt3NFkih8mAxwWluJ9RDPm9pQmA9VJDK3iAAZbqak9qWDfH_Sw"> Some may think that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92194" data-verses="Hebrews 1:10-12">Hebrews 1:10-12</span> says that Christ is the Creator. However, these verses are a quotation from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92195" data-verses="Psalms 102:1">Psalm 102</span> that indicates that God is the Creator. Here they are quoted to prove that Christ is God. </p>
<p data-content-id="J_nFMNQorB6p2GT8JBzVIJEJghtRBLNHJ9mfOn7jgTGQpHDcX8vywWDQZdhqUypmp"> Christ is in fact the Creator of all things. But the point we are emphasizing here is that the Bible does not say specifically that Christ is the Creator. Rather, the Bible speaks of Christ as the means of creation, as the means through which all things came into being. If we speak of creation in a general sense, it is correct to say that Christ is the Creator. But if we wish to speak more definitely, it is better to say that Christ is the means of creation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="zxxKVZo0L_3UdrO9iX46Tdlv0nlHitPB11uoqtjPBjhY_rEsDeSQDqGrA0qATN0ay"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92196" data-verses="Colossians 1:16">Colossians 1:16</span> says, “In Him were all things created.” The King James Version says, “By him were all things created.” This rendering is not accurate. The Greek preposition used here is more accurately translated by the English word in. To say that all things were created in Christ indicates that He is the means of the creation of all things. However, if this verse is rendered, “By him were all things created,” it will say that Christ is the Creator, not the means of creation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XqFwK4-uCOxRvgyEbG31TFRJeAHgOx1v26KaLLx9rvafbSffqSmEd1W12EaU8vYF3">CHRIST EXPRESSING GOD IN CREATION</h2><p data-content-id="kX1nUfZuqQkzrLrgt3NFkih8mAxwQ3eJ9RDPm9pQmA9VJDK3iAAZbqak9qWDfH_Sw"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92197" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">1:15</span> Paul says that Christ is the image of the invisible God. This means that Christ is the expression of the unseen God. At this point we need to ask in what way Christ expresses God. The answer is that He expresses God in creation. However, Christ does not express God in creation simply by creating all things in an objective way. If Christ were merely an objective Creator, not the subjective means of creation, Christ could not express God in creation. Keep in mind that all things were created not by Christ, but through Christ. This points to a process that took place in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="J_nFMNQorB6p2GT8JBzVIJEJghtRIZNHJ9mfOn7jgTGQpHDcX8vywWDQZdhqUypmp"> In his note on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92198" data-verses="Colossians 1:16">Colossians 1:16</span> in his New Translation, J. N. Darby says that the words “in Him” mean in the power of Christ’s Person. As Darby says, “He was the one whose intrinsic power characterized the creation.” Commenting on the meaning of the Greek preposition used in the phrase “in Him were all things created,” Darby says that it is “used generally for the character in which a thing is done” (<em>Collected Writings,</em> Vol. 33, p. 87). He also states that the “creation of all things was characterized and wrought by the inherent power which is in the Lord Jesus Christ, and all things subsist together as one ordered and law-governed whole by the same constant and inherent power” (<em>Collected Writings,</em> Vol. 31, p. 188). </p>
<p data-content-id="zxxKVZo0L_3UdrO9iX46Tdlv0nlHq_fB11uoqtjPBjhY_rEsDeSQDqGrA0qATN0ay"> Christ is the active instrument through which creation was processed. In this process God’s power is expressed; it is made manifest. This is revealed clearly in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92199" data-verses="Romans 1:20">Romans 1:20</span>. <span class="pg" data-page-id="81" id="81">[81]</span> This verse says that the “invisible things of Him from the creation of the world, being apprehended by the things made, are clearly seen, both His eternal power and divine nature.” In all created things God’s power is made manifest. Hence, in Darby’s words, creation bears the characteristics of Christ’s intrinsic power. </p>

Christ did not create the universe merely in an objective way as an objective Creator. He did not, so to speak, stand apart and call everything into being. On the contrary, the process of creation took place in Him, that is, in the power of His Person. Christ is the unique power in the universe. His very Person is this power. Therefore, creation was processed in Him. This means that He was not simply an objective Creator, but also the subjective instrument through which creation was processed. For this reason, creation bears the characteristics of Christ’s intrinsic power. Instead of saying that Christ created the universe, the Bible says that all things came into being through Him or were created in Him. The words “by Him” are objective, whereas the words “through Him” and “in Him” are subjective. </p>
<p data-content-id="qcLWvpSjI1XL62hLozF8aNmkfeMb7AaDsla5rdBghIZYVZKEAFjA56Gig5TWSCGAX"> The use of gasoline as the source of power in an automobile may be a helpful illustration. An automobile is operated by the driver, but it receives its power supply from gasoline. Since gasoline provides the power, an automobile bears the characteristics of the power of gasoline. But gasoline does not supply an automobile as an objective power; it empowers it subjectively by operating within certain mechanical parts of the automobile. If the power of gasoline were objective, an automobile would not bear the characteristics of the intrinsic power of gasoline. But since gasoline is subjectively related to the automobile, the vehicle driven by it bears the characteristics of its intrinsic power. </p>
<p data-content-id="yrS9bX0cFSGgVgun4Ufhw1IcldLv8jeF1ONqnoyndBoPJWI5e-rH93nABe6-78JSB"> The King James Version of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92200" data-verses="Colossians 1:16">Colossians 1:16</span> says that all things have been created for Him. It is better to render the Greek “unto Him.” “For Him” is objective, but “unto Him” is <span class="pg" data-page-id="82" id="82">[82]</span> subjective. All things have been created in Christ, through Christ, and, ultimately, unto Christ. These expressions indicate that Christ has a subjective relationship to creation. Creation is not simply for Him; it is also unto Him. This means that it consummates in Him. The three prepositions in, through, and unto were used by Paul to point out the subjective relationship of Christ to creation. Creation took place in the power of Christ’s Person, through Him as the active instrument, and unto Him as its consummation. Such a relationship is altogether subjective. Because of His subjective relationship to creation, Christ expresses God in creation. Creation expresses the characteristics of Christ who is the image of the invisible God. </p>

<p data-content-id="7cuojx9EnikxgkGvSa0_PvMZPlB3fNk5yo0N_UaqITA8UbezEJgBcuGWFgD9_1aau"> It is important to differentiate between the words exist, consist, and subsist. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92202" data-verses="Colossians 1:17">Colossians 1:17</span> does not say that all things exist in Christ or consist in Him; it says that all things subsist in Him. To exist is to be, to consist is to be composed or constituted, and to subsist is to hold together for existence. Imagine a wheel with its rim, spokes, and hub. All the spokes subsist together in the hub. The only way for the spokes to subsist is to be held together at the hub in the center of the wheel. This illustrates Christ’s relationship to creation with respect to the fact that all things subsist in Himself. </p>

Nothing should be regarded as separate from Him. All things were made in the intrinsic power of Christ’s Person, through Him as the active instrument, and unto Him as the consummate goal. Furthermore, all things subsist, are held together, in Him as the hub. Because all things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ and because all things subsist in <span class="pg" data-page-id="83" id="83">[83]</span> Christ, God can be expressed in creation through Christ who is the image of the invisible God. </p>

<p data-content-id="7cuojx9EnikxgkGvSa0_PvMZPlR3bfE5yo0N_UaqITA8UbezEJgBcuGWFgD9_1aau"> It is important to understand accurately the meaning of stewardship. The Greek word rendered stewardship here, <em>oikonomia</em>, is the same word rendered dispensation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92232" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92233" data-verses="Ephesians 3:9">3:9</span>. The word also appears in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92234" data-verses="Ephesians 3:2">Ephesians 3:2</span>, where Paul speaks of the stewardship of grace which had been given to him. According to ancient usage, <em>oikonomia</em> denoted a stewardship, a dispensation, or an administration. At the time of Paul, many rich families had stewards whose responsibility was to distribute food and other supplies to members of the household. Our Father has a great family, a divine household. Because our Father has such vast riches, there is the need in His household for many stewards to dispense these riches to His children. This dispensing is the stewardship. Hence, a stewardship is a dispensation. </p>
<p data-content-id="_0z4CjgcRAzGySPl6nQ9kckrS8MiOnVLuxfmejJOVBUIS_-qK7UtCn7ND1Qwyrk2f"> The word dispensation here does not denote an age or means by which God deals with people; it refers to God’s dispensing of His riches into His chosen ones. This dispensation is the stewardship with the dispensing ministry of the ministers of God. This ministry of dispensing is also God’s administration. Today God administrates by dispensing Himself into us. This stewardship, this dispensation, this administration, is God’s economy. In the New Testament economy of God there is the desperate need of the stewardship of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="BOCvS1r-7tIB54EhOvqqTqjp2qkqzIJvx43xAqzzl996JaIsWLw395nl-aNWe_mB3"> We have pointed out that stewardship refers to the dispensation of wealth in a royal or upper-class family. God’s royal <span class="pg" data-page-id="90" id="90">[90]</span> family is rich in Christ. According to the Epistle to the Colossians, God’s family is especially rich in Christ as the all-inclusive and preeminent One, as the One who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, and the firstborn from among the dead. The riches of such a Christ, who is the full expression of the Triune God, need to be dispensed into the members of God’s family. This service of dispensing, which in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92235" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">1:25</span> is called the stewardship of God, was the work of the Apostle Paul. It also should be our work today. </p>
<p data-content-id="xhOwCJPMz8poSokM7QjIveWcWUVv2HdC3D97biFQx_aZezgsPp4uXJaG_Tl_jpc6R"> Not many ministers or workers in today’s Christianity carry out the stewardship of God. This means that not many are actually dispensing the riches of Christ into the members of God’s royal family. The stewardship of God is needed for this rich, all-inclusive, preeminent Christ to be dispensed into the members of His Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="MbvcrlXtA4GGPOZNOvDot4_k6L0O4_YWsRhB1iUfY2NjrQ3EE-RVlAKh7NIKw-9kI"> This stewardship is the ministry in the New Testament. The New Testament ministry is the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of the all-inclusive Christ into the members of God’s family. The Apostle Paul dispensed the riches of Christ into the saints. This is what we are doing in the ministry today. </p>
<p data-content-id="Vehc_DxwcgXUMWVvg6ZqRxQAc9mkSIcmilbKcMYbZp13kc_c_BsTJjIrnVSGak81f"> The stewardship of God is according to the economy of God. With God it is a matter of economy; with us it is a matter of stewardship. All the saints, no matter how insignificant they may seem to be, have a ministry according to God’s economy. This means that every saint can dispense the riches of Christ into others. </p>
<p data-content-id="iiCXRFpuXcPrT8Ib2ei9Wmk1GkZyhf2ws6tpqdIZHirz4qBni4rQoR_fScofdndKl"> The desire of God’s heart is to dispense Himself into man. This is the central point of the whole Bible. God’s economy is to carry out the dispensing of Himself into man. We share in this economy through our stewardship, our ministry of dispensing the riches of Christ. After the riches of Christ have been dispensed into us, we need to take up the burden to dispense them into others. With God these riches are His economy; with us they are the stewardship; and when they are dispensed by us into others, they become God’s dispensation. When God’s economy reaches us, it becomes our stewardship. When we carry out our stewardship by dispensing Christ into others, it <span class="pg" data-page-id="91" id="91">[91]</span> becomes the dispensation of God into them. Hence, we have the economy, the stewardship, and the dispensation. </p>
<p data-content-id="1aJmujdY8zf3BLa1Nx2x7qmP18CUNhu3l_vTi90iiOmndjKLwrW8aLxpNk6UPXsej"> Those who bear responsibility in the local churches need to share in the stewardship of God. This means that the elders should be those who take the lead to dispense the riches of Christ into others. Although Christ is all-inclusive and preeminent, there is still the need for Him to be dispensed into the members of God’s family. This dispensation takes place through the stewardship. Hence, between the unsearchably rich Christ and the members of His Body, there is the need of the stewardship. All those who take the lead in the Lord’s recovery and have responsibility for the care of the churches need to realize that they have a part in such a divine stewardship. We are not here to carry on an ordinary Christian work. For instance, we are not concerned merely with teaching the Bible in an outward way. Rather, we desire to serve the riches of Christ to all the members of God’s family. In our conversation with one another, we need to minister the riches of Christ. Even when we are invited to the homes of the saints for dinner, we need to dispense the riches of Christ. This is the stewardship of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="9CMGouSfiMWAlo_AF78CKdna93X81reYi6ay6JvhbqmWxQR8qwvMZ9jTvWt74Euid"> Every member of the Body of Christ has a part in this stewardship. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92236" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span> Paul refers to himself as “less than the least of all saints.” This indicates that Paul was even smaller than we are. If Paul could be a steward, then we also can be stewards and dispense the riches of Christ into others. In preaching the gospel, for example, we should not be concerned merely with winning souls. Rather, we should preach the gospel to carry out the stewardship of dispensing the riches of Christ into others. Day by day we need to fulfill our stewardship by dispensing the Triune God into man. Praise the Lord that we all have a share in this stewardship! We all have the privilege of dispensing the unsearchable riches of Christ into others. Therefore, we should not merely preach the gospel or teach the Bible; we should also impart the riches of Christ to others. </p>
<p data-content-id="jSqu1fKMETv3AEO0jRP6XSxNHaR2bzZ3Bj8ZR-J9t-t3Qs846TNRWzfLsChMbFjod"> We have many opportunities to minister the riches of Christ to the saints. Suppose we are helping a family to <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> move. We should not simply move the furniture, but we should supply the riches of Christ to the members of the family, especially to the sister. If we help in the moving without dispensing the riches of Christ, we may actually make things difficult for others. Our intention in helping a family move their belongings should be to dispense the riches of Christ. All our activity with respect to such a service should be with Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Twq0tWAMk6bVuZEt9Z9lD5HOGR4TRsodL3jAfCQiy5hBnTJuAz_YAL8NdDTj2RtGV"> Another opportunity to minister the riches of Christ to others is in giving or receiving hospitality. Both the hosts and the guests should minister the riches of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="nAAjrYoSxORsKcXED0Y92nk_nOW8eDLYu242cBU-V2b50Voz0s71JJrl7esVgPqMx"> May the Lord open our eyes to see that we all have part in the stewardship of God. In every aspect of the practical church life, even in such things as ushering and cleaning the meeting hall, we need to dispense Christ into others. Firstly, we need to be filled with Christ and then minister the riches of Christ to others. This is our stewardship. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6lc_KG4lpSEXBWvOfF9n73K2GSdBhfKSbKVHRXhoCGalmrzef-H9gsKXflDUdQgSY">I. THE STEWARD’S SUFFERINGS</h2><p data-content-id="RfNO2lIzA5Rw54npqQTHNA_TLi86etAgvd8yXLZ0NJhLX6FOEZQflozxR78uf33Oy"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92237" data-verses="Colossians 1:24">1:24</span> Paul says, “Now I rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church.” The afflictions of Christ are of two categories: those for accomplishing redemption, which have been completed by Christ Himself; and those for producing and building the church, which need to be filled up by the apostles and the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="sQ-jiCKNjXFon2Sit_5DdVXU5dyLR6KUaRJLlAaDAC4Gkuj3zqfMcEH9tudAOZTWi"> The fact that Paul mentions the afflictions of Christ in connection with the stewardship of God indicates that the stewardship can be carried out only through suffering. If we desire to share in the stewardship of God, we must be prepared to suffer. All those who participate in the service of the church or in the ministry must be ready to partake of the afflictions of a steward. This means that we must be willing to pay whatever price is necessary to fulfill our stewardship. </p>

I wondered how there could be any lack in the sufferings of Christ. At the time, I was fully under the religious concept that it was impossible for Christ to have any lack. Nevertheless, in this verse Paul says clearly that he was to “fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="4IBzwnFeZUmiPTldQylpqjfn-6Uu2bBeAumWT0F5vBeYLZvZUxnAH8UtbPcg2OgXO">TWO KINDS OF SUFFERING</h2><p data-content-id="omf13Bx02SFTK6-4sHpHdKgU0a2jksigyrvnjZRmemRqzlC_dbZvNK2s_tofFhghm"> Are not the sufferings of Christ already complete? How can it be necessary for the afflictions of Christ on behalf of the Body to be completed? The Lord Jesus underwent two kinds of suffering: the suffering for redemption and the suffering for producing and building up the Body, the church. None of us can have any share in His suffering for redemption. To say that we can participate in this suffering is to speak blasphemy. He alone is the Redeemer, and the suffering for redemption was fully accomplished by Him. We are neither qualified nor positioned to share in the Lord’s suffering for redemption. In typology, on the day of atonement, only the high priest, who made atonement for the people, was allowed to enter into the Holy of Holies. The high priest was a figure of Christ as the unique One capable of accomplishing redemption and qualified to do it. <span class="pg" data-page-id="98" id="98">[98]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="3UjYSiEHFuVk3dorn6OJHP8S0_9jMsTE1JDXU4fE-zxmVMphWG74zhUcdZ0bQV1Uw"> A number of verses speak of Christ’s sufferings for the accomplishment of redemption. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92258" data-verses="1Peter 3:18">1 Peter 3:18</span> says, “For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.” Christ, the righteous One, died for the unrighteous ones. He was the only One qualified to bear this kind of affliction. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92259" data-verses="Hebrews 9:26">Hebrews 9:26</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92260" data-verses="Isaiah 53:3-5">Isaiah 53:3-5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92261" data-verses="Isaiah 53:7-8">7-8</span> also indicate that Christ suffered to accomplish redemption on our behalf. In this suffering we have no share. It was borne by Christ alone. </p>
<p data-content-id="GpAIfwI6Fm0o_bJAzhxAk04CQq9shXPbvl-wOzBXDm09fW-1mBX4cRfsZbOTdf_Bp"> Although we cannot participate in Christ’s suffering for redemption, if we are faithful to Him, we must share in His suffering for the producing and building up of His Body. Paul was a pattern for us in this matter. Immediately after his conversion, he began to share in this suffering of Christ, to partake of the afflictions of Christ for the sake of His Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="8W3SYV3ote4j4Rg0nTLNGDsadWLYGnmEc9qelKbjNksm4WKd2cErScxTa7rBwQTLq"> This is contrary to the concept that nothing related to Christ can be lacking. According to this concept, whatever Christ is and does is complete. But here is a word telling us that at least one thing related to Christ is lacking—His afflictions for producing and building up His Body. For the producing of His Body, Christ suffered a great deal. But because this suffering has not been completed by Christ Himself, there is the need for His faithful ones to make up this shortage. Paul did not suffer for redemption, but he did suffer for the producing and building up of the Body of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="0dvJwNTlnFFL7ZQjBM_mXPhF8jLx0TI_QdjxYstvjmR9qWy9nTfOsrOtXWOoopoj0"> The Apostle Paul was a pattern for the believers to follow (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92262" data-verses="1Timothy 1:16">1 Tim. 1:16</span>). We must consider Paul as a pattern, not as someone who was so high that no one else can be like he was. Because by the Lord’s mercy Paul was set up to be a pattern for us, whatever he was, we can be also. We must believe in the Lord’s mercy. If the mercy of the Lord made Paul a pattern, then His mercy can accomplish in us the same thing that it did in Paul. This means that just as Paul suffered for the producing and building up of the Body of Christ, so we must also suffer for the church. <span class="pg" data-page-id="99" id="99">[99]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="7cuojx9EnikxgkGvSa0_PvMZPlh3cNE5yo0N_UaqITA8UbezEJgBcuGWFgD9_1aau"> Christ, of course, took the lead to suffer for the producing and building up of His Body. But the apostles and believers must follow Christ’s footsteps in suffering this kind of affliction. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92263" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span> the Lord Jesus said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.” This verse does not speak of Christ’s redeeming death, but of His producing, generating death. Christ fell into the ground and died as a grain of wheat in order to produce many grains for the church. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92264" data-verses="John 12:26">John 12:26</span>, those who desire to serve Him must follow Him in this regard. </p>
<p data-content-id="_0z4CjgcRAzGySPl6nQ9kckrS88iI1FLuxfmejJOVBUIS_-qK7UtCn7ND1Qwyrk2f"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92265" data-verses="Luke 12:50">Luke 12:50</span> the Lord Jesus said, “But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!” The word baptism in this verse refers to Christ’s all-inclusive death on the cross, a death that was not only for redemption, but also for producing the Body through the release of the divine life. As the Lord’s word to His disciples in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92266" data-verses="Mark 10:38-39">Mark 10:38 and 39</span> makes clear, they also were to share in the baptism with which He Himself was to be baptized. </p>
<p data-content-id="BOCvS1r-7tIB54EhOvqqTqjp2qUq6bpvx43xAqzzl996JaIsWLw395nl-aNWe_mB3"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92267" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Philippians 3:10</span> Paul speaks of knowing the fellowship of Christ’s sufferings. These sufferings are not for redemption, but for the building up of the Body. We cannot have fellowship in Christ’s sufferings for redemption, but we need to have much fellowship in Christ’s sufferings for the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xhOwCJPMz8poSokM7QjIveWcWUlv-UtC3D97biFQx_aZezgsPp4uXJaG_Tl_jpc6R">A JOINT PARTAKER OF TRIBULATION IN JESUS</h2><p data-content-id="riqDpjchUDoSOoMli_WZl-Ii1q8FEPNu7gQhs2g1WdrF9hCb4rF0iMESoWGxdqC3t"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92268" data-verses="Revelation 1:9">Revelation 1:9</span> John says that he was a “joint partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus.” To say that we are joint partakers in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus indicates that we are suffering. When Jesus lived on earth as a man, He suffered continually. According to the history of His life, His name Jesus denotes a suffering person, a man of sorrows (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92269" data-verses="Isaiah 53:3">Isa. 53:3</span>). Therefore, to be a joint partaker of tribulation in Jesus is to suffer and to be persecuted as we follow Jesus the Nazarene. The book of Revelation is for those who are suffering tribulation in Jesus. As we wait for the coming of the Lord, we must be <span class="pg" data-page-id="100" id="100">[100]</span> willing to suffer. This suffering is for the Body, the church. We must participate in the sufferings of Jesus for the sake of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="d9yHx1EHlCF0Nc2ISA4iR70qFZEB08jQsAr0x-_n5uKwoGhkDJWrhSt-NWfOCM6YO"> When Jesus was on earth, He was persecuted by the Jewish religion, a religion formed according to God’s oracles. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92270" data-verses="John 5:16">John 5:16</span> says that the Jews persecuted Jesus because He broke their Sabbath. Religious people cannot tolerate the breaking of their regulations. Any violation of their religious regulations will stir up persecution. When Jesus broke the Sabbath, the Jewish religionists persecuted Him and even sought to kill Him. Eventually, religion succeeded in sentencing Jesus to death. </p>
<p data-content-id="QoYPkMNcmTS0w0HcQG2WFMBh5iJNjcno00ymhHKS1B0KuZrfvJx-ndqeKB8A9ADgi"> Just as religion persecuted Jesus, it also persecutes the followers of Jesus. We know from the book of Acts that the Jews in the synagogues stood up in opposition to the apostles. Paul suffered this kind of persecution very much. John, the writer of Revelation, also experienced it. John was exiled to the island of Patmos “for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.” He became a joint partaker in the suffering, the affliction, in Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="KavjviC-d0XiSiopL73LYAPbtweJc9ycsRXMlBkeWvyXWct-X5tTcxic3H8-f0epm"> The persecution against the Lord Jesus originated not with the secular world, but with the religious world. In the book of Acts we see that the situation was the same regarding the persecution of the apostles. The opposition did not come mainly from the Gentiles, but from the Jewish religion. In like manner, a great many martyrs have suffered persecution at the hand of religion. Religion always persecutes the genuine followers of Jesus. Now it is our turn to undergo this persecution, this suffering for the building up of the Body of Christ. During the years I was with Brother Nee in China, I saw how much he was persecuted by religion. The rumors, opposition, and condemnation came from the religious people. In his subtlety, Satan, the Devil, uses religion to oppose and to persecute those who follow the Lord Jesus. Therefore, like John on the island of Patmos, we also must be joint partakers in the tribulation in Jesus. In this way we make up what is lacking of the afflictions of Christ for the church. <span class="pg" data-page-id="101" id="101">[101]</span> </p>

THE WORD OF GOD INCLUDING<br/>THE OLD TESTAMENT AND THE WORD<br/>PREACHED BY THE EARLY DISCIPLES</h2><p data-content-id="5znjdl0RibbATJcKH_ecb09_jdxFpWQnNfuxNd8ItWQaf-xO-QYNQQKXpfnLolJRo"> At the time of Paul, the word of God included the Old Testament and the word preached by the early disciples. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92284" data-verses="Acts 4:29">Acts 4:29</span> the disciples prayed that they might preach God’s word with boldness. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92285" data-verses="Acts 4:31">Acts 4:31</span>, “they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92286" data-verses="Acts 6:4">Acts 6:4</span> we see that the apostles gave themselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92287" data-verses="Acts 6:7">Acts 6:7</span> tells us that “the word of God increased.” Those who were scattered because of the persecution against the church following the death of Stephen “went every where preaching the word” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92288" data-verses="Acts 8:4">Acts 8:4</span>). Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92289" data-verses="Acts 12:24">Acts 12:24</span> says that “the word of God grew and multiplied.” </p>
<p data-content-id="NvL9nhfr9y1MfkuCnJjWc5-mCmAZYbn-02hvDSNt9dQdENu8DeMorULDAd59B1LCF"> Although the word of God preached by the early disciples grew and multiplied, it was not yet completed according to God’s economy. For this completion, God’s revelation to Paul was needed. Because the Jews have only the Old Testament, they do not have the complete oracle of God. Moreover, although Christians have both the Old Testament and the New Testament, in actuality many of them do not have <span class="pg" data-page-id="106" id="106">[106]</span> the complete revelation of God. In their experience and in their understanding, they may have only the Gospels, Acts, and part of Romans. Many have studied the Bible, but still lack an adequate understanding of the divine revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="t5iqp8-G4gD5mGLTCIR_DHqa7Ssdy_VuKEbpWrQpW1yZ_muRMBVOIaTGcMROMFrnI"> According to the stewardship of God, Paul became a minister of the church to complete the word of God. Consider what a lack there would be if we did not have the Epistles of Paul. Without them, there would be no completion of the word of God. Paul’s stewardship was to complete the word of God in order to dispense Christ with all His riches into the churches. The revelation given to Paul was for the completion of God’s word. Therefore, it is crucial that we all know the revelation that was given to Paul. </p>

<p data-content-id="sQ-jiCKNjXFon2Sit_5DdVXU5dSLS6qUaRJLlAaDAC4Gkuj3zqfMcEH9tudAOZTWi"> Paul received the revelation of Christ as the mystery of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92290" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">2:2</span> he speaks of the “full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.” This term, the mystery of God, is not found in the Old Testament. The Gospels do not record any time that it was used by the Lord Jesus. It was first used by Paul in his Epistles. The mystery of God is Christ as the embodiment of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92291" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Colossians 2:9</span> says, “For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.” </p>
<p data-content-id="wrbcmMjVyCQkgWdRivfLA0DYst0ML4ud3uqzGEffBGQc6UVl06Y-KY2UHVu1-W7x4"> As the mystery of God, Christ must be both the embodiment of God and the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92292" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92293" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>). All fundamental Christian teachers believe that Christ is the embodiment of God, but very few see that He is also the life-giving Spirit. In order for us to know Christ in reality as the embodiment of God, we need to experience Him as the life-giving Spirit. Because the enemy knows the crucial significance of this, he attacks this point intensely. If we do not realize that Christ is the life-giving Spirit, the fact that Christ is the embodiment of God is merely doctrine or theory. It is just an objective teaching not at all related to our Christian experience. If this is the situation, there is <span class="pg" data-page-id="107" id="107">[107]</span> no way for theory to become reality. The reality of Christ as the embodiment of God is in Christ as the life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="LGGjP-PAOdJ8nFxUYQbpLuUq2AsMQvyhMQZw72ekAlg3c478l-zKR4IjWE4Bf53rA"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92294" data-verses="John 14:16-18">John 14:16 through 18</span> the Lord Jesus said, “And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality, Whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you. I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.” The One who is the Spirit of reality in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92295" data-verses="John 14:17">verse 17</span> becomes the very One who is the Lord Himself in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92296" data-verses="John 14:18">verse 18</span>; He becomes I. This indicates that after His resurrection the Lord became the Spirit of reality. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92297" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">First Corinthians 15:45</span>, which deals with the matter of resurrection, confirms this by saying that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. Paul was bold and not at all ambiguous in declaring the fact that Christ is the Spirit. To the natural mind it is not logical that the last Adam, a man in the flesh, could become a life-giving Spirit. Nevertheless, Paul uncompromisingly declared this fact. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92298" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Corinthians 3:17</span> he said, “Now the Lord is that Spirit.” According to the context of the whole chapter, the Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92299" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">verse 17</span> is the Spirit who gives life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92300" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:6">verse 6</span>. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92301" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">2 Timothy 4:22</span> Paul clearly said, “The Lord be with thy spirit.” How clear is Paul’s word! </p>
<p data-content-id="mLlsVgAIb-skAhfjqngkuMQK1-xuoCw-Eh0Y8vVQpH3WrdTCEmNX27ibG0XFE_F6p"> In 1964 I was warned by an intimate friend not to teach that Christ is the Spirit. This one admitted that the Bible teaches that Christ is the Spirit. However, because religious tradition makes others unwilling to accept this fact, he was not bold to declare it. I told my friend, “If I do not teach that Christ is the life-giving Spirit, I have no ministry. I came to this country with the burden mainly to minister along this line.” Later that year I gave a series of messages on Christ as the Spirit. These messages are printed in <em>The Economy of God.</em> </p>
<p data-content-id="ZIaYAIUhlPYkrS-W4qNUAjewUd--Me35Enf7GKa9aNGLCeSPPJyL_qRbhaKXPVpri"> Many of us can testify of the help we have received in life through realizing that our Lord today is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit. If Christ were not the Spirit in our spirit, how could we experience Him as our life? We would have no experience of Christ as life. Instead, we would simply have another <span class="pg" data-page-id="108" id="108">[108]</span> form of religious practice. But because we have Christ as the life-giving Spirit, we do not have a religion. We have the living Christ in our experience. On the one hand, He is the embodiment of the fullness of God and, on the other hand, He is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit. This revelation of Christ is part of the revelation given to Paul for the completion of the word of God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="A9Ho75-1IEWiI5pZAWtoolFIDEqNq-gDjip1OYh6Z3Q5wGMSc15rgkFYdiHX9QQ7d">B. The Dispensation of God</h2><p data-content-id="F8T5SrvVvSK9adYDT1faMIT2vI0YTeOvvK68nXJGmPygBYfXAuqVH6_7nXxzbpNoL"> Paul was also given the revelation concerning the dispensation of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92302" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Cor. 13:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92303" data-verses="Ephesians 3:14-19">Eph. 3:14-19</span>). The word dispensation has been damaged through misuse. To many Christians it refers simply to the ways in which God deals with people, ways that are called dispensations. When we use the word dispensation, however, we use it with the meaning of dispensing. In His economy, God is dispensing Himself into us. Paul was the first to speak of God’s dispensation, and his writings reveal that God is now dispensing Himself into our being. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92304" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Corinthians 13:14</span> says, “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all” (Gk.). This is the dispensing of the Triune God into our being. Where else in the Bible can you find such a clear word concerning the dispensation of the Triune God into the believers? In this verse we have the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow. What a dispensation! </p>
<p data-content-id="CV0IHBXEspCOWkPgBxpK-FPjtRq4Ks12YOitnjJYe71lPdJfo-RTTzkzgsHXnVKBu"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92305" data-verses="Ephesians 3:14-19">Ephesians 3:14-19</span> Paul also speaks of God’s dispensation. He prays to the Father that we may be strengthened with power by His Spirit into our inner man so that Christ may make His home in our hearts. The result is that we are rooted and grounded in love and are strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth, length, height, and depth, and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God. In these verses Paul speaks of the Triune God—the Father, the Spirit, and Christ (the Son). Through the dispensation of the Triune God into our being, we become the fullness of God, His expression. <span class="pg" data-page-id="109" id="109">[109]</span> </p>

The Greek word rendered stewardship, <em>oikonomia,</em> may also be rendered economy or administration. The stewardship is the economy, and God’s economy is His dispensation. God’s intention in His economy is to dispense Himself—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—into His chosen people. </p>
<p data-content-id="jSqu1fKMETv3AEO0jRP6XSxNHbB2dgp3Bj8ZR-J9t-t3Qs846TNRWzfLsChMbFjod"> Christ is the mystery, the secret, and the crucial focus, of the divine economy. This means that the secret of the dispensation of the Triune God into God’s chosen people is Christ Himself. Christ is the focal point of God’s dispensation. God’s dispensation is altogether related to Christ and focused on Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Twq0tWAMk6bVuZEt9Z9lD5HOGQoTY_odL3jAfCQiy5hBnTJuAz_YAL8NdDTj2RtGV"> For centuries, Christians have been reading the Epistles of Paul, but very few have seen the matter of God’s economy and Christ as the mystery of this economy. I can testify that I read Ephesians and Colossians for years before I began to see that Christ is the mystery of God’s economy. Early in my Christian life, I did not see that Christ is the secret of God’s dispensation. This matter is hidden and is not according to our natural concept. In order to see it we need to pray and to exercise our spirit as we study the Epistle of Colossians in a detailed way. Let us now consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92321" data-verses="Colossians 1:25-29">1:25-29</span> in some detail. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nAAjrYoSxORsKcXED0Y92nk_nPG8WQbYu242cBU-V2b50Voz0s71JJrl7esVgPqMx">A MINISTER OF THE CHURCH</h2><p data-content-id="QoYPkMNcmTS0w0HcQG2WFMBh5jpNjeno00ymhHKS1B0KuZrfvJx-ndqeKB8A9ADgi"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92322" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">Verse 25</span> says, “Of which I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God.” The word “which” refers to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="114" id="114">[114]</span> church in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92323" data-verses="Colossians 1:24">verse 24</span>. This indicates that Paul became a minister, not of a certain mission work or of a particular work of teaching and preaching, but of the church. The word minister describes one who serves. Paul became such a minister of the church according to the stewardship, the economy, the dispensation, of God. This stewardship was given to Paul for the church. The goal of God’s stewardship for the church was to complete the word of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KavjviC-d0XiSiopL73LYAPbtx-Jc_ycsRXMlBkeWvyXWct-X5tTcxic3H8-f0epm">THE MYSTERY MANIFESTED TO THE SAINTS</h2><p data-content-id="lGebDchapj8MhaQa-6qJi3EWmzf6DCoIEBHfdfUryVbKKL4PAwixxjPTbBKYDu4Le"> Notice that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92324" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">verse 25</span> does not end with a period, but with a comma. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92325" data-verses="Colossians 1:26">verse 26</span> Paul continues, “The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations, but now has been manifested to His saints.” According to grammar, the mystery in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92326" data-verses="Colossians 1:26">verse 26</span> is in apposition to the word of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92327" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">verse 25</span>. This means that the word of God is the very mystery which has been hidden from the ages and generations, but is now made manifest to the saints. The ages here denote eternity, whereas the generations denote the times. The mystery concerning Christ and the church had been hidden from eternity and from all times until the New Testament age, when it was manifested to the saints, the believers in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="OLv1qDRjKPpb7WeQhnpjddP7nSLMWtpE-1ppPPLq1fp8MR8MpzzfwWWMlwmSEija5"> It is important that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92328" data-verses="Colossians 1:26">verse 26</span> Paul does not say that the mystery has been manifested to the apostles; he says that it has been manifested to the saints. Due to the influence of religious tradition, many believe that such things as God’s economy cannot be understood by the so-called laymen. How we thank the Lord that the mystery has been manifested to the saints, to all those who believe in Christ! Even the youngest ones among us have both the position to see this mystery and the privilege of seeing it. We have the privilege of seeing something that was not revealed to Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, or to the prophets such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Zechariah. Praise the Lord that we can know the completion of the word of God! We can know Christ as the mystery of God’s economy and the Body as Christ’s fullness. Furthermore, we can know that the church is the new man with Christ as the <span class="pg" data-page-id="115" id="115">[115]</span> content and constituent. None of these things was made known to God’s people in the Old Testament age. </p>
<p data-content-id="4IBzwnFeZUmiPTldQylpqjfn-70uxIheAumWT0F5vBeYLZvZUxnAH8UtbPcg2OgXO"> Today we focus our attention upon Christ as the mystery of God and upon the church as the mystery of Christ. As the mystery of God, the all-inclusive Christ is the embodiment of God and also the life-giving Spirit. As the mystery of Christ, the church is the Body of Christ, His fullness, and the new man to be the full expression of Christ as well. This is the mystery that has been made manifest to the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="omf13Bx02SFTK6-4sHpHdKgU0bWji_SgyrvnjZRmemRqzlC_dbZvNK2s_tofFhghm"> Paul’s writing in this Epistle is quite complex. He uses many long sentences with various clauses and relative pronouns. Actually, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92329" data-verses="Colossians 1:24-29">verses 24 through 29</span> should be regarded as a single sentence. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92330" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">verse 27</span>, the continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92331" data-verses="Colossians 1:26">verse 26</span>, Paul says, “To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.” The word “whom” at the beginning of this verse refers to the saints mentioned in the preceding verse. To us God has willed to make known the riches of the glory of this mystery. This mystery, which is Christ in us as the hope of glory, is made known among the nations. The word “which” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92332" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">verse 27</span> refers to the mystery. This mystery full of glory among the nations is Christ in us. Christ in us is mysterious and glorious as well. Because Paul was dealing with matters deep and profound, his writing was complex, and his sentences were long. </p>

The riches of this mystery among the nations are the riches of all that Christ is to the Gentile believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92334" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Eph. 3:8</span>). At the time Paul wrote to the Colossians, the Jews regarded the Gentiles, the nations, as swine. Nevertheless, Paul says that God has willed to make known the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, that is, among the Gentile “swine.” Various terms could be used to describe the Gentiles: sinners, rebels, enemies of God, sons of disobedience, sons of wrath. Before we were saved, we were in this category. But even among such people <span class="pg" data-page-id="116" id="116">[116]</span> God has willed to make known the riches of the glory of this mystery. </p>
<p data-content-id="c33eAwsfVfXraWL3f3puOBKwvfKxS9tqYFcEXib3Lo6hB_NVq0ahbWwl2qspOIzbJ"> After you were saved, did you not have the sense that you had entered into glory? Many of us had this kind of experience. Although we were sinners, enemies, and rebels, we have become sons of God. We are also heirs of God, joint partakers of Christ, and even the members of Christ. Furthermore, the New Testament reveals that we are priests and kings. As heirs of God, we shall inherit not only God Himself, but all things. We are sons of God, heirs of God, partners of Christ, and priests and kings. What a glory this is! </p>
<p data-content-id="YHo9_4F4rbtTN6uJrNVKlcVHdapwaukIM1JeaWPCErK8lD8OYCz-gEq8DCxiWamqp"> If we see this glory, we shall also know the riches of the glory, even though we lack the language to utter these riches adequately. These riches include the divine life, the divine nature, the anointing, and the all-inclusive Spirit. Other aspects of the riches are righteousness, justification, holiness, sanctification, transformation, glorification, comfort, and the divine Presence. It is impossible to list all the riches. They are beyond counting. These are the riches of the unique glory, the glory that is ours because we are sons and heirs of God, partners of Christ, and priests and kings. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ekj8KtyS_lkUZoS96keszutDj3I6B2wcNJn28_oNc3vFOaI1hUNqhE5B4RkV_HSQJ"> The key to the riches of glory is Christ Himself. Although the Jews in ancient times were the people of God and not Gentile “swine,” they did not recognize the Lord Jesus as their Messiah. To many Jews today, the term Messiah has no reality. When their Messiah comes and they recognize Him, He will only be among them. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92335" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">1:27</span> indicates that Christ is not merely among us; He is in us. To us Christ is not only the objective One, but also the subjective One dwelling in us. We need to tell the Jews that instead of waiting for their Messiah to come only in an outward way, they too can have Christ, the true Messiah, dwelling in them right now and thereby become sons of God. The Jews who receive Christ into them will not only be the people of God chosen by Him, but also the sons of God regenerated by Him. What a glory it is to be indwelt by Christ! </p>

In this message we shall go on to see that Christ in us is the hope of glory. In order to be impressed with this aspect of Christ, we need to pay attention to a number of crucial points regarding Christ that are covered in Colossians. </p>

CHRIST, THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS</h2><p data-content-id="A9Ho75-1IEWiI5pZAWtoolFIDFKNstwDjip1OYh6Z3Q5wGMSc15rgkFYdiHX9QQ7d"> Christ is the portion of the saints. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92367" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">Colossians 1:12</span> says, “Giving thanks to the Father, who qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.” This is the first aspect of Christ presented in this Epistle. The word portion denotes Christ as the lot of the saints in the good land, flowing with milk and honey. The very Christ who indwells us is such a good land. He is the all-inclusive Christ for our enjoyment. </p>

CHRIST, THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="CV0IHBXEspCOWkPgBxpK-FPjtQK4C8F2YOitnjJYe71lPdJfo-RTTzkzgsHXnVKBu"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92368" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">1:15</span>, Christ is also the image of the invisible God. This means that Christ is the expression of God. Although God is invisible, He is expressed in Christ. The very Christ who is our good land is also the image of the Triune God, His expression. As God’s expression, Christ is the image of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="122" id="122">[122]</span> </p>

Thus, Christ is the means by which God expresses Himself. The fact that the image of God and the firstborn of creation are mentioned in the same verse indicates that the image of God is related to creation. This indicates clearly that as the firstborn of God’s creation, Christ is the image of God, His expression. </p>

Unbelievers know only of the first creation, the creation of the universe. However, according to the Bible, God also has a new creation, which is the church. Christ is the firstborn not only of the old creation, but also of the new creation. As the firstborn of both creations, Christ is God’s expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="piRKMgn5tqXQZ3-2TvISTCkGJuQ07Q5jTePG4ht9Tcd7P32I3OUf8n-_v44p36SzH"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92371" data-verses="Colossians 1:15-20">Verses 15 through 20</span> are closely connected and express one complete thought. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92372" data-verses="Colossians 1:15-16">verses 15 and 16</span> we see that Christ is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, because all things were created in Him. Notice that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92373" data-verses="Colossians 1:17-18">verses 17 and 18</span> each begin with the conjunction “and.” Finally, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92374" data-verses="Colossians 1:19">verse 19</span>, Paul presents the conclusion of this line of thought: “For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell.” </p>
<p data-content-id="vIx9uQjmeEwOiVEgDgH8y0xEaeg03MyCYgINrThFa0OoCG1Z0wmuhOJ40BCNUJHpK"> Paul’s use of the word all in the phrase “all the fullness” indicates that the fullness both in the old creation and in the new creation dwells in Christ. We have pointed out that fullness is equal to image and also to expression. According to New Testament usage, the fullness also denotes the Body. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92375" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span> Paul says that the church is Christ’s Body, “the fullness of the One who fills all in all.” The Body is the fullness, the fullness is the expression, and the expression is <span class="pg" data-page-id="123" id="123">[123]</span> the image. If we would understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92376" data-verses="Colossians 1:15-20">Colossians 1:15-20</span>, we must see that the image in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92377" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">verse 15</span> denotes the very fullness as the expression in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92378" data-verses="Colossians 1:19">verse 19</span>. Hence, the image of God is the expression of God, and this expression is the fullness of God. The fullness of God is seen in the old creation because Christ is the firstborn of creation and also in the new creation because Christ is the firstborn from among the dead. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92379" data-verses="Colossians 1:19">verse 19</span> speaks of all the fullness. All the fullness was pleased to dwell in the all-inclusive Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="W0UKyOT0t1IBxSIccUYMsUMOkQbZ3c_JmT-k52DOjH1qiyrn6ODlKeTuGk-ooeEF4"> If we have the proper spiritual perspective, we shall see Christ when we look at the universe. Likewise, when we consider the church, we shall also see Christ. Both in the universe and in the church there is the fullness of God, His expression. This expression is the very Christ who is the image of the invisible God. </p>
<p data-content-id="2KhgJ0DuKwQnI2lO6O2N5dgXvfrpagtkMP3qeHnY675TwiRdcLBNxgl-yEWidZOr3"> Every thoughtful person realizes that there is some kind of expression in the universe. The more we consider the universe, the more we are conscious that it is the expression of something. According to Colossians, the universe is the expression of the fullness of the invisible God. In the same principle, when we view the proper church life, we are also conscious of a certain expression. This expression is also that of the image of the invisible God. This image is Christ. Because Christ is the firstborn of both the old creation and the new creation, He is the expression of the invisible God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="uei5QW3MGv90tAA2FxD3LJZfbM3-F6R75QFjeBrVrSzVrCFjdoepppbzqxBliOuF8">V.

This thought is echoed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92381" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">2:9</span>, where Paul says, “For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.” The fullness both in the old creation and in the new creation dwells in Christ. This fullness refers not to the riches of God, but to the expression of these riches. The expression of God’s riches dwells in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ij7bPPSnYgJ7k5YLk7p3WF7OFu04-jCspqhi6sQh09yxxcsmTBisNQ0qrwyEIQciJ"> Many Christians speak of the indwelling Christ without realizing that the Christ who indwells them is the all-inclusive One. If some were asked what kind of Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="124" id="124">[124]</span> lives in them, they would speak only of Christ as the Savior and the Redeemer. This, of course, is not wrong, but it is very inadequate. When Paul says, “Christ in you, the hope of glory” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92382" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">1:27</span>), he is referring to a very rich Christ, to the Christ who is our good land, the expression of the invisible God, the firstborn of both the old creation and the new creation, and the One in whom all the fullness is pleased to dwell. Even these items do not exhaust all that Christ is. It is the Christ with all these aspects who dwells in us to be our hope of glory. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="HJXSCv7FjRX11Nlg8l5j7efQn6HgNN56T3GdC5v5dCb9ChbHCNsZDKBUk5DL1WVtx">VI. CHRIST, THE MYSTERY OF GOD’S ECONOMY</h2><p data-content-id="XqFwK4-uCOxRvgyEbG31TFRJeBXgNxVv26KaLLx9rvafbSffqSmEd1W12EaU8vYF3"> Many Christians, even Christian pastors and ministers, do not know what the mystery of God’s economy is. Some are not even familiar with this term. The mystery of God’s economy is Christ. The Christ who indwells us is the mystery of this economy, an economy that involves God’s administration of the whole universe. How profound! God has a universal economy, and the center, the focal point, of this economy is Christ. Furthermore, this economy is abstract, profound, and mysterious. The mystery of this universal economy, its indescribable element, is Christ. The Colossians were very foolish in turning from such a Christ to Gnosticism, mysticism, and asceticism. What need did they have for philosophy when they had the very Christ who is the mystery of God’s universal economy? How vital it is for us to realize that the very Christ who is the mystery of God’s economy dwells in us! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="kX1nUfZuqQkzrLrgt3NFkih8mBhwT3-J9RDPm9pQmA9VJDK3iAAZbqak9qWDfH_Sw">VII. CHRIST, THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="J_nFMNQorB6p2GT8JBzVIJEJgg9RLYtHJ9mfOn7jgTGQpHDcX8vywWDQZdhqUypmp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92383" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">2:2</span> Paul speaks of the “full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.” As the mystery of God, Christ is the embodiment of God and also the life-giving Spirit. Although we find it easy to speak of many things, it is difficult for us to speak of Christ as God’s mystery. Concerning this, our mind is like a block of marble that is not able to absorb liquid. Although we may hear message after message about Christ as the mystery of God, we may not apprehend anything we hear. <span class="pg" data-page-id="125" id="125">[125]</span> Many years ago I met a certain brother who was fond of repeating the phrase, “Christ in me, the hope of glory.” However, this brother had very little knowledge of Christ. Although he liked to talk about the indwelling Christ, he did not truly know Christ in this aspect. He did not realize that the Christ who lived in Him is the very mystery of God. </p>

<p data-content-id="2KhgJ0DuKwQnI2lO6O2N5dgXvfbpez9kMP3qeHnY675TwiRdcLBNxgl-yEWidZOr3"> Speaking of Christ who dwells in us as the hope of glory, Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92416" data-verses="Colossians 1:28">1:28</span>, “Whom we announce, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ.” The Greek word rendered full-grown may also be translated mature, complete, or perfect. Paul’s ministry was to impart Christ to others so that they may be perfect and complete by maturing in Christ unto full growth. However, many Christian workers today do not have any concept of presenting every man full-grown in Christ. The goal of their work is something other than this. But we must have the same goal that Paul had. </p>
<p data-content-id="uei5QW3MGv90tAA2FxD3LJZfbMH-Cqx75QFjeBrVrSzVrCFjdoepppbzqxBliOuF8"> Even in preaching the gospel, our aim should be to impart life in order to present others mature, full-grown, in Christ. As we preach the gospel to unbelievers, minister Christ to them, and help them to receive the Lord, our goal is not merely that they should be saved from the lake of fire and from God’s condemnation. Our goal is not only for them to experience God’s forgiveness; it is to minister Christ into them so that they may eventually be presented full-grown in Christ. If we fail to impart Christ to others as we preach the gospel, our gospel preaching will fall short of God’s standard. Christ must be infused into all those to whom we speak. Imparting Christ should be our aim in our gospel preaching. </p>
<p data-content-id="f5FHReDvsyzvBMFzyvsIslz0TPFlKKagmUB6rb4-E6X-5JRriI2ZE461KcHMoNa9f"> We should have the same goal in our fellowship with the saints. As we contact the saints, our goal should be to minister Christ into them so that they may mature in Him. </p>

The Christ we minister must be the all-inclusive One, the centrality and universality of God’s economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92418" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">1:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92419" data-verses="Colossians 1:18-19">18-19</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92420" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92421" data-verses="Colossians 2:4">2:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92422" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92423" data-verses="Colossians 2:16-17">16-17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92424" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">3:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92425" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">11</span>). If we do not experience Christ in a full way, we shall find it difficult to minister Christ to others. For example, if we do not experience living by Christ, we cannot help anyone else to live by Christ. But if in our daily living we live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ, we shall spontaneously infuse Christ into others as we contact them. The more we take Christ as our life and our person, the more we shall be able to minister Christ to others. Having become those who experience Christ and live by Him, we shall influence others to do the same. We need to enjoy Christ as our good land, labor on Him, live in Him, walk in Him, and have our being in Him. If we are such persons, we shall transfuse into others the very Christ whom we experience and by whom we live. In the Lord’s recovery what we need is not simply more labor to bring others into the church life. We need to minister the riches of Christ into others so that they may grow and mature. For this we ourselves need to experience more of Christ as the portion of the saints. </p>

It is possible to be what everyone would consider a good brother or sister but still be short of the riches of Christ. In my contact with saints as I have traveled, I have met many who lacked the riches of Christ in their daily living, although everyone would consider them very good brothers and sisters. May the Lord awaken within us the aspiration to be rich in Christ. We need to pray, “Lord, I don’t <span class="pg" data-page-id="131" id="131">[131]</span> want to be one who seems to be good but who is poor as far as the riches of Christ are concerned. Lord, for the building up of the church, cause me to be filled with the riches of Christ.” </p>
<p data-content-id="DoDlSswZom_4i2OTnuzO3QHEF5sZ3SZ-vevsKnj9CyhxI_r5snfUvFBDoS7HJ6EHS"> I thank the Lord for those saints whose living is characterized by the riches of Christ. Such brothers and sisters are transparent. Those who are short of the riches of Christ, on the contrary, are opaque, altogether lacking in transparency. But those who have the riches of Christ are crystal clear. Whenever you bring something to them in fellowship, the matter becomes clear to you because they themselves are so transparent. Those who enjoy the riches of Christ become clear as crystal. The more we experience the riches of Christ, the more transparent we shall become. May we all desire to be those who are rich in Christ and fully transparent! May we pray, “Lord, make me a member of the Body who is rich in Your life and who is transparent. Save me from being a member who is good but who is short of Christ.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Sr4B7OdLi_gaxbmxLXiEYa2SR2KIHqPLZGWdu23POQDxs7Xqf3z_YUMIa59gSQKwD"> Only those who are rich in Christ can build up the Body for the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose. We must admit that we still do not have very much building among us. We may be more concerned about our individual spirituality and growth than about the building up of the church. If we are short of Christ and lacking in transparency, we shall have little concern for the building up of the church. But if we are filled with the riches of Christ and thereby become transparent, we shall be deeply concerned for the building up of the church so that God’s purpose may be fulfilled. </p>

To present others mature in Christ we must help them to have the completion of the word of God concerning Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ. However, if we consider our situation, we shall realize that not many of us are able to complete the word in <span class="pg" data-page-id="132" id="132">[132]</span> this way. For this reason I am burdened that we would be stirred up to pursue the Lord. We need to hunger and thirst after Him, to pursue Him until we are filled with His riches. We need to pray, “Lord Jesus, we don’t want to be indifferent or lukewarm. We long to be absolute with You and to seek You to the uttermost.” If we pursue the Lord in such a way, we shall see more regarding Christ and the church. But if we continue to be short of the riches of Christ, we shall not have in our own experience the completion of the word of God. Hence, there is the desperate need for us to pray and to labor on Christ for the completing of the word of God concerning Christ and the church. </p>

BY MINISTERING CHRIST AS<br/>THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="NvL9nhfr9y1MfkuCnJjWc5-mCnQZRLH-02hvDSNt9dQdENu8DeMorULDAd59B1LCF"> Fourthly, we need to minister Christ as the mystery of God, that is, as the embodiment of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92428" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">2:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92429" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">9</span>). We need to share with others from our experience how Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. We need to be able to testify how we daily experience Christ as the Father, Son, and Spirit. Because we have Christ, we also have the Father. Because we are in Christ, we are also in the Spirit. The Spirit who moves within us actually is Christ Himself. Day by day we should be one spirit with the Lord and experience His being one with us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92430" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). More and more our experience must be that in every aspect of our daily living, wherever we may be, we are one spirit with the Lord. This should not be a doctrine or theory; it must be our practical Christian living. </p>
<p data-content-id="t5iqp8-G4gD5mGLTCIR_DHqa7T8d6vluKEbpWrQpW1yZ_muRMBVOIaTGcMROMFrnI"> Concerning my ministry, I often pray like this: “Lord, give me the grace to be one spirit with You as I speak. Lord, I pray that You will speak in my speaking. I believe, Lord, that You are one Spirit with me. But I ask that as I minister the Word, I shall be one spirit with You.” Whatever impact this ministry has comes from such a oneness with the Lord. </p>

We have pointed out that Paul labored to present every man full-grown in Christ. Presenting others full-grown in Christ is a very difficult task, a task which can be accomplished only by struggling according to Christ’s operation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qcLWvpSjI1XL62hLozF8aNmkff8b8TaDsla5rdBghIZYVZKEAFjA56Gig5TWSCGAX">THE PRINCIPLE ORDAINED BY GOD</h2><p data-content-id="yrS9bX0cFSGgVgun4Ufhw1Iclc7v6wOF1ONqnoyndBoPJWI5e-rH93nABe6-78JSB"> Some may think that the way to present others full-grown in Christ is to pray. However, it is possible to have a superstitious understanding of prayer. For example, suppose someone thinks that meals can be prepared only by prayer and that there is no need to go shopping or to cook food. Such a concept is superstitious. In presenting others full-grown in Christ we need to follow the principle set up in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92445" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>: Man tills the ground, and God sends the rain (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92446" data-verses="Genesis 2:5">v. 5</span>). On the one hand, we must till the ground. On the other hand, only God can send the rain. As we trust in God and look to Him for the rain, we should be faithful in our responsibility to till the ground. This means that we must fulfill the principle ordained by God. If we depend only on our work of tilling the ground and do not trust in the Lord to send the rain, we are wrong. But we are also wrong if we only pray to the Lord for rain and do not fulfill our responsibility to till the ground. Applying this principle to the matter of presenting every man full-grown in Christ, we see that we should not merely pray, but also labor according to Christ’s operation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="138" id="138">[138]</span> </p>

Not knowing how to connect the vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92449" data-verses="Colossians 1:1">chapter one</span> to this word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92450" data-verses="Colossians 2:1">chapter two</span>, I spent a great deal of time to find out why such a word was inserted. Paul did not say that he struggled so that the Colossians and Laodiceans would see the vision of Christ given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92451" data-verses="Colossians 1:1">chapter one</span>. According to my concept, this is what he should have said. If <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92452" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">verse 2</span> had been written in this way, it would have been much easier for me to understand. Nevertheless, Paul did not say that he struggled so that the saints would exercise their spirits to see what he had shared with them concerning Christ. He struggled that their hearts might be comforted. </p>
<p data-content-id="uei5QW3MGv90tAA2FxD3LJZfbMX-F4R75QFjeBrVrSzVrCFjdoepppbzqxBliOuF8"> Why was it necessary for the hearts of the Colossians to be comforted, knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding? It took years before I could answer this question. Assurance implies two things: faith and knowledge. When we have faith and knowledge, we have certainty about what we believe. This certainty then becomes our assurance. Paul wrestled so that the hearts of the Colossians would have full assurance. </p>
<p data-content-id="f5FHReDvsyzvBMFzyvsIslz0TPVlMYqgmUB6rb4-E6X-5JRriI2ZE461KcHMoNa9f"> The words “unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ” are in apposition to “unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding.” The second “unto” equals the first. Although I could understand certain of these details, I <span class="pg" data-page-id="139" id="139">[139]</span> could not understand the verse as a whole. I simply did not know the reason for this word. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ij7bPPSnYgJ7k5YLk7p3WF7OFuU49jispqhi6sQh09yxxcsmTBisNQ0qrwyEIQciJ"> We thank the Lord that, through the years, He has shown us the reason. As we consider this reason, let us recall that, as sister books, Ephesians is concerned with the church as the Body, whereas Colossians deals with Christ as the Head. Ephesians places great emphasis on the human spirit; it uses the phrase “in spirit” repeatedly. Colossians, however, refers to the human spirit only once (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92453" data-verses="Colossians 2:5">2:5</span>). In Colossians the heart is of crucial significance. Here Paul emphasizes the importance of the heart in receiving the revelation concerning Christ. For years we have spoken about turning to the spirit, exercising the spirit, and abiding in the spirit. However, we have not given as much attention to taking care of the heart. Paul knew that if we would present others full-grown in Christ, we must be concerned about the condition of their hearts. The fact that he concludes <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92454" data-verses="Colossians 1:1">chapter one</span> with a word about presenting every man mature in Christ and opens <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92455" data-verses="Colossians 2:1">chapter two</span> with a word about the comforting of the hearts indicates that presenting others full-grown in the Lord has much to do with the heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="HJXSCv7FjRX11Nlg8l5j7efQn6ngONZ6T3GdC5v5dCb9ChbHCNsZDKBUk5DL1WVtx"> Because of the different observances, ordinances, and philosophies that had crept into the church life, the hearts of the saints in Colosse had been hurt; they had become cold and dissatisfied. Whenever such things come in, the result is always dissension and division. We must guard the door of the church lest such things enter in and cause harm. The church in Colosse had been invaded by Jewish ordinances and observances and by pagan philosophy, mysticism, and asceticism. These things caused the saints to become opinionated, dissenting, and dissatisfied. They also caused the hearts of the saints to be hurt and to become cold, divided, and separated from one another. Therefore, Paul struggled on behalf of the saints that their hearts would be comforted and knit together in love. </p>
<p data-content-id="XqFwK4-uCOxRvgyEbG31TFRJeB3gOw1v26KaLLx9rvafbSffqSmEd1W12EaU8vYF3"> In this verse to be comforted means to be cherished, that is, to be lovingly warmed up. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92456" data-verses="Ephesians 5:29">Ephesians 5:29</span> says that Christ nourishes and cherishes His church. To nourish is to feed, <span class="pg" data-page-id="140" id="140">[140]</span> and to cherish is to make warm. How the saints in Colosse needed the Lord’s cherishing! Their hearts needed to be comforted, to be warmed. </p>
<p data-content-id="kX1nUfZuqQkzrLrgt3NFkih8mBBwQ2eJ9RDPm9pQmA9VJDK3iAAZbqak9qWDfH_Sw"> Paul speaks of the hearts being knit together in love. The words “knit together in love” indicate that some kind of separation had taken place and that there had been a loss of love. The different observances, ordinances, and philosophies that had crept in had caused this loss of love. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="J_nFMNQorB6p2GT8JBzVIJEJggdRIYNHJ9mfOn7jgTGQpHDcX8vywWDQZdhqUypmp">THE HEART AND THE MIND</h2><p data-content-id="zxxKVZo0L_3UdrO9iX46Tdlv0mVHq-fB11uoqtjPBjhY_rEsDeSQDqGrA0qATN0ay"> In this verse Paul deals with two crucial organs of our inner being: the heart and the mind. (The word understanding implies the mind.) Once the heart has been hurt and has become cold and divided, it is easy for the mind to be distracted or even attacked by the enemy. When the mind is in such a condition, it cannot understand the word that is ministered concerning Christ and God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="aw_owglmYsbhVQpnqDeZZJvwTg1pyKPcebdjcPDhLYFI9FSkEF8RpLBEHkqv-h5U3"> Problems in the heart are often the cause of mental problems. If a person’s mind is under attack by the enemy, this is an indication that his heart is wrong in some way. Whenever the heart is wrong, it is easy for the mind to be in darkness or subject to attack. This is an important principle. Most cases of mental illness have their source in problems that exist in the heart. More than forty years ago, the superintendent of a large mental hospital told me that, according to his experience and observation, mental problems are caused by problems related to greed for money and sex. These are problems of the heart. Greed for money causes problems in the hearts of some, whereas lust causes problems in the hearts of others. Such problems cause the mind to come under attack. Through years of experience, we have learned that mental illness can be traced to problems in the heart. The mind is attacked because the heart is wrong. Perhaps someone has a certain ambition or desire in his heart. If this ambition or desire is not fulfilled and is not dealt with, the mind may be attacked. </p>
<p data-content-id="bII_pa96wW65xpS_TOga8Qb0t1Wg1fUpsR-fiE2GZ2XncQE7FKuNnsp2sqi-cXeIt"> Paul no doubt realized this; he knew that it was crucial for the hearts of the Colossians to be comforted and knit <span class="pg" data-page-id="141" id="141">[141]</span> together in love. If their hearts were cared for in a proper way, the saints would have the riches of the full assurance of understanding. Their minds would once again function normally to understand spiritual things. When our hearts are comforted, our minds will function properly. But if there is a problem in our heart, there will be a problem in our mind also. The heart regulates the mind. Whether the mind is normal or abnormal depends on the condition of the heart. </p>

This book is on the mystery of God, which is Christ, the Head. It is crucial that we know Christ not only as our Savior and Lord, but also as the mystery of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="QoYPkMNcmTS0w0HcQG2WFMBh5gpNkMHo00ymhHKS1B0KuZrfvJx-ndqeKB8A9ADgi"> All Christians love the Lord Jesus. The only difference among them in this matter is the degree of their love for Him. Even a backsliding believer loves the Lord to a certain extent. How much we love the Lord depends on how much we know Him and how much we realize concerning Him. For example, a child may appreciate a little box made to contain a diamond ring more than the ring itself. This shows that the degree of love is determined by the degree of appreciation. The more we know the Lord Jesus and appreciate Him, the more we shall love Him. Hence, we need to go on to know the Lord Jesus not only as our Savior and Lord, but also as the mystery of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="KavjviC-d0XiSiopL73LYAPbty-JatCcsRXMlBkeWvyXWct-X5tTcxic3H8-f0epm"> If we would know Christ as the mystery of God, we need to have the full experience of everything covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92471" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">2:2</span>. In this verse Paul says, “That their hearts may be comforted, being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.” The word “unto” means “resulting in.” If the hearts of the Colossians were comforted and knit together in love, the result would be all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, an understanding no doubt related to the mystery of God, Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="146" id="146">[146]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lGebDchapj8MhaQa-6qJi3EWmwf6KQoIEBHfdfUryVbKKL4PAwixxjPTbBKYDu4Le">THE NEED TO EXERCISE OUR WHOLE BEING</h2><p data-content-id="OLv1qDRjKPpb7WeQhnpjddP7nRLMe_5E-1ppPPLq1fp8MR8MpzzfwWWMlwmSEija5"> We cannot contact the Lord or know Him as God’s mystery without exercising our spirit. As we shall see, our whole being needs to be exercised. Every aspect of man’s being—spirit, soul, and body—is complicated. If you spend time examining your face in a mirror, you will be impressed with the complexity of your physical body. Human beings are not simple organisms. In our soul we have the mind, the emotion, and the will. Furthermore, in our spirit we have the conscience, the intuition, and the fellowship. Every part of our complex being must be exercised to receive the revelation of Christ as the mystery of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="NvL9nhfr9y1MfkuCnJjWc5-mCkwZRJH-02hvDSNt9dQdENu8DeMorULDAd59B1LCF"> God Himself is a mystery, and Christ is the mystery of this mystery. Surely we cannot fathom such a mystery simply by reading the letter of the Scriptures. Since Christ dwells in our spirit, we need to exercise our spirit in order to know Him as the mystery of God. Never regard Christ as a mere object to be known in an outward way. As the crucified and resurrected One, He is living both on the throne in the heavens and in our spirit as well. Hence, it is of utmost importance that we exercise our spirit to contact Him. This means that we must open up from the depths of our being and call on Him. Our spirit is our deepest part, deeper than the heart and all the parts of the soul. Therefore, to exercise our spirit is to open the deepest part of our being to call on the name of the Lord Jesus and to contact Him as the living One within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="t5iqp8-G4gD5mGLTCIR_DHqa7Qcd6tluKEbpWrQpW1yZ_muRMBVOIaTGcMROMFrnI"> We are complex, but Christ is far more complex. To know Him, we must not only exercise our spirit, but also have our heart comforted. This means that our heart must be cherished, warmed. Moreover, our mind must be sober, our emotion must be regulated, and our will must be subdued. Every part of our inner being must be proper and function in a normal way. This is the reason Paul speaks of the hearts being comforted in relation to having the full knowledge of Christ as the mystery of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="h3ZNAj-7-mNpWfPCijhB17Zq8ObLJTqT5I-hwnsewSx8Ec6pwTMhh2r5WyeY8HZbS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92472" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">2:2</span> Paul goes on to speak of all the riches of the full assurance of understanding. The comforting of the heart <span class="pg" data-page-id="147" id="147">[147]</span> must have a result. In this case the result is having all the riches of the full assurance of understanding. We need to have such an assurance, for example, concerning the ground of the church. Some saints claim to know the church ground and to be committed to it. However, they are actually quite wishy-washy and have no certainty related to the ground of the church. They have faith, but they do not have the certainty which gives us full assurance. </p>
<p data-content-id="U-smkr1a6dFJm6oEW-7auOkFn8nXeIFwUVyMfwU3YgBr5P5j6Up1AlI-ogYff8uiJ"> Allow me to testify of my experience about becoming assured regarding the ground of the church. In 1932 we began to practice the church life in Chefoo, my hometown. After several months, opposition rose up against us. Before we began to practice the church life, I was loved and respected by the Christian leaders in that city. They regarded me as one who was for the Lord Jesus in an absolute way. However, the attitude of those leaders toward me began to change when more and more of the promising ones began to come into the church. This troubled those Christian leaders, and negative rumors were circulated about us. Furthermore, those who once respected me no longer greeted me when they saw me on the street. Deeply concerned about this, I went to the Lord and inquired about the situation. I asked Him to show me what was wrong. I spent more than a month thoroughly considering the matter before the Lord. Eventually I concluded that if I were to be a man, I had to believe in the Lord Jesus; that if I were to believe in the Lord, I had to love Him; and that if I were to love Him, I had to take the way of the church. As a result, I received the full assurance concerning the ground of the church. I had not only faith, but also the knowledge which caused me to have certainty. For more than forty-six years I have not changed my position with respect to the church ground, no matter how much I have suffered because of the stand I have taken. Some co-workers who used to be close to me betrayed me because they were afraid to face opposition regarding the church ground. Some of them had even given messages on the ground of the church. But actually they were wishy-washy. They did not have the full assurance of understanding that Paul speaks of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92473" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">2:2</span>. Paul realized that <span class="pg" data-page-id="148" id="148">[148]</span> concerning the mystery of God, Christ, the believers needed certainty, the assurance that comes from faith and knowledge. Those who have such an assurance are not wishy-washy in this matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="MbvcrlXtA4GGPOZNOvDot4_k6JkO4-YWsRhB1iUfY2NjrQ3EE-RVlAKh7NIKw-9kI"> After making my decision about the ground of the church, I spent some time with Brother Nee in Shanghai during a period of turmoil. Attempting to comfort him, I said, “Brother Nee, I am one with you because you are taking the Lord’s way. I assure you, even if you turn from this way, I will not change my mind. I have the full assurance concerning the Lord’s way in the church.” This is the full assurance of understanding that Paul speaks of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92474" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">2:2</span>. Concerning Christ as the mystery of God, we need faith, knowledge, certainty, and thorough understanding. </p>
<p data-content-id="Vehc_DxwcgXUMWVvg6ZqRxQAc_2kSJcmilbKcMYbZp13kc_c_BsTJjIrnVSGak81f"> The Colossians did not have the full assurance concerning Christ. Otherwise, they would not have turned to the worship of angels or taken in such things as observances, ordinances, and philosophies. On the one hand, they had received Christ and knew something about Him. On the other hand, their knowledge of Christ was not with the full assurance of understanding. The Colossians definitely believed in the Lord Jesus and held to the faith. But they did not have all the riches of the full assurance of understanding. They knew that Christ was the Son of God, and they had received Him. However, because they were rather wishy-washy, they also accepted various observances, ordinances, and philosophies. </p>
<p data-content-id="iiCXRFpuXcPrT8Ib2ei9Wmk1GmJyhe2ws6tpqdIZHirz4qBni4rQoR_fScofdndKl"> If we would have all the riches of the full assurance of understanding concerning Christ as the mystery of God, every part of our being must be exercised. We should not be wishy-washy in any way. I am concerned for those in the Lord’s recovery who have never exercised themselves in a full way. Due to this lack of exercise, they may not have the full assurance of understanding concerning the recovery. </p>

We shall consider a number of points which help us experience Christ in this way. </p>

TO HAVE THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF HIM<br/>AS THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="DoDlSswZom_4i2OTnuzO3QHEF6cZxAJ-vevsKnj9CyhxI_r5snfUvFBDoS7HJ6EHS"> If we would experience Christ as the mystery of God, we need to have the full knowledge of Him as God’s mystery. We have pointed out that Paul struggled for the Colossians that their hearts would be comforted “unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92493" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">2:2</span>). In order to have the full knowledge of such a mystery, our whole being needs to be exercised. If we simply believe in Christ without loving Him, we cannot have this knowledge. Likewise, if we love Him partially but not wholly, we cannot have the full knowledge of Him. We need to love the Lord Jesus with our whole being. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92494" data-verses="Mark 12:30">Mark 12:30</span>, quoting <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92495" data-verses="Deuteronomy 6:5">Deuteronomy 6:5</span>, says, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.” When our entire being is exercised to love the Lord Jesus, we shall gain the full knowledge of Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sr4B7OdLi_gaxbmxLXiEYa2SR16IO5vLZGWdu23POQDxs7Xqf3z_YUMIa59gSQKwD"> Some Christians are fond of the hymn, “Oh, how I love Jesus.” However, this hymn may be sung in a superficial way; it is not according to the full knowledge of Christ as the mystery of God. Only by exercising our entire being can we know Christ in this way. </p>
<p data-content-id="ggDaF55GyBbxJPqPBphLCbZaaMRKVmgCTqIDR3goq-SVfvSN8prg0TR811vkyUmRZ"> I recommend that all the saints in the Lord’s recovery study three crucial books in the New Testament: Matthew, <span class="pg" data-page-id="154" id="154">[154]</span> John, and Hebrews. A number of helpful Life-study messages have been given on these books. The studies on John and Hebrews are especially thorough. If you spend adequate time on these three books, you will gain a considerable amount of knowledge concerning Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="aw_owglmYsbhVQpnqDeZZJvwTjVpyIPcebdjcPDhLYFI9FSkEF8RpLBEHkqv-h5U3">II. TO RECEIVE HIM</h2><p data-content-id="bII_pa96wW65xpS_TOga8Qb0t22g1dUpsR-fiE2GZ2XncQE7FKuNnsp2sqi-cXeIt"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92496" data-verses="Colossians 2:6">2:6</span> Paul says that the Colossians “have received Christ Jesus the Lord.” Christ is the portion of the saints (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92497" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">1:12</span>) for our enjoyment. To believe in Him is to receive Him. As the all-inclusive Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92498" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>), He enters into us and dwells in our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92499" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">2 Tim. 4:22</span>) to be everything to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="qcLWvpSjI1XL62hLozF8aNmkfccb7BaDsla5rdBghIZYVZKEAFjA56Gig5TWSCGAX"> Once we have received Christ Jesus, we need not receive Him again. But we must apply what we have received. However, only a very small percentage of those who have received Christ apply Him. We all must practice to apply the living Christ in a practical way day by day. To employ a common term, we need to use Christ. For more than fifty years, I have been learning how to use Christ. I can testify that this is difficult because by birth it is not natural for us to use Christ, nor does our training condition us to use Him. Recently, most of my confession to the Lord has been related to my failure to apply Him. The hardest lesson for us to learn as Christians is to apply Christ and to use Him. We have heard a number of messages on living Christ, growing Christ, and producing Christ. Nevertheless, in our daily living we spontaneously use the self instead of Christ. There is no need for us to try to use the self; we use it automatically and spontaneously. </p>
<p data-content-id="yrS9bX0cFSGgVgun4Ufhw1Iclfbv8ieF1ONqnoyndBoPJWI5e-rH93nABe6-78JSB"> In the Gospels the Lord charges us to “watch and pray.” I have spent a number of years considering this word. At first I thought that this command was not necessary. But eventually I learned that I certainly need to watch and pray, especially in the matter of applying Christ. As we are waking up in the morning, we need to be watchful not to do anything without applying Christ. Often as we wake up early in the morning, it seems that demons are swarming around the headboard of the bed. Although we are protected <span class="pg" data-page-id="155" id="155">[155]</span> by the Lord and covered with His prevailing blood, we still need to be watchful and resist the evil thoughts injected into us by the enemy. Do not think about anything without applying Christ. We certainly need to be on the alert; that is, we need to be watchful and to pray. But very few Christians watch and pray in order to apply Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="8W3SYV3ote4j4Rg0nTLNGDsadU7YGmmEc9qelKbjNksm4WKd2cErScxTa7rBwQTLq"> Although we have all received the Lord Jesus, we are very short in using Him, in applying Him. If we fail to apply Him, then in a practical way in our daily living there is little significance to having received Him. Our experience of Christ should not be so superficial, and we should not take so many things for granted. We are thankful for God’s salvation in Christ, and we are grateful that we have received Him. But now we must go on to apply the very One we have received. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0dvJwNTlnFFL7ZQjBM_mXPhF8h7x0SI_QdjxYstvjmR9qWy9nTfOsrOtXWOoopoj0">III. TO BE ROOTED IN HIM</h2><p data-content-id="7cuojx9EnikxgkGvSa0_PvMZPnR3cME5yo0N_UaqITA8UbezEJgBcuGWFgD9_1aau"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92500" data-verses="Colossians 2:7">2:7</span> Paul speaks of having been rooted in Christ. To be rooted in Him is for the growth in life. In this verse Paul views the believers as plants who have been rooted in Christ as the soil. However, many Christians have not been rooted in Christ adequately. </p>
<p data-content-id="_0z4CjgcRAzGySPl6nQ9kckrS-MiI0FLuxfmejJOVBUIS_-qK7UtCn7ND1Qwyrk2f"> If we have been rooted in Christ properly, there will be no need to talk much about the ground of the church. The ground of the church is oneness. But the base of this oneness is the one Spirit, the one Lord, and the one God and Father, as mentioned by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92501" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">Ephesians 4</span>. If we have been truly rooted in Christ, in our experience He will be the base of our oneness. Some Seventh-Day Adventists consider the keeping of the Sabbath another testimony on earth in addition to the local churches. Such a statement indicates a lack of being rooted in Christ. If we have been rooted in Him deeply and properly, we would never say that God has set up another testimony. God’s unique testimony is Jesus Christ. If we have been rooted in Him, nothing will be able to distract us from Him. We all should be able to say, “Lord Jesus, I thank You that I have been rooted in You. I have no standing apart from You.” In the Lord’s recovery we can testify that our ground is Christ and Christ alone. <span class="pg" data-page-id="156" id="156">[156]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="BOCvS1r-7tIB54EhOvqqTqjp2okq6Ypvx43xAqzzl996JaIsWLw395nl-aNWe_mB3"> If we consider the situation of today’s Christianity, we shall see that the various denominations and independent groups have something other than Christ as their ground. The Seventh-Day Adventists have as their ground the keeping of the seventh day, whereas the ground of the Baptist denomination is baptism by immersion. Some denominations, such as the Church of Christ, go so far as to insist that only in their water can a believer be baptized properly. Although some groups insist on baptism by immersion, others oppose it; they claim that baptism is strictly spiritual and in the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="xhOwCJPMz8poSokM7QjIveWcWWVv-XtC3D97biFQx_aZezgsPp4uXJaG_Tl_jpc6R"> In 1964 I met a man who argued strongly against baptism in water. He insisted that the baptism spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92502" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span> refers to baptism in the Spirit. He interpreted every New Testament reference to baptism after John the Baptist as baptism in the Spirit. He even became quite angry when his position was challenged according to certain verses. A few days later as I was ministering in a certain place, I was challenged by a woman from the Church of Christ concerning water baptism. Just a few days prior, a man argued with me about baptism in the Spirit. Now a woman boldly asked about water baptism. Neither this man nor this woman had been adequately rooted in Christ. This illustrates the shameful fact that Christians are divided because they take as their ground something other than Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="riqDpjchUDoSOoMli_WZl-Ii1oMFHOtu7gQhs2g1WdrF9hCb4rF0iMESoWGxdqC3t"> Paul realized the importance of being rooted in Christ. He knew that it was a serious matter to be transplanted from Christ and to be rooted in something else, such as heathen philosophy or Jewish ordinances. He wanted the Colossians to see that philosophy was not the soil in which they had been rooted. They had been rooted in Christ. He is our unique soil. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="d9yHx1EHlCF0Nc2ISA4iR70qFb0B39DQsAr0x-_n5uKwoGhkDJWrhSt-NWfOCM6YO">IV. TO BE BUILT UP IN HIM</h2><p data-content-id="QoYPkMNcmTS0w0HcQG2WFMBh5g5NgeHo00ymhHKS1B0KuZrfvJx-ndqeKB8A9ADgi"> Having been rooted in Christ, we now are “being built up in Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92503" data-verses="Colossians 2:7">2:7</span>). To be built up is for the building of the Body. Although we have been rooted, we are still in the process of being built up. This is a corporate matter as well as a <span class="pg" data-page-id="157" id="157">[157]</span> personal matter. A building is not composed merely of one item, but of many items that have been fitted together. We need to be rooted in Christ and also built up in the church. </p>

<p data-content-id="U-smkr1a6dFJm6oEW-7auOkFk-nXaaVwUVyMfwU3YgBr5P5j6Up1AlI-ogYff8uiJ"> In the previous message we spoke about experiencing Christ as the mystery of God. Now we shall go on to consider how to walk in such a Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92519" data-verses="Colossians 2:6">2:6</span> Paul says, “As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.” To walk in Christ as the mystery of God is to live, act, behave, and have our being in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="MbvcrlXtA4GGPOZNOvDot4_k5LkO_t4WsRhB1iUfY2NjrQ3EE-RVlAKh7NIKw-9kI"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92520" data-verses="Colossians 1:1">chapter one</span> of Colossians Paul presents a profound revelation of Christ. The first aspect of Christ unveiled in this chapter is Christ as the portion of the saints (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92521" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">v. 12</span>). The good land in the Old Testament typifies Christ as the saints’ portion or lot. In this chapter Paul also shows that Christ is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, the Head of the Body, the firstborn from among the dead, and the One in whom all the fullness is pleased to dwell. </p>
<p data-content-id="Vehc_DxwcgXUMWVvg6ZqRxQAf92kUasmilbKcMYbZp13kc_c_BsTJjIrnVSGak81f"> Paul opens <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92522" data-verses="Colossians 2:1">chapter two</span> with a word about his great struggle for the Colossians that their hearts would be comforted “unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92523" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">v. 2</span>). Only when the hearts of the saints in Colosse were comforted, cherished, and warmed, could they have a proper understanding of Christ. This would enable them to have the genuine experience of Christ. The Colossians needed a comforted heart and a sober mind in order to have the full knowledge of the Christ they had received and from whom they had been distracted. This Christ, the mystery of God, is the One in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92524" data-verses="Colossians 2:3">v. 3</span>). Furthermore, He is the One in whom all the <span class="pg" data-page-id="162" id="162">[162]</span> fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92525" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">2:9</span>). Once the Colossians had the full assurance of understanding concerning the all-inclusive Christ, they could then walk in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="iiCXRFpuXcPrT8Ib2ei9Wmk1FkJyoN2ws6tpqdIZHirz4qBni4rQoR_fScofdndKl"> We have pointed out that the word walk in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92526" data-verses="Colossians 2:6">2:6</span> means to live, act, behave, and have our being. The One in whom we are to walk is the all-inclusive One who is revealed in a profound way in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92527" data-verses="Colossians 1:1">chapter one</span>. As such a One, Christ is the portion of the saints and the mystery of God’s economy. Like the Colossians, we need to be exhorted to walk in the Christ who is everything to us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1aJmujdY8zf3BLa1Nx2x7qmP28SUFz-3l_vTi90iiOmndjKLwrW8aLxpNk6UPXsej">OUR GOOD LAND</h2><p data-content-id="9CMGouSfiMWAlo_AF78CKdna-3H81qeYi6ay6JvhbqmWxQR8qwvMZ9jTvWt74Euid"> As Paul was writing this chapter of Colossians, he was considering the picture of the good land in the Old Testament as a type of the all-inclusive Christ. There is a suggestion of this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92528" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">1:12</span>, where Paul says that Christ is the portion of the saints. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92529" data-verses="Colossians 2:6">2:6</span> Paul tells us to walk in Christ. This implies that Christ is the land, the territory, the realm, in which we may walk. Furthermore, his reference to being rooted in Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92530" data-verses="Colossians 2:7">2:7</span> also indicates that he was thinking of the good land. In order to be rooted in Christ, He must be our land, our soil. All these are indications that the Christ revealed in Colossians is our good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="jSqu1fKMETv3AEO0jRP6XSxNEaB2byZ3Bj8ZR-J9t-t3Qs846TNRWzfLsChMbFjod"> Paul had a strong background in the Old Testament. As he was writing such Epistles as Romans, 1
Corinthians, Galatians, Colossians, and Hebrews, he must have had the Old Testament Scriptures very much in mind, and he wrote many things according to them. In particular, as Paul was writing the book of Colossians, he had before him the picture of the land of Canaan. He was aware that God’s chosen people in Old Testament times enjoyed the good land as their portion. Furthermore, he realized that the good land was everything to them. It was through the good land that they could worship God and build the temple for God’s testimony and for His unique dwelling place. It was through the good land that God’s purpose could be fulfilled through the children of Israel. Fully realizing what the good land meant to God’s chosen people, Paul composed the Epistle to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="163" id="163">[163]</span> Colossians with the portrait of the good land in mind. Therefore, if we would experience the all-inclusive Christ as revealed in this book, we need to realize that such a Christ is typified by the land of Canaan. The Christ who is typified by the good land is the processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit. I admit that I emphasize this point again and again. This is my commission and burden from the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="Twq0tWAMk6bVuZEt9Z9lD5HOFRoTRtodL3jAfCQiy5hBnTJuAz_YAL8NdDTj2RtGV"> If we would walk in Christ as the mystery of God, we must see that, according to Paul’s concept, the Christ in whom we are to walk is the good land. Concerning this matter, we need the full assurance of understanding. Message after message could be given on the subject of Christ as the good land. This matter is inexhaustible. </p>
<p data-content-id="nAAjrYoSxORsKcXED0Y92nk_kOG8eCLYu242cBU-V2b50Voz0s71JJrl7esVgPqMx"> The first major conference held in the United States in December, 1962, was on the all-inclusive Christ typified by the land of Canaan. Those messages have been published as <em>The All-Inclusive Christ.</em> A very good hymn on the experience of Christ as life was inspired by these messages. The last stanza of this hymn (<em>Hymns,</em> #499) is given below: </p>

<p data-content-id="F8T5SrvVvSK9adYDT1faMIT2sIEYQcuvvK68nXJGmPygBYfXAuqVH6_7nXxzbpNoL"> In that conference a number of messages were given on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92531" data-verses="Deuteronomy 8:7-10">Deuteronomy 8:7-10</span>. Based on these verses, we considered the unsearchable riches of the land: the water, the food, and the minerals. What we shared in those messages was only an introductory word. A great deal remains to be said about the riches of Christ typified by the land of Canaan. </p>
<p data-content-id="CV0IHBXEspCOWkPgBxpK-FPjuRa4JuV2YOitnjJYe71lPdJfo-RTTzkzgsHXnVKBu"> Students of the Word realize that the Bible is not easy to understand. When I was a young Christian, I told the Lord that I did not agree with the way He wrote the Bible. According to my opinion, He should have written it in a systematic way, covering each of the major points systematically and putting all the material together under various <span class="pg" data-page-id="164" id="164">[164]</span> major headings and subdivisions. Nevertheless, we must recognize that the Lord’s way is the best. In the Bible the Lord speaks about a particular subject in various places. Take justification as an example. This subject is covered in more than one book. Because our capacity is so limited, the Lord knew that He could reveal only a little at a time concerning spiritual matters such as justification. This is true all the more of the revelation of Christ as our good land. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="P48e1Zv0yLRjkEdD3vDxRlw0uxdxAAysNs7_pSaWHLCXEoMkdyKlIfpN-GyxhQQiF">AN ALL-INCLUSIVE TYPE OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="-8P5_We9HlrZyO3mbt2-Dnw29HRjk25MPtZfEzTH8mFI2NJZdM2qdWpYHt1XsAb0_"> On the one hand, the good land is revealed in the Old Testament. On the other hand, it is concealed there. Although this statement appears contradictory, actually it is not. Because Deuteronomy describes the good land, we may say that the good land is revealed in the Old Testament. But because the meaning and significance of the good land are concealed, we may also say that the land is concealed in the Scriptures. As the Lord’s children, supplied by His mercy and grace, delved into the Word, they began to realize that the good land promised by God to His chosen people is a type of Christ. If the Passover enjoyed in Egypt and the manna experienced in the wilderness were types of Christ, then the good land must also be a type of Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="RfNO2lIzA5Rw54npqQTHNA_TIi86a9wgvd8yXLZ0NJhLX6FOEZQflozxR78uf33Oy"> According to typology, the children of Israel enjoyed Christ in three stages: in Egypt, in the wilderness, and in the good land. The Passover enjoyed in Egypt was not only for their redemption; it also strengthened them to make their exodus from Egypt. In the wilderness God’s people were sustained by manna, which enabled them to build God’s tabernacle and to carry it as a testimony. After the children of Israel entered into the good land, they began to enjoy the rich produce of the land. This produce made it possible for them to build the temple for a more solid testimony. Speaking according to the type, the temple in the good land is the focus of God’s purpose on earth. God desires to have a dwelling place among His chosen people for His expression. God’s purpose is fulfilled neither by the enjoyment of Christ as the Passover lamb in Egypt nor by the enjoyment of Christ as manna in the wilderness. His purpose is fulfilled only when His people enjoy Christ as their good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="sQ-jiCKNjXFon2Sit_5DdVXU6dyLVoqUaRJLlAaDAC4Gkuj3zqfMcEH9tudAOZTWi"> In 1 Corinthians we see that Paul dealt with the Corinthians according to the first two stages of the enjoyment of Christ, but not according to the third stage. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92550" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:7">1 Corinthians 5:7</span> he says, “For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.” In the following verse he charges us to “keep the feast.” These verses point to the enjoyment of Christ as the Passover in Egypt. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92551" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:3-4">1 Corinthians 10:3 and 4</span> Paul refers to spiritual food and spiritual drink. This refers to the enjoyment of Christ in the wilderness. In 1 Corinthians there is no mention of the third stage of the enjoyment of Christ. But in Colossians Paul <span class="pg" data-page-id="170" id="170">[170]</span> regarded the believers as being in this stage of the enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="wrbcmMjVyCQkgWdRivfLA0DYvtUMNq-d3uqzGEffBGQc6UVl06Y-KY2UHVu1-W7x4"> Because the Corinthians were not in the third stage of the enjoyment of Christ, the church life in that locality was a tabernacle church life, a church life that was portable and that lacked a solid foundation. By contrast, the church life in Ephesians, Colossians, and Philippians is that of the temple. It is a settled church life with a solid foundation. Stone was not used in the building of the tabernacle, but a great deal of stone was used in constructing the temple. For this reason, the temple, the enlargement of the tabernacle, was solid and settled. </p>
<p data-content-id="LGGjP-PAOdJ8nFxUYQbpLuUq1AMMZ8ShMQZw72ekAlg3c478l-zKR4IjWE4Bf53rA"> The church life in Colossians and Ephesians is more solid than that in 1 Corinthians because in these Epistles the enjoyment of Christ is not elementary. It is not merely the enjoyment of Christ as the Passover or as the manna, but the enjoyment of Christ as the good land, as the portion of the saints. Today some churches may be in the first or second stage of the enjoyment of Christ, whereas others may be in the third stage. </p>
<p data-content-id="mLlsVgAIb-skAhfjqngkuMQK2-RugRA-Eh0Y8vVQpH3WrdTCEmNX27ibG0XFE_F6p"> If we would enter into the good land, we must conquer and subdue all the enemies typified by the seven tribes. These enemies are the evil rulers, authorities, principalities, and powers in the air. After these enemies have been defeated, we shall have peace, and in this peace the temple can be built. </p>

<p data-content-id="riqDpjchUDoSOoMli_WZl-Ii2qMFEONu7gQhs2g1WdrF9hCb4rF0iMESoWGxdqC3t"> Although the Colossians were in Christ as the good land, they had been deluded, deceived. This was the reason that Paul said in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92552" data-verses="Colossians 2:4">2:4</span>, “This I say that no one may delude you with persuasive speech.” </p>
<p data-content-id="d9yHx1EHlCF0Nc2ISA4iR70qGZ0B09jQsAr0x-_n5uKwoGhkDJWrhSt-NWfOCM6YO"> In order for believers to be deluded, something close to the truth must be used to deceive them. For example, counterfeit money or forged checks are deceptive because their appearance is close to that of the real things. People would never be deceived by money or by checks that are obviously <span class="pg" data-page-id="171" id="171">[171]</span> false. In like manner, the Colossians were deceived by observances and practices that were close to the experience of Christ. Furthermore, certain aspects of Gnosticism were similar to the teachings of the Bible. For this reason, the Colossians could be deceived. </p>
<p data-content-id="QoYPkMNcmTS0w0HcQG2WFMBh6i5Njfno00ymhHKS1B0KuZrfvJx-ndqeKB8A9ADgi"> It is very easy to be deceived by something that is close to the real thing, by a counterfeit that is almost identical to something genuine. Without the proper discernment, it is difficult to see the difference between the teachings in the New Testament and ethical teachings like those of Confucius. When I was young, I heard a missionary say that the ethical teachings of Confucius were the same as some teachings in the Bible. The Bible teaches that wives should submit to their husbands. Confucius, however, teaches a threefold submission. Firstly, a woman is to submit to her father; then to her husband; and then, should her husband die, to her son. Concerning submission, the teachings of Confucius and the teachings of the Bible appear to be the same in principle. If we do not have discernment, we could be led astray from Christ by ethical teachings that appear to be the same as those of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="KavjviC-d0XiSiopL73LYAPbuwuJc-ycsRXMlBkeWvyXWct-X5tTcxic3H8-f0epm"> Many aspects of the Jewish religion are very good. Take, for example, the dietary regulations in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92553" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">Leviticus 11</span> and the commandment to keep the Sabbath. It seems right that, just as God rested on the seventh day after laboring for six days, man should have a day of rest after six days of labor. However, there is a problem here. According to the Bible, should we labor first and then rest, or should we rest first and then labor? We may think that because God rested after working for six days, we should do the same. But if we have light from God, we shall see that in the Scriptures God first labors and then rests, but man first rests and then works. Man was created on the sixth day, toward the end of the six days of God’s labor. After the creation of man, God rested, and man rested with God. This indicates that as soon as man came into being, he had a time of rest. Therefore, according to the principle in the Bible, we are to rest before we work. In the New Testament we see that first we receive grace, and then we <span class="pg" data-page-id="172" id="172">[172]</span> work. To work before receiving grace is to live according to the law. But to receive grace before we work is according to God’s salvation by grace. If we are not clear about this, we may be deceived by the teaching of the Seventh-Day Adventists regarding the keeping of the Sabbath. We need to tell the Seventh-Day Adventists that with God work came before rest, but with us rest comes before work. According to the New Testament, receiving grace precedes working. If we do not receive grace as the capital, we shall have nothing with which to work. We cannot work unless we first receive grace. This is a basic principle. </p>
<p data-content-id="lGebDchapj8MhaQa-6qJi3EWlyP6DDoIEBHfdfUryVbKKL4PAwixxjPTbBKYDu4Le"> These examples show that certain observances and teachings are similar to some aspects of God’s salvation. This was the reason that the believers in Colosse could be deceived by Jewish observances and pagan teachings and could allow those things to pervade the church life. I am concerned that the young ones may be deluded by those who advocate certain teachings or practices. We need to have a thorough understanding of the basic principles in the New Testament. Then we shall have the wisdom and the knowledge to convince and subdue those who attempt to delude us. </p>
<p data-content-id="OLv1qDRjKPpb7WeQhnpjddP7kTbMWspE-1ppPPLq1fp8MR8MpzzfwWWMlwmSEija5"> Paul opens <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92554" data-verses="Colossians 2:4">2:4</span> with the words, “This I say.” These words refer to what Paul has covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92555" data-verses="Colossians 2:2-3">verses 2 and 3</span> concerning the riches of the full assurance of understanding, the full knowledge of Christ as the mystery of God, and the fact that all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ. Paul emphasized these things so that the saints at Colosse would not be deluded. If we have seen the revelation of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92556" data-verses="Colossians 1:1">Colossians 1</span>, we shall not be deceived by teachings concerning such things as water baptism and the observance of the Sabbath. We shall know that the all-inclusive Christ is the focus of God’s economy and everything to us. If we have a clear vision of Christ, no one will be able to delude us or deceive us. </p>

With Persuasive Speech</h2><p data-content-id="omf13Bx02SFTK6-4sHpHdKgU3aGji8SgyrvnjZRmemRqzlC_dbZvNK2s_tofFhghm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92557" data-verses="Colossians 2:4">verse 4</span> Paul specifically refers to “persuasive speech.” Usually those who deceive others are eloquent and persuasive <span class="pg" data-page-id="173" id="173">[173]</span> in speech. Beware of eloquence. A speaker may be very eloquent, but there may be no reality in his speech. Instead of being taken in by a speaker’s eloquence, we should ask if there is reality in his speaking. </p>

Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92574" data-verses="Colossians 2:10">verse 10</span> he goes on to say, “And you in Him are made full, Who is the Head of all rule and authority.” In Christ we lack nothing, for in Him we have been perfected and completed. There is no reason for us to turn to anything other than Christ. As we shall see, in speaking these words Paul was dealing with the matter of angel worship. </p>
<p data-content-id="piRKMgn5tqXQZ3-2TvISTCkGKvg08DZjTePG4ht9Tcd7P32I3OUf8n-_v44p36SzH"> Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92575" data-verses="Colossians 2:11">verse 11</span> Paul says that we were circumcised in Christ. To be made full in Him is positive, whereas to be circumcised is to deal with something negative, in particular, the flesh, the self, and the natural man. All these things have been removed by the circumcision which is in Christ. In this message we need to consider how in Christ, on the positive side, we have been made full and, on the negative side, we have been circumcised. </p>

<p data-content-id="2KhgJ0DuKwQnI2lO6O2N5dgXsebpSz9kMP3qeHnY675TwiRdcLBNxgl-yEWidZOr3"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92576" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">2:9</span> Paul says, “For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.” This means that Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, that the fullness of the Triune God dwells in Christ in a bodily form. The fact that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily means that it dwells in Him in a way that is both real and practical. <span class="pg" data-page-id="178" id="178">[178]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="LGGjP-PAOdJ8nFxUYQbpLuUq1A8MQuyhMQZw72ekAlg3c478l-zKR4IjWE4Bf53rA">B. Made Full in Christ</h2><p data-content-id="mLlsVgAIb-skAhfjqngkuMQK2-huoDw-Eh0Y8vVQpH3WrdTCEmNX27ibG0XFE_F6p"> Because all the fullness of the Godhead is in Christ and because we have been placed in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92577" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Cor. 1:30</span>), we have been made full in Him. The New Testament reveals clearly that all those who believe in Christ have been put into Christ. Therefore, we are identified with Him and one with Him. The result is that all He is and all He has belongs to us, and all that He has experienced is our history. We inherit all that Christ has experienced and passed through. Furthermore, because we are one with Him, we partake of all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZIaYAIUhlPYkrS-W4qNUAjewXdu-Mf35Enf7GKa9aNGLCeSPPJyL_qRbhaKXPVpri"> Marriage is an illustration of this. Suppose a poor woman marries a very rich man. Because she is joined to her husband and identified with him, she partakes of all that he is and has. Likewise, we are members of the all-inclusive Christ. We have been put into Him, identified with Him, truly “married” to Him. Hence, we are one with Him. All that He has passed through is now our history, and all that He has obtained and attained is our inheritance. We are in such a Christ, and He is in us. We have been placed into Him, we are one with Him, and we receive all that He is and has. </p>
<p data-content-id="A9Ho75-1IEWiI5pZAWtoolFIAE6Nq_gDjip1OYh6Z3Q5wGMSc15rgkFYdiHX9QQ7d"> Although some Christians have a doctrinal knowledge of this, a mere mental understanding of our union with Christ is not adequate. We need to exercise faith in order to partake of all that is ours in Christ. We should not consider ourselves poor, just as a poor woman who has married a rich man should no longer think of herself as poor. Even though she may feel poor, she must practice applying the fact that the riches of her husband belong to her. In like manner, because we are one with Christ, we should not regard ourselves as in poverty. To the contrary, we need to have a full realization of what we have in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="F8T5SrvVvSK9adYDT1faMIT2sIkYTdOvvK68nXJGmPygBYfXAuqVH6_7nXxzbpNoL"> In their prayers, some Christians like to declare how poor, pitiful, and low they are. This kind of prayer is without faith or assurance. We need to believe with full assurance that we are one with the rich, all-inclusive Christ, with the <span class="pg" data-page-id="179" id="179">[179]</span> One who is the embodiment of all the fullness of the Triune God. If we realize this with full assurance, we shall never consider ourselves poor. </p>
<p data-content-id="CV0IHBXEspCOWkPgBxpK-FPjuR64Kv12YOitnjJYe71lPdJfo-RTTzkzgsHXnVKBu"> Do not believe your feelings about yourself, but look away to Christ. Exercise your faith to realize what He is, what He has passed through, what He has obtained and attained, and where He is today. Since He is in the third heaven and we are one with Him, we are in the third heaven also. In Christ we are not only millionaires—we are billionaires. We have been placed into the Christ who is unsearchably rich. </p>
<p data-content-id="P48e1Zv0yLRjkEdD3vDxRlw0ux9xDASsNs7_pSaWHLCXEoMkdyKlIfpN-GyxhQQiF"> In this Christ we are made perfect, complete. In Him we do not lack anything. Do not talk about how much you lack. Because you are in Christ, you lack nothing. In Him is the fullness, the perfection, the completion. Actually, He Himself is the fullness, perfection, and completion. Because we are in Him, we are complete and perfect; we lack nothing. We are those who possess the riches of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="-8P5_We9HlrZyO3mbt2-Dnw29Hxjn2ZMPtZfEzTH8mFI2NJZdM2qdWpYHt1XsAb0_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92578" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span> Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ. We are more than billionaires because the riches we have are greater than can be counted. We simply have no idea what vast riches we possess in Christ. Often we have prayed, “Lord, I am poor and pitiful.” But not many have prayed in this way: “Lord, I thank You that I am rich, complete, and full. Lord Jesus, because I am in You, I am richer than the wealthiest billionaire. I am short of nothing.” I hope that after reading this message, you will begin to pray in this way. Tell the Lord, the angels, and even the demons that you are richer than any earthly billionaire because you are in the Christ whose riches are unsearchable. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="piRKMgn5tqXQZ3-2TvISTCkGKvg07T5jTePG4ht9Tcd7P32I3OUf8n-_v44p36SzH">C.

The rule and authority spoken of here are the angelic powers, in particular the fallen angels who still occupy positions of power. According to the full revelation of the Bible, after God created the universe, He placed it under the control of an archangel and other leading angels. When this archangel <span class="pg" data-page-id="180" id="180">[180]</span> rebelled against God and became Satan, many of the leading angels who assisted him in ruling the universe became the evil rulers and authorities in the heavenlies. These are described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92580" data-verses="Ephesians 6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span> as the rulers, the authorities, the world-rulers of this darkness, the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies. These angelic powers rule over the nations. For this reason, in the book of Daniel there is mention both of the prince of Greece and of the prince of Persia. (A prince here denotes one of the angelic powers or rulers.) This means that all the nations on earth today are under the rule of authorities in the heavenlies; however, not all of these are evil. But Christ is the Head of all rule and authority. </p>
<p data-content-id="W0UKyOT0t1IBxSIccUYMsUMOnRrZ0dfJmT-k52DOjH1qiyrn6ODlKeTuGk-ooeEF4"> Since Christ is our perfection and completion, we do not need other rules and authorities as objects of adoration, for He is the Head of all these. Remember that the Colossians had been led astray to the worship of angels. Therefore, Paul told them that since Christ is the Head of all the angels and since we are in Him, there is no need for us to worship angels. </p>

This is to abolish the law of the commandments in ordinances (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92602" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">Eph. 2:15</span>). This kills the heresy of keeping the Judaistic rituals. </p>
<p data-content-id="bII_pa96wW65xpS_TOga8Qb0u0Wg9PkpsR-fiE2GZ2XncQE7FKuNnsp2sqi-cXeIt"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92603" data-verses="Colossians 2:15">verse 15</span> Paul continues, “Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it.” The Greek for “stripping off” can also be rendered “putting off,” as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92604" data-verses="Colossians 3:9">3:9</span>. The rulers and authorities spoken of in this verse are the angelic rulers and authorities. Because of the heretical teaching of angel worship at Colosse, the passage here refers to the evil angels. The law was given through angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92605" data-verses="Acts 7:53">Acts 7:53</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92606" data-verses="Galatians 3:19">Gal. 3:19</span>). Based upon this, the heretical teachers at Colosse advocated the worship of angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92607" data-verses="Colossians 2:18">Col. 2:18</span>) as mediators between God and man. Hence, the apostle dealt with this heresy by unveiling the fact that the law, consisting of ordinances, was nailed to the cross (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92608" data-verses="Colossians 2:14">v. 14</span>), and the leading evil angels were stripped off from God. This left Christ as the sole Mediator, who is the Head of all rule and authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92609" data-verses="Colossians 2:10">v. 10</span>). This kills the heresy of angel worship. </p>
<p data-content-id="4IBzwnFeZUmiPTldQylpqjfn96EuxJheAumWT0F5vBeYLZvZUxnAH8UtbPcg2OgXO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92610" data-verses="Colossians 2:13">verses 13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92611" data-verses="Colossians 2:14">14</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92612" data-verses="Colossians 2:15">15</span> the pronoun He refers to God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92613" data-verses="Colossians 2:12">verse 12</span>. The Greek word for make a display means show or exhibit in the sense of putting to an open shame. God openly shamed the evil angelic rulers and authorities on the cross and triumphed over them in it. The Greek words translated “in it” refer to the cross, but they can also be rendered in Him, referring to Christ. </p>

God’s desire is to enliven human beings who are dead in offenses. In order to enliven us, He must put His very life into us. When His life comes into us, we are enlivened, made alive. </p>

The Colossians still regarded the law and the angels very highly. They placed a <span class="pg" data-page-id="189" id="189">[189]</span> high value on the ordinances of the law, and they were even worshipping certain of the angels. Although God has used both the law and the angels, in the economy of His salvation there is no place either for the law or for the angels. Angels are not admitted into the sphere of God’s salvation. Every believer has an angel, but these angels do not share in God’s salvation. Christ’s redemption has nothing to do with angels. In the realm of God’s economy in His salvation, both the law and the angels are ruled out. In the eyes of God, the ordinances, rituals, and ceremonies of the law have been crucified on the cross. However, not many Christians realize this. Not only were sin, the natural man, the world, and Satan crucified on the cross; the law was also crucified there. For this reason, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92614" data-verses="Colossians 2:14">2:14</span> Paul says that God wiped out the handwriting in ordinances by nailing it to the cross. Because Paul’s vision was so clear, his word was very definite. As evil men were putting Christ on the cross, God was nailing the law to the cross. Although the law had been given by God through angels, God Himself nailed it to the cross of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="c33eAwsfVfXraWL3f3puOBKwse6xS-tqYFcEXib3Lo6hB_NVq0ahbWwl2qspOIzbJ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92615" data-verses="Colossians 2:14">Verse 14</span> is a powerful weapon to counteract the teaching of the Seventh-Day Adventists about the observance of the Sabbath. Observing the Sabbath is one of the ordinances, or rituals, of the law that has been nailed to the cross. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92616" data-verses="Colossians 2:14">2:14</span>, the ordinances have been taken out of the way and nailed to the cross. Hence, the Seventh-Day Adventists need to see that the Sabbath-keeping ordinances have been wiped out. The very thing they treasure God has taken away. Actually, the ordinance of keeping the Sabbath was against us and contrary to us. Because God loves us, He has taken away this ordinance for our sake. Nevertheless, the Seventh-Day Adventists seek to restore the very thing God has removed. </p>
<p data-content-id="YHo9_4F4rbtTN6uJrNVKlcVHebZwatkIM1JeaWPCErK8lD8OYCz-gEq8DCxiWamqp"> Do not argue with Seventh-Day Adventists about which day, the seventh or the eighth, should be observed. Rather, point out that the keeping of the Sabbath is part of the handwriting in ordinances which has been taken away. We may use <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92617" data-verses="Colossians 2:14">2:14</span> boldly as a weapon to annihilate the ordinance concerning observing the Sabbath. In God’s economy of His <span class="pg" data-page-id="190" id="190">[190]</span> salvation, there is no room for the law. Just as sin has been crucified on the cross, so the law has been crucified also. Both have been nailed to the cross of Christ. God does not want either sin or the law to remain. What He desires is for us to exist together with the risen Christ. </p>

When Christ was crucified, the leading evil angels attempted to surround God when Christ was on the cross. But God used the cross to strip off these angels. This is Paul’s concept in these verses. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sr4B7OdLi_gaxbmxLXiEYa2SS3aIHpPLZGWdu23POQDxs7Xqf3z_YUMIa59gSQKwD"> In a very real sense, the cross of Christ is the center of the universe. After God created the heavens, the earth, and the billions of items in the universe, an archangel rebelled, and many angels followed him. This archangel became Satan, and his followers became the evil rulers, powers, and authorities in the heavenlies. Eventually, the man created by God fell and became sinful. The rebellion of the angels and the fall of man put God into a difficult situation. God’s way to deal with this difficulty is the cross. Firstly, God became a man, thereby putting humanity on Himself. Then Christ, God incarnate, went to the cross and was crucified. During the thirty-three and a half years of His earthly life, Christ walked from the manger to the cross. When He was crucified, many things took place. On the cross God judged sin and the sinful old man. Through the cross, our sinful nature was terminated. At the very time God was judging sin and sinful man, He also nailed the law to the cross. When God was nailing the law to the cross, the evil angels also were present and very active. But, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92618" data-verses="Colossians 2:15">verse 15</span>, God stripped them off through the cross. </p>

According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92630" data-verses="Colossians 2:14">2:14</span>, the handwriting in ordinances, which was against us and contrary to us, has been taken out of the way. For a certain period of time, the law was in the way. Although God made use of the law, it was rather difficult for Him to move on to carry out His economy with the law in the way. Hence, when Christ was crucified, God came in to take the law out of the way by nailing it to the cross. </p>

According to the Old Testament, the Sabbath was a token of God’s creation. After laboring for six days, God rested on the seventh day, which became the Sabbath. Hence, the seventh day became a testimony of the old creation. It testified that creation came from God’s hand. As part of the old creation, man is obligated to keep the seventh day. However, the new creation came into existence on the first day of the week, on the day the Lord Jesus was resurrected from among the dead. Through Christ’s resurrection, the new creation, including the church constituted of the regenerated believers in Christ, was produced. Therefore, as the seventh day was a token of the old creation, the eighth day, the first day of the week, is a token of the new <span class="pg" data-page-id="196" id="196">[196]</span> creation. For this reason, nowhere in the New Testament are we told that Christians met together to worship on the seventh day. But at least two verses indicate that the saints met on the first day of the week. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92631" data-verses="Acts 20:7">Acts 20:7</span> says that on “the first day of the week...the disciples came together to break bread.” This indicates that during the time of the Apostle Paul the saints gathered to remember the Lord on the first day of the week. This shows that this day is a memorial of God’s new creation. Because as believers we are in the new creation, we no longer are obligated to observe the seventh day. Instead, we come together on the first day of the week to remember the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="riqDpjchUDoSOoMli_WZl-Ii2rcFNcNu7gQhs2g1WdrF9hCb4rF0iMESoWGxdqC3t"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92632" data-verses="1Corinthians 16:2">1 Corinthians 16:2</span> Paul says, “Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him.” This verse also strongly confirms the fact that the early Christians met on the first day of the week, not on the seventh day. Because they came together on this day, that was the best time to gather together their offerings to the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="d9yHx1EHlCF0Nc2ISA4iR70qGYkB8vzQsAr0x-_n5uKwoGhkDJWrhSt-NWfOCM6YO"> Some Seventh-Day Adventists point out that it was Paul’s practice to go to the synagogue on the Sabbath day. Yes, this was Paul’s practice, but his purpose was not to keep the Sabbath or to worship God. It was to take advantage of the opportunity to preach the gospel to the Jews. </p>
<p data-content-id="piRKMgn5tqXQZ3-2TvISTCkGKuA07R5jTePG4ht9Tcd7P32I3OUf8n-_v44p36SzH"> Another indication of the importance of the first day of the week in the New Testament is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92633" data-verses="Revelation 1:10">Revelation 1:10</span>. Here the Apostle John tells us that he was “in spirit on the Lord’s day.” The Lord’s Day is the first day of the week, the day the Lord was resurrected. As we have pointed out, the early church met on this day. On the Lord’s Day, a testimony of God’s new creation, John was in spirit to see visions related to God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="vIx9uQjmeEwOiVEgDgH8y0xEZew03NyCYgINrThFa0OoCG1Z0wmuhOJ40BCNUJHpK"> Even the types in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92634" data-verses="Leviticus 23:1">Leviticus 23</span> show the importance of the first day of the week. The children of Israel were to bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest to the priest to be waved before the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92635" data-verses="Leviticus 23:10-11">vv. 10-11</span>). We are told specifically that “on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.” The “morrow after the sabbath” is, of course, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="197" id="197">[197]</span> eighth day, or, the first day of the week. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92636" data-verses="Leviticus 23:16">Leviticus 23:16</span> speaks of “the morrow after the seventh sabbath.” This day was the day of Pentecost, which was also on the first day of the week. These verses are a further indication of the place of the eighth day in God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="W0UKyOT0t1IBxSIccUYMsUMOnQLZ3d_JmT-k52DOjH1qiyrn6ODlKeTuGk-ooeEF4"> We have seen that in God’s economy the seventh day is a memorial of the old creation, whereas the eighth day is a memorial of the new creation. Because the Jews are still in God’s old creation, they continue to keep the seventh day. But because we, the church, are in the new creation and no longer in the old creation, we are not required to keep the seventh day. Instead, we gather together on the first day of the week, the day which marks a new beginning in resurrection. Hence, those believers in Christ who advocate the observance of a seventh-day Sabbath are short of the proper knowledge of the Bible. For believers in Christ, the memorial day should no longer be the Sabbath; it should be the first day of the week, the day the Lord Jesus was resurrected from among the dead. Through His resurrection on the first day of the week, we were regenerated (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92637" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>). Now we are no longer in the old creation, but in the new creation. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92638" data-verses="Colossians 2:16-17">2:16 and 17</span> Paul says, “Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.” The Greek words rendered “in eating and in drinking” may also be translated “in food and in drink.” Food and drink signify satisfaction and strengthening. The feasts denote the annual Jewish festivals, which signify joy and enjoyment, and the new moons signify a new beginning with light in darkness. Furthermore, the Sabbaths signify completion and rest. Feasts are yearly, new moons monthly, Sabbaths weekly, and eating and drinking daily. <span class="pg" data-page-id="198" id="198">[198]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="f5FHReDvsyzvBMFzyvsIslz0QPllMZqgmUB6rb4-E6X-5JRriI2ZE461KcHMoNa9f"> All these items of the ceremonial law are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, which are the things to come. The body in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92639" data-verses="Colossians 2:17">verse 17</span>, like a man’s physical body, is the substance. The rituals in the law are a shadow of the real things in the gospel, like the shadow of a man’s body. Christ is the reality of the gospel. All the good things in the gospel belong to Him. The book of Colossians unveils such an all-inclusive Christ as the focus of God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ij7bPPSnYgJ7k5YLk7p3WF7OGuk49iispqhi6sQh09yxxcsmTBisNQ0qrwyEIQciJ"> I was a Christian for years before I gained a proper understanding of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92640" data-verses="Colossians 2:16-17">2:16 and 17</span>. Paul’s concept is that the various aspects of the ceremonial law are a shadow of things to come, of the spiritual things in Christ, just as a shadow is a figure of a person’s body. The festivals, the new moons, the Sabbaths, and the regulations concerning eating and drinking all were shadows. The body, the solid substance, of the shadows is Christ. </p>

For example, the food we eat is a shadow, not the real food. The real food is Christ. Christ is also the real drink. The clothing we wear to cover us, to beautify us, and to keep us warm is also a shadow of Christ. Christ is the One who truly covers our nakedness, who keeps us warm, and who imparts beauty to us. Christ is also our true dwelling place and real rest. The houses in which we live are a shadow of Christ as our dwelling place. The rest we enjoy at night is also a figure of Christ as our rest. Even the satisfaction we enjoy after a good meal is not the real satisfaction but a shadow of Christ as the reality of satisfaction. </p>

But starting from the middle of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92653" data-verses="Colossians 2:1">chapter two</span>, he begins to write from the direction of our practical daily life. In turning from the universal perspective to the practical perspective, he enables us to see the economy of God’s salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="3UjYSiEHFuVk3dorn6OJHP8S3-NjCsTE1JDXU4fE-zxmVMphWG74zhUcdZ0bQV1Uw"> In His salvation God has no intention to preserve the law; neither does He intend for angels to occupy a prominent position. In the economy of God’s salvation, both the law and the angels must be taken out of the way. In the salvation of His people, God does not want to use any indirect means. Instead, He desires to have direct contact with His chosen ones. The fact that God has wiped out the law and stripped off the rulers and authorities means that the way is now clear for God to contact His people directly without interference of any kind of mediation. </p>
<p data-content-id="GpAIfwI6Fm0o_bJAzhxAk04CTrNsvXPbvl-wOzBXDm09fW-1mBX4cRfsZbOTdf_Bp"> All the positive things that remain after the law and the angels have been taken out of the way are shadows of Christ. The heavens, the sun, the moon, the stars, food, and drink are all shadows, figures, of Christ, who is the body, the substance, of the shadows. All that we need for our physical living daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly is a shadow. Only Christ is the reality, the body. It is a serious mistake for believers to go back to the observances of the law. Furthermore, the worship of angels is a great insult to God. In like manner, we insult Him if we respect physical or material things more than Christ, for all such things are shadows of <span class="pg" data-page-id="204" id="204">[204]</span> Christ. To repeat, the law has been taken away, the angels have been stripped off, and the material things are shadows. Therefore, we have the ground to say that Christ is all in all. He is our law, ordinance, observance, angel, universe, sun, moon, star, heaven, earth, food, and drink. He is the reality of all positive matters in our daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly living. </p>
<p data-content-id="c33eAwsfVfXraWL3f3puOBKwsfaxbtNqYFcEXib3Lo6hB_NVq0ahbWwl2qspOIzbJ"> Writing from a universal direction, Paul shows that Christ is the portion of the saints, the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, the Head of the Body, the firstborn from among the dead, the One in whom the fullness of God dwells, the mystery of God’s economy, the indwelling hope of glory, the mystery of God, and the One in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden. As such a One, Christ is profound, preeminent, all-inclusive, and universal. Nevertheless, He dwells in us to be our hope of glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92654" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">1:27</span>). Turning from the universal perspective to the perspective of our daily life, Paul shows us that Christ is the reality of all the positive things for our daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly life. Therefore, Christ is not only all-inclusive universally; He is also detailed practically. </p>
<p data-content-id="YHo9_4F4rbtTN6uJrNVKlcVHea5wS-UIM1JeaWPCErK8lD8OYCz-gEq8DCxiWamqp"> The turn from the universal perspective to the practical perspective is made in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92655" data-verses="Colossians 2:14-15">2:14-15</span>. In these verses Paul makes it emphatically clear that in God’s salvation God has no intention to have anything between Him and His chosen people. In order to clear the way to enliven His chosen ones, He nailed the law to the cross and stripped off the angels. Although God used the law temporarily and although He ordained angels for His government, He will not allow either the law or the angels to stand in the way of His salvation. Now that the law and the angels have been taken out of the way, God has a clear atmosphere and an unhindered environment to contact the ones He has chosen and enliven them. He not only redeems His chosen ones, but also seeks to enliven them.

In just two verses he deals with eating and drinking, Sabbaths, new moons, and festivals. He points out that these things are shadows, whereas Christ is the body, the reality, the substance. This means that if we do not have Christ, we do not have reality; we have only shadows. Christ is the reality, the body of all positive things. Hence, in God’s economy there are no physical things or material things—there is only Christ. Moreover, Christ is not only the image of God, the firstborn of all creation, the firstborn from among the dead, the embodiment of the fullness of God, the mystery both of God’s economy and of God Himself; He is even the law, the angels, the food, the drink, the new moon, the Sabbath, and the feasts. Based upon such a revelation, we have the boldness and the assurance to declare that Christ is all in all. This is not our teaching; it is simply a recognition of what Paul says in Colossians. What a mercy that we in the Lord’s recovery can see Christ in all these aspects! With <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92656" data-verses="Colossians 1:1-2">Colossians 1 and 2</span> as our basis, we have the confidence to say that, as the One who is all in all, our Christ is the reality of every positive thing in the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="ggDaF55GyBbxJPqPBphLCbZaZPRKd0QCTqIDR3goq-SVfvSN8prg0TR811vkyUmRZ"> It was crucial for the believers in Colosse to realize this. There was no need for them to accept religious ordinances or the highest products of culture, including mysticism, philosophy, and asceticism. At Corinth there was the problem of fornication, but in Colosse the saints were practicing asceticism in order to restrict the lustful flesh. The Colossians had not seen the vision that Christ is everything. Otherwise, they would not have allowed culture to pervade the church and to defraud them of Christ. </p>

LETTING NO ONE DEFRAUD US</h2><p data-content-id="5znjdl0RibbATJcKH_ecb09_gcRFvEAnNfuxNd8ItWQaf-xO-QYNQQKXpfnLolJRo"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92657" data-verses="Colossians 2:18">2:18</span> Paul issues a warning to the believers at Colosse: “Let no one purposely defraud you of your prize, in humility <span class="pg" data-page-id="206" id="206">[206]</span> and worship of the angels, standing on things which he has seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh.” The Greek word rendered “purposely defraud” is difficult to translate. It may also be rendered “judge you unworthy.” It means to judge or criticize in such a way as to deceive. The heretical teachers judged that the saints were not worthy to worship God directly and told them that they had to worship God through the mediation of angels. This was to defraud the saints of their prize, which is Christ. In Christ, our sole Mediator, we can worship God directly. </p>
<p data-content-id="NvL9nhfr9y1MfkuCnJjWc5-mBngZRIH-02hvDSNt9dQdENu8DeMorULDAd59B1LCF"> The Greek expression for “purposely defraud” points to someone who contacts another with the fixed and determined intention of capturing him. It indicates someone who approaches another with the purpose of catching him and of making a prey of him. Even Christians can be used by the enemy to defraud in this way. They may contact others purposely with the intention to capture them. </p>
<p data-content-id="t5iqp8-G4gD5mGLTCIR_DHqa4TMd6sluKEbpWrQpW1yZ_muRMBVOIaTGcMROMFrnI"> In Colosse certain ones came to the saints, judging them and criticizing them with respect to particular practices. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92658" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">verse 16</span> indicates, they judged the believers regarding eating and drinking, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92659" data-verses="Colossians 2:18">Verse 18</span> continues the concept expressed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92660" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">verse 16</span>. Here Paul tells us that we should not allow anyone to judge us with the intention of defrauding us. All those who seek to defraud you come firstly with a critical spirit to point out things they feel are wrong or mistaken. They may criticize the church or the ministry. They may speak critically of the meetings or of your participation in the church life. The intention of such criticism is to deceive you and then to defraud you by snatching you away from Christ and the church. The meaning of defraud here is to defraud by judging and criticizing. The intention is to deprive you of your prize, which is the enjoyment of Christ and of the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="h3ZNAj-7-mNpWfPCijhB17Zq_NLLJSqT5I-hwnsewSx8Ec6pwTMhh2r5WyeY8HZbS"> If you check with those who have left the church life, you will find that they have been deprived of the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ and also of the enjoyment of the church life. Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, <span class="pg" data-page-id="207" id="207">[207]</span> are our enjoyment, our prize. To be deprived of Christ and the church is to be defrauded of our prize. </p>

<p data-content-id="NvL9nhfr9y1MfkuCnJjWc5-mBnQZWbn-02hvDSNt9dQdENu8DeMorULDAd59B1LCF"> In His economy God gives us one Person and one way. The one Person is the preeminent, all-inclusive Christ, and the one way is the cross. As the all-inclusive One, Christ is everything to us. He is God, man, and the reality of every positive thing in the universe. God has given us this marvelous Person to be our salvation. The one Person, Christ, is the center of the universe; and the one way, the cross, is the center of God’s government. God governs everything by the cross and deals with everything by the cross. Therefore, just as Christ is the focal point of the universe, so the cross is the center of God’s government. </p>
<p data-content-id="t5iqp8-G4gD5mGLTCIR_DHqa4T8d8_VuKEbpWrQpW1yZ_muRMBVOIaTGcMROMFrnI"> In this book Paul points out to the Colossians that nothing should become a substitute for Christ. Christ should not be replaced by ordinances, observances, mysticism, or philosophy. Christ is everything and must not be replaced by anything. In the previous message we covered the matter of Christ versus mysticism. In Colossians mysticism includes Gnosticism and asceticism. Christ is versus all manner of isms. He is versus every kind of replacement and substitute. </p>
<p data-content-id="h3ZNAj-7-mNpWfPCijhB17Zq_N7LABqT5I-hwnsewSx8Ec6pwTMhh2r5WyeY8HZbS"> We have pointed out that all the positive things in the universe are shadows of Christ. For example, our houses are a shadow of Christ as the real dwelling place. Since Christ is the substance of all the shadows, we should not allow the shadows to be a substitute for the One who is the body, the reality. How foolish to take shadows in place of the reality! The book of Colossians makes it clear that the all-inclusive <span class="pg" data-page-id="212" id="212">[212]</span> Christ is everything to us. God’s intention is not to give us thousands of items; it is simply to give us one Person, the all-inclusive Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="U-smkr1a6dFJm6oEW-7auOkFk_HXWaVwUVyMfwU3YgBr5P5j6Up1AlI-ogYff8uiJ"> Midway through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92668" data-verses="Colossians 2:1">chapter two</span>, Paul begins to show us that the cross is God’s unique way. God’s way is not asceticism. It is not to humble ourselves, to abase ourselves, or to treat ourselves severely. The one way is the way of the cross. By the cross God has dealt with all the negative things in the universe. Furthermore, God is still governing everything through the cross. Therefore, we have one Person and one way; that is, we have Christ and the cross. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XqFwK4-uCOxRvgyEbG31TFRJdBngOx1v26KaLLx9rvafbSffqSmEd1W12EaU8vYF3">NO PLACE FOR ASCETICISM</h2><p data-content-id="kX1nUfZuqQkzrLrgt3NFkih8lBRwQ3eJ9RDPm9pQmA9VJDK3iAAZbqak9qWDfH_Sw"> In this message we shall go on to see that the experience of Christ’s death is versus asceticism. In the Christian life there is no place for asceticism, no place for treating the body severely in the attempt to restrict the indulgence of the flesh. Asceticism is not God’s way. On the contrary, it is a human invention, a product of man’s fallen mind. Hindus and Buddhists may practice asceticism, but Christians should not. </p>
<p data-content-id="J_nFMNQorB6p2GT8JBzVIJEJjgNRIZNHJ9mfOn7jgTGQpHDcX8vywWDQZdhqUypmp"> Asceticism is part of the “elements of the world” spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92669" data-verses="Colossians 2:20">2:20</span>. These elements are the elementary principles of outward, material things, the childish teachings of externalism. These elements denote the rudimentary teachings of both Jews and Gentiles, teachings that consist of asceticism and of ritualistic observances in meats, drink, and washings. It is an elementary principle of asceticism to mistreat the body or to treat ourselves severely in an effort to suppress the flesh. God’s way, the way of the cross, is altogether different. </p>
<p data-content-id="zxxKVZo0L_3UdrO9iX46Tdlv3mFHq_fB11uoqtjPBjhY_rEsDeSQDqGrA0qATN0ay"> According to the economy of God’s salvation, the cross is God’s central way in the universe. However, most Christians see little of the cross in relation to the spiritual world. For the most part, Christians appreciate the physical aspect of the cross, the aspect that can be observed with human eyes. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92670" data-verses="Colossians 2:14-15">verses 14 and 15</span> there is a window through which we can see into the spiritual side of the cross of Christ. When Christ was on the cross, He was not only suffering; He <span class="pg" data-page-id="213" id="213">[213]</span> was working to accomplish redemption by bearing our sins and by doing the Father’s will. God was also working, wiping out the handwriting in ordinances by nailing it to the cross. As we have pointed out, the evil angelic rulers and authorities were busy also, having come to interfere with what God and Christ were doing. But God stripped them off, triumphed over them in the cross, and put them to an open shame. Of course, on the physical side, the Roman soldiers and the Jewish religionists were also very active. Because all this activity was brought to a focus on the cross, the cross became God’s eternal, central, and unique way. </p>
<p data-content-id="aw_owglmYsbhVQpnqDeZZJvwQglpyJPcebdjcPDhLYFI9FSkEF8RpLBEHkqv-h5U3"> I wish to emphasize the fact that God’s way is not asceticism. No Christian should practice asceticism. As believers in Christ, we are not a joyless people. On the contrary, we are a joyful people, those who constantly rejoice in the Lord. Why then should we inflict pain on our bodies or mistreat ourselves? How foolish! Our way, the unique way, is the cross. Therefore, the experience of the cross is versus asceticism. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bII_pa96wW65xpS_TOga8Qb0u1Gg1cUpsR-fiE2GZ2XncQE7FKuNnsp2sqi-cXeIt">HAVING DIED WITH CHRIST<br/>FROM THE ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD</h2><p data-content-id="qcLWvpSjI1XL62hLozF8aNmkcfsb7AaDsla5rdBghIZYVZKEAFjA56Gig5TWSCGAX"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92671" data-verses="Colossians 2:20">2:20</span> Paul points out that we have died with Christ from the elements of the world. These elements include Jewish observances, heathen ordinances, and philosophy. They also include mysticism and asceticism. The elements of the world are the elementary principles of worldly society, the rudimentary principles invented by mankind and practiced in society. With Christ we have died to these elements of the world. When Christ was crucified, we were crucified also. In His crucifixion we were released from the elementary principles of the world. </p>
<p data-content-id="yrS9bX0cFSGgVgun4Ufhw1Icmcrv8jeF1ONqnoyndBoPJWI5e-rH93nABe6-78JSB"> Since we have died with Christ from the elements of the world, Paul asks us why as living in the world we subject ourselves to ordinances. In a rebuking tone, Paul asked the believers in Colosse why they continued to subject themselves to ordinances, referring to the very elementary principles from which they had died in Christ. The world in <span class="pg" data-page-id="214" id="214">[214]</span> this verse refers not to the physical earth, but to human society, to mankind. Therefore, Paul was asking the believers why they still subjected themselves to ordinances as if they were still living in human society. </p>
<p data-content-id="8W3SYV3ote4j4Rg0nTLNGDsaeXLYGlmEc9qelKbjNksm4WKd2cErScxTa7rBwQTLq"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92672" data-verses="Colossians 2:21">verse 21</span> Paul lists some of these ordinances: “Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch.” These are rules and regulations in material things. These rules refer respectively to things that move, to things that are edible, and to things that are tangible. Handling, tasting, and touching include virtually every kind of action. Because these regulations are related to the practice of asceticism, to submit to ordinances concerning handling, tasting, and touching is to practice asceticism. </p>
<p data-content-id="0dvJwNTlnFFL7ZQjBM_mXPhF_iLx0RI_QdjxYstvjmR9qWy9nTfOsrOtXWOoopoj0"> Many years ago I met a brother who had been an orthodox Jew before becoming a Christian. In our fellowship together, he related many stories about various Jewish practices. He told me that some orthodox Jews place their shoes in a certain direction when they retire for the night, a practice supposedly based on a verse in the Old Testament. They believe that if they do not place their shoes in the proper direction, they will lose God’s blessing. What superstition! I am amazed that the Jews, an intelligent people who value education, could be so superstitious. Those who do not have Christ and the cross are often superstitious and also given to the practice of asceticism. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7cuojx9EnikxgkGvSa0_PvMZMkh3fNk5yo0N_UaqITA8UbezEJgBcuGWFgD9_1aau">PASSING THROUGH THE CROSS</h2><p data-content-id="_0z4CjgcRAzGySPl6nQ9kckrR98iL1lLuxfmejJOVBUIS_-qK7UtCn7ND1Qwyrk2f"> As those who have the one Person and the one way, we do not need regulations about where to place our shoes. When we go to bed at night, however, we should pass through the cross. This means that no matter what we have done during the day or what has happened to us, the cross takes care of everything. Suppose in the afternoon you are made unhappy in some way by your wife or husband. At bedtime you need to apply the cross to your feeling of unhappiness. If you do this, the feeling of unhappiness will disappear. This indicates that our way is the cross, not asceticism or any severe treatment of the self. Realizing that we have already died in <span class="pg" data-page-id="215" id="215">[215]</span> Christ, we should go to bed at night with a consciousness of the cross. If we practice going to bed through the cross, lying down with the realization that we have died in Christ, the next morning we shall wake up in resurrection as a new person. We not only have Christ, the unique Person who is versus all things; we also have the cross, the unique way, which is versus all other ways. </p>
<p data-content-id="BOCvS1r-7tIB54EhOvqqTqjp1rUq5aJvx43xAqzzl996JaIsWLw395nl-aNWe_mB3"> Because we have Christ and the cross, there is no place for self-imposed humility. There is no need for us to train ourselves to be humble. I have observed, both in the Orient and in the West, that the most proud people are those who have learned to practice a form of humility. We need not learn such practices. Rather, we should simply take the unique way of the cross. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Twq0tWAMk6bVuZEt9Z9lD5HOFQYTW_odL3jAfCQiy5hBnTJuAz_YAL8NdDTj2RtGV">THE PROCESSED GOD</h2><p data-content-id="nAAjrYoSxORsKcXED0Y92nk_kP28YQbYu242cBU-V2b50Voz0s71JJrl7esVgPqMx"> In eternity past God existed alone. Then, in time, He created all things. At a certain point in history, this creating God, the Creator of all, became a man. This crucial step is called incarnation. By means of incarnation, God put on man with all of creation, for man is the head of creation. The Lord Jesus, God incarnate, lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years. When He was crucified, all creation was crucified with Him. This means that not only did Christ go to the cross, but the very man God had put on Himself with the entire creation went to the cross with Him. Therefore, Christ’s death on the cross was an all-inclusive crucifixion. After His crucifixion, Christ was buried in a tomb. The man and the creation which were crucified with Christ were also buried in that tomb. After three days, Christ arose from the dead in His resurrection. Through resurrection and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. Furthermore, in His ascension to the third heaven, He was crowned and became the Head and the Lord over all. Then He descended upon His Body as the all-inclusive Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="6lc_KG4lpSEXBWvOfF9n73K2FT9BoPqSbKVHRXhoCGalmrzef-H9gsKXflDUdQgSY"> Because God, after completing the work of creation, passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension, we may speak of Him as the processed God. The diagram portrays the process <span class="pg" data-page-id="220" id="220">[220]</span> through which He has passed. Through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, He has become the life-giving Spirit. After ascending to the third heaven, where He was enthroned and crowned, and where He was made the Head and Lord of all, He descended upon the church, His Body. In His descension, He is the all-inclusive Spirit. This all-inclusive Spirit has come upon God’s elect, who make up the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="RfNO2lIzA5Rw54npqQTHNA_TIjc6W9wgvd8yXLZ0NJhLX6FOEZQflozxR78uf33Oy"> When Christ was incarnated and born in the manger in Bethlehem, He put humanity on Himself. This humanity included us and all of creation as well. Hence, even before we were born, Christ put us on Himself. As Christ passed through human living, we passed through it with Him. Furthermore, when He went to the cross and was crucified, we were crucified with Him. Then we were buried with Him in the tomb. In fact, all of creation was buried there. Thus, Christ’s tomb was an all-inclusive tomb. We have also resurrected and ascended with Christ. Now, even while we are participating in the church life, we are sitting with Him in the heavenlies. On the one hand, we are in the church on earth; on the other hand, we are in Christ in the heavenlies. There is a great deal of traffic between the heavens and the church, traffic that moves faster than the speed of light. Actually, to refer to such traffic is to speak from a human point of view. From God’s point of view, the heavens and the church are one. Therefore, to be in the church is to be in the heavens. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MbvcrlXtA4GGPOZNOvDot4_k5KUO4_YWsRhB1iUfY2NjrQ3EE-RVlAKh7NIKw-9kI">THE REALITY OF THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</h2><p data-content-id="Vehc_DxwcgXUMWVvg6ZqRxQAf8GkSIcmilbKcMYbZp13kc_c_BsTJjIrnVSGak81f"> We also need to point out that the all-inclusive Spirit is the reality of the compound ointment described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92688" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>. As the compound ointment, the Spirit no longer includes only the Spirit of God typified by the olive oil, but also the aspects of Christ’s death and resurrection typified by the spices. After the olive oil had been blended with the spices, the oil became a compound, an ointment. Formerly the olive oil was of one essence, one element. But after it had been compounded with the spices, other elements had <span class="pg" data-page-id="221" id="221">[221]</span> been added to it. The ointment produced by compounding olive oil with the four spices signifies the all-inclusive Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="iiCXRFpuXcPrT8Ib2ei9Wmk1Fl5yhf2ws6tpqdIZHirz4qBni4rQoR_fScofdndKl"> In eternity past the Spirit of God existed with just one element, the element of divinity. But at the time of Christ’s incarnation, God put on humanity. During Christ’s thirty-three and a half years of human living on earth, more was added to the divine element. Furthermore, through His crucifixion, the essence of His all-inclusive, effective death was added to Him. The same was true of His resurrection. As Christ took these crucial steps, God was processed and compounded with humanity. Just as the olive oil was blended with the spices to be a type, the Spirit of God was blended with the effectiveness and sweetness of Christ’s death and with the effectiveness and power of His resurrection. Therefore, our God is now the processed God who descends as the all-inclusive Spirit upon His chosen people and enters into them to make them the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1aJmujdY8zf3BLa1Nx2x7qmP29iUNhu3l_vTi90iiOmndjKLwrW8aLxpNk6UPXsej">THE TWO BIRTHS OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="9CMGouSfiMWAlo_AF78CKdna-2381reYi6ay6JvhbqmWxQR8qwvMZ9jTvWt74Euid"> According to the New Testament, Christ has had two births. His first birth took place at His incarnation, and His second birth was in His resurrection. The church came into being through the resurrection of Christ. In His second birth the firstborn Son of God was born with all His brothers, who are the members of His Body, the church. Therefore, the church was born in resurrection, that is, in the second birth of Christ. The church now continues its existence in the all-inclusive Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jSqu1fKMETv3AEO0jRP6XSxNEbx2bzZ3Bj8ZR-J9t-t3Qs846TNRWzfLsChMbFjod">ONE PERSON AND ONE WAY</h2><p data-content-id="Twq0tWAMk6bVuZEt9Z9lD5HOFQYTRsodL3jAfCQiy5hBnTJuAz_YAL8NdDTj2RtGV"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that in God’s economy there is one Person, Christ, and one way, the cross. The diagram is actually a chart of this one Person and the one way. Things such as Gnosticism and asceticism have no place here. The teachings of Plato, Socrates, and Confucius and the practices of asceticism are all outside of Christ and apart from the way of the cross. All religions, including Judaism and Christianity, are outside of the line depicted on <span class="pg" data-page-id="222" id="222">[222]</span> the diagram. But in the Lord’s recovery we are being brought back to the one Person and the one way. We all need to be recovered from so many different kinds of isms, philosophies, and practices to this one line, to Christ and the cross. Today both Christ and the cross are in the all-inclusive Spirit. Therefore, to be recovered to Christ and the cross is to be recovered to the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="nAAjrYoSxORsKcXED0Y92nk_kP28eDLYu242cBU-V2b50Voz0s71JJrl7esVgPqMx"> In our daily Christian experience we need to know the difference between practicing asceticism and taking the way of the cross. To take the cross is certainly not to cause ourselves to suffer in some way. Some saints may say that to experience the cross is to exercise faith in order to apply what Christ accomplished on Calvary to our situation. But even this may be a subtle form of asceticism. In my early years as a Christian, I appreciated the book, <em>The Imitation of Christ.</em> Eventually I learned that a great deal of what that book advocates is actually asceticism. </p>

The effectiveness of the death of Christ is in this Spirit, just as the effectiveness of certain medicines is included in a certain prescribed dose. When a person takes the prescribed dose, he experiences the effectiveness of that medicine. Today the all-inclusive Spirit is an all-inclusive dose. This dose includes the effectiveness of Christ’s death and the power of His resurrection. Furthermore, Christ’s resurrected and uplifted humanity is also in the all-inclusive Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="sQ-jiCKNjXFon2Sit_5DdVXU6cSLR6KUaRJLlAaDAC4Gkuj3zqfMcEH9tudAOZTWi"> According to the New Testament, the all-inclusive Spirit is <em>the</em> Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92689" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span> we are told that the Spirit was not yet because Jesus was not yet glorified. This means the Spirit of God had not yet been compounded to become <em>the</em> Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit. But when Jesus was glorified, the process of compounding was accomplished, and <em>the</em> Spirit came into being. Today it is <em>the</em> Spirit who descends upon us and enters into us to indwell our spirit. In this Spirit we have the effectiveness of the death of Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="223" id="223">[223]</span> </p>

Then the Spirit will spontaneously apply the effectiveness of the death of Christ to us. This is what it means to apply the death of Christ. Furthermore, when we open to the Spirit and allow Him to apply the death of Christ to our situation, this experience of Christ’s death will bring Christ to us in resurrection. Hence, through the experience of Christ’s death, we also experience His resurrection. The more we experience this, the more we can say with Paul, “To me to live is Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92690" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Phil. 1:21</span>). </p>

Hence, our members, which are sinful, are identified with sinful things, such as fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and unbridled greedy lust. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92723" data-verses="Colossians 3:6">3:6</span> Paul points out that because of these things “the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92724" data-verses="Colossians 3:7">verse 7</span> he goes on to say that the believers once walked in these things when they lived in them. </p>
<p data-content-id="-8P5_We9HlrZyO3mbt2-Dnw29FRjvlJMPtZfEzTH8mFI2NJZdM2qdWpYHt1XsAb0_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92725" data-verses="Colossians 3:5">verse 5</span> Paul charges us to put to death our members which are on the earth. This charge is based upon the fact that we have been crucified with Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92726" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20a</span>) and <span class="pg" data-page-id="230" id="230">[230]</span> that we have been baptized into His death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92727" data-verses="Romans 6:3">Rom. 6:3</span>). We execute Christ’s death upon our sinful members by crucifying them, by faith, through the power of the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92728" data-verses="Romans 8:13">Rom. 8:13</span>). This corresponds to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92729" data-verses="Galatians 5:24">Galatians 5:24</span>. Christ has accomplished the all-inclusive crucifixion.

All those who believe in the Lord Jesus should be baptized. In baptism we not only recognize Christ’s death, but we also apply it to ourselves. Therefore, in baptism we are placed into the death of Christ and buried. </p>
<p data-content-id="0dvJwNTlnFFL7ZQjBM_mXPhF_hrx0TI_QdjxYstvjmR9qWy9nTfOsrOtXWOoopoj0"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92730" data-verses="Romans 8:11">Romans 8:11</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92731" data-verses="Romans 8:13">13</span>, the putting to death of the practices of the body is an action carried out in the power of the Spirit. It is not accomplished by self-effort. Our attempts to put to death the practices of the body are nothing more than asceticism. Although we are not to practice asceticism, we are to put to death the negative things in us by the power of the Holy Spirit. In order to do this, we need to open to the Spirit and allow the Spirit to flow within us. Through the Spirit’s flowing, we shall experience the effectiveness of Christ’s death. This is not asceticism; it is the operation of the Spirit within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="7cuojx9EnikxgkGvSa0_PvMZMnB3cNE5yo0N_UaqITA8UbezEJgBcuGWFgD9_1aau"> A number of saints have read the autobiography of Madame Guyon. This book contains definite traces of asceticism and mysticism, the very things that damaged the church in Colosse. Those who read books written by the mystics must do so with discernment. Although some things in these books are helpful, others are poisonous. Many years ago, we were helped by some of these books. However, we eventually learned that reading such books without discernment can lead seeking Christians into the error of asceticism. Therefore I do not recommend that you read these books without the help of some saints who are more experienced. Even recently, some, especially sisters, have been damaged by them. </p>
<p data-content-id="_0z4CjgcRAzGySPl6nQ9kckrR-ciI1FLuxfmejJOVBUIS_-qK7UtCn7ND1Qwyrk2f"> We need to be warned concerning asceticism. We should not impose anything on ourselves in an attempt to deal with <span class="pg" data-page-id="231" id="231">[231]</span> the lust of the flesh. On the contrary, our practice should be to open ourselves in fellowship with the Lord and allow the Spirit to have a free way to flow within us, and to apply the effectiveness of Christ’s all-inclusive death to the negative things in our being. Asceticism is spiritual suicide; in contrast, what we are speaking of is the application of Christ’s death through the flowing of the Spirit. </p>

All negative things, whether of the flesh or of the fallen soul, must be put aside. We do this, not by our own energy, but by the power of the all-inclusive Spirit. </p>

The total person of the old man must be put away. In this verse Paul speaks of “having put off the old man” because we put off the old man in baptism. Our old man was crucified with Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92734" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Rom. 6:6</span>) and was buried in baptism (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92735" data-verses="Romans 6:4">Rom. 6:4</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="QoYPkMNcmTS0w0HcQG2WFMBh6gpNjcno00ymhHKS1B0KuZrfvJx-ndqeKB8A9ADgi">IV. HAVING PUT ON THE NEW MAN</h2><p data-content-id="KavjviC-d0XiSiopL73LYAPbuy-Jc9ycsRXMlBkeWvyXWct-X5tTcxic3H8-f0epm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92736" data-verses="Colossians 3:10">verse 10</span> Paul declares, “And having put on the new man, who is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him.” To put on the new man is like putting on a new garment. The Greek word for new in this verse means young, new in time. This is different from <span class="pg" data-page-id="232" id="232">[232]</span> the word used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92737" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">Ephesians 4:24</span>, which means new in nature, quality, or form. </p>
<p data-content-id="lGebDchapj8MhaQa-6qJi3EWlwf6ACIIEBHfdfUryVbKKL4PAwixxjPTbBKYDu4Le"> The new man is of Christ. It is His Body, created in Him on the cross (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92738" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15-16">Eph. 2:15-16</span>). It is not individual, but corporate. According to the clear vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92739" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span>, the new man is a corporate entity. This is proved by the fact that it is created out of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92740" data-verses="Ephesians 2:16">Ephesians 2:16</span> indicates that the new man created out of these collective peoples is the Body of Christ. Hence, the new man and the Body are synonymous terms and may be used interchangeably. </p>
<p data-content-id="OLv1qDRjKPpb7WeQhnpjddP7kRLMVtJE-1ppPPLq1fp8MR8MpzzfwWWMlwmSEija5"> The fact that the new man is the Body and that the Body is the new man is a strong indication that the new man is not an individual entity, but a corporate entity. Therefore, it is a serious mistake for some versions of the Bible to speak of putting on the new self. The New American Standard Version makes this very error in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92741" data-verses="Colossians 3:10">Colossians 3:10</span> by adopting the rendering, “have put on the new self.” This is a very serious error. It goes beyond interpreting the Bible to actually changing it. The Greek word means man, not self. Thus, it is altogether wrong to talk about putting on the new self. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92742" data-verses="Colossians 3:10">Colossians 3:10</span>, what we have put on is the new man, not the new self. </p>

In this section of Colossians, Christ is revealed in a full way. Here Paul does not say that Christ is the Lamb of God, the manna, or the living water. Rather, he tells us that Christ is the portion of the saints, the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, the firstborn from among the dead, the mystery of God’s economy, the indwelling hope of glory, the mystery of God, and the One in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden. As we consider all these aspects of Christ, we shall realize that the revelation of Christ conveyed in Colossians is extraordinary, absolutely different from what is revealed elsewhere in the Scriptures. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ij7bPPSnYgJ7k5YLk7p3WF7OGt046xispqhi6sQh09yxxcsmTBisNQ0qrwyEIQciJ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92770" data-verses="Colossians 3:12">3:12—4:6</span> Paul turns to the matter of the living of the saints in union with Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92771" data-verses="Colossians 3:12-15">3:12-15</span> he speaks of the necessity of being ruled by the peace of Christ, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92772" data-verses="Colossians 3:16-17">verses 16 and 17</span>, of the word of Christ dwelling in us richly. To live in union with Christ means that in our living we are not apart from Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92773" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> the Lord tells us to abide in Him, for apart from Him we can do nothing. In the eyes of God, whatever we do apart from Christ has no value. Therefore, if we are separated from the all-inclusive Christ revealed in Colossians, we cannot do anything. The living of the saints must be in <span class="pg" data-page-id="240" id="240">[240]</span> union with Christ. This means that in our living we need to be one with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="HJXSCv7FjRX11Nlg8l5j7efQk5HgIfJ6T3GdC5v5dCb9ChbHCNsZDKBUk5DL1WVtx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92774" data-verses="Colossians 3:10-11">3:10 and 11</span> we see that in the new man Christ is all and in all. Christ is all the members and in all the members. In the new man there is no room for any natural person. Rather, Christ is everyone and is in everyone. To say that Christ is all and in all in the new man indicates that we are one with Christ and that Christ is one with us. We may even say that Christ is we and that we are He. This points to our union with Christ. Therefore, the living of the saints must be a living that is in union with Christ, a living that is identified with Him. If we live in such a way, we and Christ, Christ and we, are one. We live, and Christ lives in our living. </p>
<p data-content-id="XqFwK4-uCOxRvgyEbG31TFRJdCXgHjVv26KaLLx9rvafbSffqSmEd1W12EaU8vYF3"> We need to be one with the Lord Jesus just as He is one with the Father. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92775" data-verses="John 14:10">John 14:10</span> the Lord said, “The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works.” This indicates that the Father works in the Son’s speaking. Although the Father and the Son are two Persons, They have just one life and one living. The life of the Father is the life of the Son, and the living of the Son is the living of the Father. On the one hand, the Father’s life is the Son’s life. On the other hand, the Son’s living is the Father’s living. In this way the Father and the Son have one life and one living. The principle is the same with Christ and us. Today we and Christ have one life and one living. The Son’s life becomes our life, and our living becomes His living. This is what it means to live in union with Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="kX1nUfZuqQkzrLrgt3NFkih8lChwYluJ9RDPm9pQmA9VJDK3iAAZbqak9qWDfH_Sw"> In such a union we and Christ, Christ and we, are one. In a very practical sense, Christ is we and we are Christ, for we live as one. His life is our life, and our living is His living. Therefore, Christ lives in our living.

<p data-content-id="6lc_KG4lpSEXBWvOfF9n73K2FQdBhdKSbKVHRXhoCGalmrzef-H9gsKXflDUdQgSY"> Concerning our living in union with Christ, Paul tells us to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our hearts and to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. Paul does not speak of <span class="pg" data-page-id="241" id="241">[241]</span> these things elsewhere in his Epistles. Notice Paul’s use of the word “let” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92776" data-verses="Colossians 3:15-16">verses 15 and 16</span>. This word indicates that both the peace of Christ and the word of Christ are already present. However, we need to allow them to operate within us. We need to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in us, and we must let the word of Christ dwell in us. There is no problem with either the peace of Christ or with the word of Christ. The problem is with us, in particular with our allowing these things to work in us. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92779" data-verses="Colossians 3:12">verse 12</span> Paul says, “Put on therefore as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering; bearing one another and forgiving one another, if anyone should have a complaint against any; as the Lord forgave you, so also should you forgive.” Having put on the new man, we also need to put on the spiritual virtues listed in these verses. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92780" data-verses="Colossians 3:12">verse 12</span> Paul addresses the believers as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved. The new man is God’s elect, God’s chosen ones. Furthermore, the new man is holy. This means that the new man is neither common nor worldly; rather, he is separated to God. Moreover, the new man is beloved. According to this verse, the new man is chosen, holy, and beloved. </p>
<p data-content-id="wrbcmMjVyCQkgWdRivfLA0DYvvUML4ud3uqzGEffBGQc6UVl06Y-KY2UHVu1-W7x4"> As such a new man, we need to put on all the necessary spiritual virtues: a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, and longsuffering. Lowliness is somewhat different from humility. A person may be proud of his humility, but not of lowliness. The heretical teachers at Colosse taught a form of self-abasing humility. But Paul taught spiritual lowliness as well as meekness and longsuffering. </p>
<p data-content-id="LGGjP-PAOdJ8nFxUYQbpLuUq1CMMQvyhMQZw72ekAlg3c478l-zKR4IjWE4Bf53rA"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92781" data-verses="Colossians 3:13">verse 13</span> Paul goes on to speak of bearing one another and forgiving one another. The forgiving Lord is our life, and He lives within us. Forgiving is a virtue of His life. When we <span class="pg" data-page-id="242" id="242">[242]</span> take Him as our person and live by Him, forgiving others will be a spontaneous virtue of our Christian life. </p>

PUTTING ON LOVE, THE BOND OF PERFECTNESS</h2><p data-content-id="ZIaYAIUhlPYkrS-W4qNUAjewXfe-Me35Enf7GKa9aNGLCeSPPJyL_qRbhaKXPVpri"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92782" data-verses="Colossians 3:14">verse 14</span> Paul goes on to say, “And over all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness.” The Greek word rendered perfectness can also be translated completeness. God is love (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92783" data-verses="1John 4:16">1 John 4:16</span>). Love is the very essence of God’s being, the very substance of the divine life. Hence, to put on love is to be clothed with the element of God’s life. Such a love is the uniting bond in the combination of perfectness, completeness, and mature virtues. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="A9Ho75-1IEWiI5pZAWtoolFIAGKNq-gDjip1OYh6Z3Q5wGMSc15rgkFYdiHX9QQ7d">III. LETTING THE PEACE OF CHRIST<br/>ARBITRATE IN OUR HEARTS</h2><p data-content-id="F8T5SrvVvSK9adYDT1faMIT2sKUYTeOvvK68nXJGmPygBYfXAuqVH6_7nXxzbpNoL"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92784" data-verses="Colossians 3:15">verse 15</span> Paul says, “And let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts, to which also you were called in one Body; and be thankful.” The Greek term for arbitrate can also be rendered umpire, preside, or be enthroned as a ruler and decider of everything. The arbitrating peace of Christ in our hearts dissolves the complaint mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92785" data-verses="Colossians 3:13">verse 13</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="CV0IHBXEspCOWkPgBxpK-FPjuTK4Ks12YOitnjJYe71lPdJfo-RTTzkzgsHXnVKBu"> The relative pronoun “which” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92786" data-verses="Colossians 3:15">verse 15</span> refers to the peace of Christ. We were called to this peace in the one Body of Christ. For the proper Body life we need the peace of Christ to arbitrate, to adjust, to decide all things in our heart in the relationships between the members of His Body. Our having been called to the peace of Christ should also motivate us to let this peace arbitrate in our hearts. </p>
<p data-content-id="P48e1Zv0yLRjkEdD3vDxRlw0uzNxABysNs7_pSaWHLCXEoMkdyKlIfpN-GyxhQQiF"> In this verse Paul also encourages us to be thankful. We should not only let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our hearts, but we should also be thankful to the Lord. In the Body life our heart should always be in a peaceful condition toward the members and thankful to the Lord. </p>

This portion of Colossians contains matters that are crucial for our Christian life. We should not isolate this part of the book from the foregoing chapters and verses. On the contrary, we need to see that it is a continuation of all that Paul has covered. We have pointed out again and again that Colossians reveals who Christ is and what Christ is. Eventually, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92807" data-verses="Colossians 3:10-11">3:10 and 11</span>, we see that Christ is the new man. Because Christ is the new man, we and Christ are one. This is the basic and most crucial point in this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="8W3SYV3ote4j4Rg0nTLNGDsafWrYB1GEc9qelKbjNksm4WKd2cErScxTa7rBwQTLq"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92808" data-verses="Colossians 1:1">chapters one and two</span> Paul covers many aspects of Christ. Christ is the portion of the saints, the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of creation, the firstborn from among the dead, the One in whom the fullness of the Triune God dwells, the mystery of God’s economy, the mystery of God, the indwelling hope of glory, and the One in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92809" data-verses="Colossians 2:1">chapter two</span> Paul goes on to declare that Christ is the reality of all the shadows. Because such a Christ is all and in all in the new man, of which we are a part, Christ eventually becomes us. We and Christ are one. God’s ultimate goal in His economy is to gain this new man constituted of the preeminent, all-inclusive Christ wrought into a corporate people. We all need to have such a high view of God’s economy. According <span class="pg" data-page-id="250" id="250">[250]</span> to this view, we and Christ are one, for we and He have one life with one living. </p>
<p data-content-id="0dvJwNTlnFFL7ZQjBM_mXPhF-jrxyB4_QdjxYstvjmR9qWy9nTfOsrOtXWOoopoj0"> Paul’s intention in writing the book of Colossians was to impress all the believers with the fact that Christ is everything. The Jewish believers should forget their ordinances and observances, and the Gentile believers should lay aside their philosophical concepts. We were not regenerated for the sake of such observances and concepts. We were regenerated for Christ. Now we need to be filled with Christ, saturated with Christ, and permeated with Christ until Christ becomes us. </p>
<p data-content-id="7cuojx9EnikxgkGvSa0_PvMZNlB3VfE5yo0N_UaqITA8UbezEJgBcuGWFgD9_1aau"> We have pointed out that in God’s economy there is one Person, Christ, and one way, the cross. Through this one Person and one way, God will gain the new man. The new man is Christ constituted into us. On the one hand, the new man is Christ; on the other hand, we, the believers, are the new man. For this reason, in the new man, Christ and we are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="_0z4CjgcRAzGySPl6nQ9kckrQ8ciAnVLuxfmejJOVBUIS_-qK7UtCn7ND1Qwyrk2f"> As those who are part of the new man, we need to let the peace of Christ arbitrate within us and let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. If we do this, we shall spontaneously express Christ in our daily living. This means that we shall live out Christ, for we are one with Him, we have His peace, and we have His word. Therefore, we become the expression of Christ in a practical way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="QoYPkMNcmTS0w0HcQG2WFMBh7ipNjeno00ymhHKS1B0KuZrfvJx-ndqeKB8A9ADgi">I. EXPRESSING CHRIST IN HUMAN LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="KavjviC-d0XiSiopL73LYAPbvw-Jc_ycsRXMlBkeWvyXWct-X5tTcxic3H8-f0epm"> God desires that Christ be expressed through human life. We see this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92810" data-verses="Colossians 3:18">3:18—4:1</span>, a sister passage to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92811" data-verses="Ephesians 5:22">Ephesians 5:22—6:9</span>, regarding the believers’ ethical relationships. In Ephesians the emphasis is on the need of spirit-filled ethical relationships for the expression of the Body in the normal church life. In Colossians the emphasis is that we should hold Christ as our Head and take Him as our life by having His rich word dwelling in us, that the highest ethical relationships, issuing not from our natural life but from Christ as our life, may be realized for His expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="lGebDchapj8MhaQa-6qJi3EWkyf6DCoIEBHfdfUryVbKKL4PAwixxjPTbBKYDu4Le"> If we live in union with Christ, Christ will be expressed through our humanity. Christ is to be expressed in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="251" id="251">[251]</span> human life, not in the angelic life. Angels cannot express Christ. The Father has ordained that we, His chosen ones, be the expression of His Son. “Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,” should be our prayer (see <em>Hymns</em> #403). </p>
<p data-content-id="OLv1qDRjKPpb7WeQhnpjddP7lTLMWtpE-1ppPPLq1fp8MR8MpzzfwWWMlwmSEija5"> If we would be those through whom Christ can live, we need to pass through the first two and a half chapters of the book of Colossians. Then, coming to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92812" data-verses="Colossians 3:15-16">3:15 and 16</span>, we need to be those in whom the peace of Christ arbitrates and in whom the word of Christ dwells richly. Then Christ will be expressed in our human living. </p>
<p data-content-id="4IBzwnFeZUmiPTldQylpqjfn860uxIheAumWT0F5vBeYLZvZUxnAH8UtbPcg2OgXO"> Many of those in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Catholicism have a low estimate of human life. They do not care for marriage or for the proper family life. They prefer to remain unmarried, and they aspire to live a type of angelic life. But the angelic life cannot express Christ. On the contrary, Christ needs to be expressed in those who are husbands, wives, parents, children, masters, and slaves. In order to express Christ, we need to have a proper and normal human life. </p>
<p data-content-id="omf13Bx02SFTK6-4sHpHdKgU2aWji_SgyrvnjZRmemRqzlC_dbZvNK2s_tofFhghm"> As an elderly person with eight children and more than twenty grandchildren, I can testify that the Lord knows how to choose the best husband or wife for us and what kind of children we should have. He also knows how to break us and make us transparent so that we can express Christ. Through our family life we learn many valuable lessons from the Lord. I believe that the angels are observing to see whether or not we live out Christ in our family life. It is not as difficult to live out Christ in the church as it is to live Him out at home. But how wonderful it is for a brother or sister to express Christ in his or her married life! No brother or sister in the Lord’s recovery should aspire to live like a monk or nun. At the right time, the brothers and sisters should marry and then learn through the experiences of married life to express Christ in their human living. </p>
<p data-content-id="3UjYSiEHFuVk3dorn6OJHP8S2_djF_TE1JDXU4fE-zxmVMphWG74zhUcdZ0bQV1Uw"> The living of the saints in union with Christ should result in the expression of Christ in human life. If we see this, we shall praise the Lord for our human living. Furthermore, we shall have a fresh appreciation for married life. I can <span class="pg" data-page-id="252" id="252">[252]</span> testify that I am thankful for my wife, children, and grandchildren. I am grateful for all the lessons the Lord has taught me through them. The more I advance in years, the more I appreciate the lessons I have learned through the course of my human life. In the relationship between wife and husband and between children and parents we need to live out Christ and express Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="GpAIfwI6Fm0o_bJAzhxAk04CSqdspEfbvl-wOzBXDm09fW-1mBX4cRfsZbOTdf_Bp"> The principle is the same in the relationship between masters and servants. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92813" data-verses="Colossians 3:22-25">verses 22 through 25</span> Paul gives a charge to the slaves. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92814" data-verses="Colossians 3:24">verse 24</span> he speaks of receiving “the reward of the inheritance.” This point is not made as clear in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92815" data-verses="Ephesians 6:8">Ephesians 6:8</span> as it is here. There is an inheritance for the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92816" data-verses="Romans 8:17">Rom. 8:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92817" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92818" data-verses="1Peter 1:4">1 Pet. 1:4</span>). The reward of the inheritance indicates that the Lord uses the inheritance which He will give His believers as an incentive that they may be faithful in their service to Him. The unfaithful ones will surely miss this reward (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92819" data-verses="Matthew 24:45-51">Matt. 24:45-51</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92820" data-verses="Matthew 25:20-29">25:20-29</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="Ekj8KtyS_lkUZoS96keszutDh2I6B2wcNJn28_oNc3vFOaI1hUNqhE5B4RkV_HSQJ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92821" data-verses="Colossians 4:2-4">Colossians 4:2-4</span> Paul turns to the matter of prayer. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92822" data-verses="Colossians 4:2">verse 2</span> he says, “Persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving.” To persevere is to continue persistently, steadfastly, and earnestly. In prayer we need to be watchful and alert, not negligent. Such watchfulness should be accompanied by thanksgiving. </p>
<p data-content-id="DoDlSswZom_4i2OTnuzO3QHEH4MZ0S5-vevsKnj9CyhxI_r5snfUvFBDoS7HJ6EHS"> If we would express Christ in our human living and preserve the grace we have received from the Lord, we need to persevere in prayer. As we spend time to consider the revelation of the all-inclusive Christ in Colossians, we shall surely receive grace from the Lord. Eventually, we shall see that we and Christ are one, that His peace is arbitrating within us, and that His word is filling us. Then we shall be able to live Him out and express Him. However, no matter how much grace we receive from the Lord, it will leak away if we fail to persevere in prayer. Only prayer can maintain the grace we receive. Only through prayer can this grace <span class="pg" data-page-id="253" id="253">[253]</span> become prevailing and living in our experience. To be sure, the Christian life is a life of receiving grace. But this life needs to be sustained by prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sr4B7OdLi_gaxbmxLXiEYa2ST3qIErvLZGWdu23POQDxs7Xqf3z_YUMIa59gSQKwD"> The most important matter in the maintenance of our physical life is breathing. Breathing is even more important than eating and drinking. We can go for days without eating or drinking, but only a few minutes without breathing. Prayer is spiritual breathing. To pray is to breathe. </p>

<p data-content-id="lGebDchapj8MhaQa-6qJi3EWkyP6EQoIEBHfdfUryVbKKL4PAwixxjPTbBKYDu4Le"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92831" data-verses="Colossians 4:7-17">Verses 7 through 17</span> contain Paul’s fellowship, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92832" data-verses="Colossians 4:18">verse 18</span> contains his greeting. I have often wondered why such a large portion of this Epistle is given over to this concluding word. Why did Paul not use these verses to say something more concerning the all-inclusive Christ? Considering the revelation in this book as a whole, the space devoted to the conclusion seems out of proportion. After telling us that our speech should always be with grace, seasoned with salt, Paul could simply have concluded this Epistle with the words in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92833" data-verses="Colossians 4:18">verse 18</span>, thus eliminating all the details recorded in these verses. Paul, however, did not do this. Instead, before saying the final word, Paul tells the Colossians that Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister, would make known all that concerned Paul, that he had sent Tychicus together with Onesimus to them for this very thing; that Aristarchus, Paul’s fellow-prisoner, greets them; that Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, should be received by them; that Jesus, called Justus, also greets them; that Epaphras struggles on their behalf in prayers; that Luke and Demas send their greetings; that they should greet the brothers in Laodicea, cause this Epistle to be read in the church of the Laodiceans, and read the one from Laodicea; and that they should tell Archippus to take heed to the ministry which he has received in the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="OLv1qDRjKPpb7WeQhnpjddP7lTbMQ_5E-1ppPPLq1fp8MR8MpzzfwWWMlwmSEija5"> If the book of Colossians did not cover matters which are so weighty, I could understand why Paul would take the time to mention the things recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92834" data-verses="Colossians 4:7-17">4:7-17</span>. But consider <span class="pg" data-page-id="258" id="258">[258]</span> the contrast between the lofty aspects of Christ revealed in this book and Paul’s fellowship at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92835" data-verses="Colossians 4:1">chapter four</span>. Nevertheless, these verses written by Paul are part of Scripture and cannot be taken lightly. Therefore, it is important for us to understand why they are included at the end of this book. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="4IBzwnFeZUmiPTldQylpqjfn86ku4bBeAumWT0F5vBeYLZvZUxnAH8UtbPcg2OgXO">A PRACTICAL APPLICATION</h2><p data-content-id="omf13Bx02SFTK6-4sHpHdKgU2aGjqsigyrvnjZRmemRqzlC_dbZvNK2s_tofFhghm"> If we consider these verses in the light of the whole Epistle, we shall realize that they are a practical application of what Paul covers in this book. We may regard these verses as a window through which we can see into the situation among the churches in the Mediterranean region at the time of Paul. What we see is the practical living of the new man. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92836" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">3:11</span> we are told that in the new man “there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92837" data-verses="Colossians 4:7-17">4:7-17</span> we have a practical illustration of the revelation of the new man given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92838" data-verses="Colossians 3:10-11">3:10 and 11</span>. In these verses different kinds of people are pointed out: Jews, Greeks, circumcision, uncircumcision, slaves, and masters. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92839" data-verses="Colossians 4:11">4:11</span> Paul refers to those who are of the circumcision. Onesimus, who had become a “faithful and beloved brother” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92840" data-verses="Colossians 4:9">v. 9</span>), was a slave belonging to Philemon, who was the father of Archippus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92841" data-verses="Philemon 1:10-13">Philem. 10-13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92842" data-verses="Philemon 1:1-2">1-2</span>). Archippus, therefore, was a master. Hence, Paul’s purpose in these verses is to present an illustration of the living of the new man. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="F8T5SrvVvSK9adYDT1faMIT2tIUYTcOvvK68nXJGmPygBYfXAuqVH6_7nXxzbpNoL">THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE NEW MAN</h2><p data-content-id="CV0IHBXEspCOWkPgBxpK-FPjvRK4Ku12YOitnjJYe71lPdJfo-RTTzkzgsHXnVKBu"> This Epistle was sent from Rome to Colosse. In ancient times this was a long journey. In the geographical region between Rome and Colosse were many different kinds of people. However, in this region near the Mediterranean, the new man had come into being and was living in a practical way. Although travel was not convenient, there was considerable traffic among the churches. There is a lesson for us here. Although we enjoy all the modern conveniences and means of transportation, there may not be as much <span class="pg" data-page-id="259" id="259">[259]</span> traffic among the churches today as there was at the time of Paul. Furthermore, I have to admit that I have never composed a letter containing as many personal greetings as there are in the book of Colossians. Think of how many names are mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92843" data-verses="Colossians 4:7-17">4:7-17</span>: Tychicus, Onesimus, Aristarchus, Mark, Barnabas, Justus, Epaphras, Luke, Demas, Nymphas, and Archippus. Paul also refers to the brothers in Laodicea, the church in the house of Nymphas, and the church of the Laodiceans. (The church in the house of Nymphas was the local church in Laodicea; it met in his house.) All these names indicate that with Paul there was a sense, a consciousness, of the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="P48e1Zv0yLRjkEdD3vDxRlw0vxNxDBSsNs7_pSaWHLCXEoMkdyKlIfpN-GyxhQQiF"> This new man who was living on earth in a practical way was constituted of those who according to culture and social status were Greeks, Jews, circumcision, uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slaves, and freemen. However, as we have pointed out, the actual constituent of the new man is Christ and Christ alone. Because Christ is the unique constituent of the new man, there should be no differences among the believers who are part of this new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="-8P5_We9HlrZyO3mbt2-Dnw28HBjn3ZMPtZfEzTH8mFI2NJZdM2qdWpYHt1XsAb0_"> Furthermore, there should be no differences among the churches, for example, no difference between the church in Laodicea and the church in Colosse. This is proved by Paul’s word regarding the reading of letters: “And when this letter is read among you, cause that it may be read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the one from Laodicea” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92844" data-verses="Colossians 4:16">4:16</span>). What Paul wrote to the Colossians was also for the Laodiceans, and what he wrote to the Laodiceans was for the Colossians. What fellowship, oneness, harmony, and intimate contact this implies! </p>
<p data-content-id="piRKMgn5tqXQZ3-2TvISTCkGLvQ07Q5jTePG4ht9Tcd7P32I3OUf8n-_v44p36SzH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92845" data-verses="Colossians 4:7">4:7</span> Paul says, “All that concerns me, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-slave in the Lord, shall make known to you.” Paul had charged Tychicus to make known to the Colossians all that concerned him. If Paul did not have the consciousness of the new man, he would not have regarded it necessary to give Tychicus such a charge. Rather, he may have thought to himself, “Why should I tell those in Colosse the things that concern me? <span class="pg" data-page-id="260" id="260">[260]</span> They are in Asia Minor, and I am here in Rome, far away from them.” Paul, however, had the sense of the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="vIx9uQjmeEwOiVEgDgH8y0xEYfg03MyCYgINrThFa0OoCG1Z0wmuhOJ40BCNUJHpK"> Those in Colosse also had the consciousness of the new man. If they were not conscious of the new man expressed at that time in the Mediterranean area, they would have considered Paul’s affairs his own personal business and would not have been interested in hearing of them. But both the saints in Colosse, and Paul and those with him, were members of the one new man in actuality. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="W0UKyOT0t1IBxSIccUYMsUMOmRbZ3c_JmT-k52DOjH1qiyrn6ODlKeTuGk-ooeEF4">A PORTRAIT OF THE NEW MAN</h2><p data-content-id="2KhgJ0DuKwQnI2lO6O2N5dgXterpagtkMP3qeHnY675TwiRdcLBNxgl-yEWidZOr3"> As we read through these eleven verses, we find that they are a detailed portrait of the new man living in the Mediterranean area. The existence and living of the new man in a practical way is a matter of tremendous significance. The Roman Empire covered a vast area and embraced many different peoples. In the attempt to unify the people culturally, the Roman Empire used the Greek language. However, the Roman Empire was not successful in uniting the various peoples. The differences among the nations, races, and social classes remained. The Jews were still Jews, and the Greeks were still Greeks. The distinction between slaves and masters was by no means eliminated. But in spite of all the differences among nationalities, races, and classes, there was on earth in a practical way the one new man created in Christ Jesus. There were not merely local churches in various cities—there was one new man in a real and practical way. </p>
<p data-content-id="uei5QW3MGv90tAA2FxD3LJZfZN3-F6R75QFjeBrVrSzVrCFjdoepppbzqxBliOuF8"> It is shameful for the church in any locality to isolate itself from other churches. How wrong it is for us to have the attitude of standing apart from other local churches, fearing that others may interfere with our affairs or otherwise trouble us. This is utterly contrary to the consciousness of the new man. Any church which holds such an attitude has a consciousness only of itself, not of the totality of the new man. Those who insist on this attitude cause the new man to be fragmented, to be broken into pieces. Nevertheless, many churches and many individual believers as well have the attitude that they will <span class="pg" data-page-id="261" id="261">[261]</span> leave others alone if others in turn will leave them alone. They do not care about the churches in other places, and they do not want other churches to be involved with them. Those who have this attitude lack the sense, the consciousness, of the one new man. Praise the Lord for the portrait of the living of the new man in these verses! By these verses we see the practical expression of the new man. </p>

The second section (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92852" data-verses="Colossians 1:9">1:9—3:11</span>) is focused on Christ as the preeminent and all-inclusive One, the centrality and universality of God. This section is the center of the Epistle to the Colossians and contains its subject. The third section (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92853" data-verses="Colossians 3:12">3:12—4:6</span>) covers the living of the saints in union with Christ. In this book we have a full revelation of Christ. Then we are told of the kind of living we should have in union with Christ.

These aspects of Christ are presented in a marvelous sequence. First we see that Christ is the portion of the saints and last that He is the constituent of the new man. This indicates that the ultimate issue of enjoying Christ as our portion is that we experience Him as the content and constituent of the new man. Whenever we enjoy Christ, there is a definite result, an issue, of this enjoyment. To say that the enjoyment of Christ as the portion of the saints results in the experience of Christ as the constituent of <span class="pg" data-page-id="264" id="264">[264]</span> the new man indicates that the enjoyment of Christ results in the church life. However, we should be careful not to reduce the profoundness of the revelation in Colossians. Paul does not tell us in an elementary way that if we enjoy Christ, the church will come into being. This, of course, is true, but such an understanding falls short of the revelation here. Christ is the all-inclusive portion of the saints, typified by the good land. If we enjoy Christ as such a portion, the result will be the new man with Christ as the content. Ultimately, the Christ we enjoy as our portion becomes the constituent of the new man. In this new man Christ is all and in all. Hence, it is crucial for us to learn to live Christ as the constituent of the new man. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ebF32ctwP_e7REaxpIcbMtYbcpYfCvMLDYsGl3bv4T3pP5hTy7t2LO_iBZ3Z1dSVZ">THE PEACE OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="5znjdl0RibbATJcKH_ecb09_hdhFnWQnNfuxNd8ItWQaf-xO-QYNQQKXpfnLolJRo"> If we would live Christ as the constituent of the new man, we need to be ruled by the peace of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92862" data-verses="Colossians 3:12-15">3:12-15</span>) and inhabited by the word of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92863" data-verses="Colossians 3:16-17">3:16-17</span>). The peace of Christ must arbitrate within our being, and the word of Christ must dwell in us richly. As Christians, we have different backgrounds and different concepts. These differences lead to disagreements among us; therefore, there is the need for an arbitrator. This arbitrator is the peace of Christ. It is crucial that the peace of Christ be allowed to preside in our hearts and to speak the final word regarding any controversy among us. </p>
<p data-content-id="c33eAwsfVfXraWL3f3puOBKwteqxS_tqYFcEXib3Lo6hB_NVq0ahbWwl2qspOIzbJ"> If we remember the background of the book of Colossians, we shall realize that among the believers in Colosse there were various parties. One party was in favor of Jewish observances, whereas another favored Gnosticism. These different preferences gave rise to conflicting opinions. For this reason, Paul told them to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in their hearts. The arbitrator should not be their opinions, concepts, choices, or preferences; it should be the peace of Christ, to which we are called in one Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="YHo9_4F4rbtTN6uJrNVKlcVHfbJwaskIM1JeaWPCErK8lD8OYCz-gEq8DCxiWamqp"> We have pointed out that the peace of Christ is the very peace to which Paul refers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92864" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span>, where we are told that Christ “abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in <span class="pg" data-page-id="265" id="265">[265]</span> Himself into one new man, making peace.” This peace is the oneness of the new man, the Body. By abolishing the ordinances, Christ has created the different peoples into one new man. Now within us as members of the new man there is something which Paul terms the peace of Christ. Hence, the peace of Christ is the very oneness of the new man composed of different peoples. Apart from the work of Christ on the cross, there can be no oneness among the different peoples. But through His death Christ has made peace; that is, He has produced oneness. This oneness of the new man is now within us. This oneness, the peace of Christ, must now be permitted to arbitrate in our hearts. It should function as a referee to settle the disputes among various parties. We need to set aside our opinion, our concept, and listen to the word of the indwelling referee. There is no need for us to quarrel or to express our opinion. We should simply let the peace of Christ make the final decision. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ekj8KtyS_lkUZoS96keszutDh2o6C2QcNJn28_oNc3vFOaI1hUNqhE5B4RkV_HSQJ"> Suppose several young brothers are living together in a brothers’ house. Whenever they have problems living together, they should not argue. Instead, they should allow the peace of Christ to arbitrate in their hearts. They should let this peace be the referee who makes the final decisions. In this way, they will live Christ as the constituent of the new man. </p>

We must be willing to set aside our concepts, our opinions, and give place to the word of Christ. If we want the word of Christ to inhabit us, we need to empty our entire inner being. All of our inward parts—our mind, emotion, will, heart, and spirit—must be empty, available to be filled with the word of Christ. This word should not only dwell in us; it should also inhabit us, making its home in every part of our inner being. Oh, may every room and corner of our being be inhabited by the word of Christ! <span class="pg" data-page-id="266" id="266">[266]</span> </p>

This was his main purpose in writing this Epistle. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92865" data-verses="Colossians 1:25-26">1:25 and 26</span> Paul says, “I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God, the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations, but now has been manifested to His saints.” These verses indicate that the word of God completed by Paul is the mystery now manifested to the saints. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92866" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">verse 27</span>, this mystery is Christ in us, the hope of glory. The goal of this mystery is to produce the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="NvL9nhfr9y1MfkuCnJjWc5-mAmQZRLH-02hvDSNt9dQdENu8DeMorULDAd59B1LCF"> At the time the book of Colossians was written, Judaism had been in existence for centuries, and the church had come into being. Nevertheless, even though the church had come into being, the word of God had not yet been completed. Paul was troubled by the situation at Colosse. The Jewish and Gentile believers were neglecting Christ and the church; they were focusing their attention on such things as Judaistic observances and heathen philosophy. Many people, Jews and Christians alike, claimed to know God and to worship Him. However, Christ was being neglected and the genuine church life was being set aside. Therefore, Paul wrote the Epistle to the Colossians in order to complete the word of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="t5iqp8-G4gD5mGLTCIR_DHqa5S8d6vluKEbpWrQpW1yZ_muRMBVOIaTGcMROMFrnI"> In principle, the situation today is the same as that in Colosse at the time Paul wrote to the Colossians. Judaism and Christianity have been on earth for centuries. Although the Jews have the Old Testament and the Christians have the entire Bible, very few people truly are experiencing <span class="pg" data-page-id="267" id="267">[267]</span> Christ for the proper church life. Christ is still neglected, and the church life is still ignored. Hence, there is still the need for the word of God to be completed in a practical way. </p>

I doubt that very many readers of this book, even among us, have truly seen the revelation it contains. For this reason, many readers concentrate on points such as the comforting of the hearts in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92878" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">2:2</span>. The focal point of Colossians is not the comforting of the hearts. Rather, the focal point is Christ as the mystery of God. Even <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92879" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">2:2</span>, which speaks of the hearts being comforted, makes this clear: “That their hearts may be comforted, being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.” The result of the comforting of our hearts is that we have the full knowledge of Christ as the mystery of God. Therefore, the focal point is not the comforted heart; it is Christ as the mystery of God. </p>

In 1 Corinthians, Paul deals with various negative things, even sinful things, which frustrated the Corinthians from the proper enjoyment of Christ and from the church life. In Galatians Paul deals with the law and with the Jewish religion. However, it is not easy to point out what Paul is dealing with in the Epistle to the Colossians. Some expositors have pointed out that Paul deals with such matters as angel worship and asceticism. Although this view is correct, it relates only to the outward appearance of this book. Actually, in Colossians Paul <span class="pg" data-page-id="274" id="274">[274]</span> is dealing with the hidden matter of man’s culture. A strong indicator of this is the use of the word barbarian in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92880" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">3:11</span>, a word not used in either <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92881" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">1 Corinthians 12:13</span> or <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92882" data-verses="Galatians 3:28">Galatians 3:28</span>, verses parallel to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92883" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">Colossians 3:11</span>. Paul’s use of the word barbarian in Colossians indicates that this Epistle deals with culture. </p>
<p data-content-id="9CMGouSfiMWAlo_AF78CKdna_33884-Yi6ay6JvhbqmWxQR8qwvMZ9jTvWt74Euid"> The source of the trouble among the believers in Colosse was culture, Jewish culture and Greek culture. I believe that all the churches in Asia Minor had been saturated with Jewish culture, particularly with respect to religious observances, and with Greek culture, particularly related to philosophy. At the time of Paul, the culture in the Mediterranean region included three main elements: Jewish religion, Greek philosophy, and Roman politics. Two of these elements—Jewish religion and Greek philosophy—had invaded the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="jSqu1fKMETv3AEO0jRP6XSxNFax2Tgp3Bj8ZR-J9t-t3Qs846TNRWzfLsChMbFjod"> Just as culture exerted a strong influence on the believers in Colosse, culture today exerts a strong influence on us. Unconsciously we are under the influence of the culture into which we were born. It seems that the religious and philosophical elements of culture are part of our being. In many groups in Christianity the political element of culture is present also. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="uei5QW3MGv90tAA2FxD3LJZfZNX-F4R75QFjeBrVrSzVrCFjdoepppbzqxBliOuF8">A WARNING CONCERNING HUMILITY<br/>AND ANGEL WORSHIP</h2><p data-content-id="f5FHReDvsyzvBMFzyvsIslz0ROVlMYqgmUB6rb4-E6X-5JRriI2ZE461KcHMoNa9f"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92884" data-verses="Colossians 2:18">2:18</span> Paul says, “Let no one purposely defraud you of your prize, in humility and worship of the angels, standing on things which he has seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh.” Here Paul warns the believers not to be defrauded through humility. He does not warn them about fleshly indulgence. Humility is one of the best human virtues. In many ethical teachings, a high value is placed on humility. In certain respects, humility is even a finer virtue than love. But even humility can be used to defraud the believers of the enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ij7bPPSnYgJ7k5YLk7p3WF7OHvU49jispqhi6sQh09yxxcsmTBisNQ0qrwyEIQciJ"> In this verse Paul also warns us not to be defrauded through the worship of angels. Humility is related to ethical <span class="pg" data-page-id="275" id="275">[275]</span> philosophy, whereas the worship of angels is related to religion. Angel worship is not crude. On the contrary, it is a refined, cultured, cultivated, and highly-developed form of idolatry. It is much finer than the pagan worship of animals. It is the worship of heavenly beings who are close to God. It was through such beings that the law was given. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92885" data-verses="Colossians 2:18">2:18</span> Paul refers to both philosophy and religion. These aspects of culture can be used by the enemy to defraud us of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="HJXSCv7FjRX11Nlg8l5j7efQl7ngONZ6T3GdC5v5dCb9ChbHCNsZDKBUk5DL1WVtx"> The principle is the same today. Satan, the subtle one, is still using ethics and religion to defraud Christians of the enjoyment of Christ. In saying this, I am not referring to others, such as those in the Catholic religion, but especially to us in the Lord’s recovery. Some may agree that humility could defraud them of Christ, but they would not admit to being defrauded of Him by the worship of angels. Although we may not actually worship angels, we may admire them. Moreover, we may admire many things that are not God Himself. </p>

Culture is the unconscious living of every human being. This is true both of primitive society and of advanced countries as well. The principle is the same everywhere. People throughout the world are under the influence of their culture. Those in the Far East may find it difficult to speak spontaneously in public meetings because they are unconsciously influenced by oriental culture. According to the book of Colossians, what defrauds us of the enjoyment of Christ and frustrates the church life is our culture. </p>
<p data-content-id="J_nFMNQorB6p2GT8JBzVIJEJihdRIYNHJ9mfOn7jgTGQpHDcX8vywWDQZdhqUypmp"> The book of Colossians speaks to our need today. Mainly we are not troubled by the sinful things, as in 1 Corinthians, nor by the law, as in Galatians. But we are all unconsciously and subconsciously under the influence of culture. When we came into the church life, we brought our culture with us. This culture is now undermining our enjoyment of Christ. Culture is the systematic method we have developed to exist <span class="pg" data-page-id="276" id="276">[276]</span> and to maintain our being. The stronger our culture is, the more critical we shall be of others. Based upon the culture we have, we develop our type of asceticism, our own practices to restrict the indulgence of the flesh. Our asceticism is the method we devise to restrain ourselves and to keep from doing sinful things. </p>

Christ is the portion of the saints, the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of creation, the mystery of God’s economy, the firstborn from among the dead, the fullness of God, the mystery of God, the One in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden, and the Body of all the shadows. Eventually, this preeminent, all-inclusive Christ is the unique constituent of the new man. Furthermore, as Paul declares in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92886" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">3:4</span>, this Christ is our life. The expression “our life” is a strong indication that we are to experience in our daily living the Christ revealed in this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="bII_pa96wW65xpS_TOga8Qb0v0Wg1fUpsR-fiE2GZ2XncQE7FKuNnsp2sqi-cXeIt"> For our physical existence, everything depends on our having life. If there is no life in your body, then everything else related to you is terminated. For example, if you have no life, how could you have such things as love or submission? Everything associated with the human living is based on having human life. If the life is terminated, everything else is terminated also. This underscores the importance of Christ being our life. It is vital for us to see that the all-inclusive Christ is our life. According to the revelation of the New Testament, this Christ has been processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. </p>

If we allow the peace of Christ to arbitrate in our hearts, this peace will settle all the disputes among us. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="277" id="277">[277]</span> saints in Colosse were troubled by different isms, philosophies, and practices. Just as a referee is needed to settle disputes in a game or contest, so the Colossians needed a referee, an arbitrator, to calm down all the differing opinions. It is significant that only in the book of Colossians, a book that deals with culture and its isms and practices, does Paul speak of the inward arbitration of the peace of Christ. This arbitrator calms down all the opinions which have their source in our culture. </p>

<p class="scripture" data-content-id="wrbcmMjVyCQkgWdRivfLA0DYusEMPq-d3uqzGEffBGQc6UVl06Y-KY2UHVu1-W7x4">Scripture Reading: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92891" data-verses="Colossians 1:12-29">Col. 1:12-29</span></p><p data-content-id="LGGjP-PAOdJ8nFxUYQbpLuUq0BcMX8ShMQZw72ekAlg3c478l-zKR4IjWE4Bf53rA"> In this message we shall consider the all-inclusive Christ as revealed in Colossians. Most of the saints in the Lord’s recovery are familiar with this term, “the all-inclusive Christ.” In various messages we have emphasized that the Christ in the book of Colossians is the all-inclusive One. Nevertheless, I do not have much assurance that the all-inclusiveness of Christ has been revealed adequately to the saints. In what way is Christ all-inclusive? In what aspects, items, and matters is He all-inclusive? We need to be able to point out the various aspects of the all-inclusiveness of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="mLlsVgAIb-skAhfjqngkuMQK3_BuuRA-Eh0Y8vVQpH3WrdTCEmNX27ibG0XFE_F6p"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92892" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">1:12</span> we see that Christ is the portion of the saints. But not even this general term tells us in what aspects Christ is all-inclusive. To say that Christ is our portion is like saying that we have just eaten dinner. What particular courses made up the dinner? Many things can be put together and called a dinner. We may proclaim that Christ is our portion. But in what particular way is He our portion? Concerning the all-inclusiveness of Christ, we need to be more definite and specific. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZIaYAIUhlPYkrS-W4qNUAjewWcO-FN35Enf7GKa9aNGLCeSPPJyL_qRbhaKXPVpri">THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="A9Ho75-1IEWiI5pZAWtoolFIBFaNitwDjip1OYh6Z3Q5wGMSc15rgkFYdiHX9QQ7d"> According to Colossians, the first aspect of the all-inclusiveness of Christ is that He is the image of the invisible God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92893" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">1:15</span>). This aspect of Christ’s all-inclusiveness involves all the verses from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92894" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">1:15</span> to the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92895" data-verses="Colossians 1:1">chapter one</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92896" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">verse 15</span> Paul says, “Who is the image of the invisible God, <span class="pg" data-page-id="282" id="282">[282]</span> Firstborn of all creation.” As we read this verse, it is easy for us mentally to insert the conjunction “and” between the words “God” and “firstborn.” To do this is to greatly change this verse, for the conjunction would imply that the image and the firstborn are two different things. However, the phrase “firstborn of all creation” actually stands in apposition to “the image of the invisible God.” The image of the invisible God is expressed in the firstborn of all creation. Furthermore, the firstborn of all creation is the image of the invisible God. As the image of the invisible God, Christ is the firstborn of all creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="NvL9nhfr9y1MfkuCnJjWc5-mAnwZRJH-02hvDSNt9dQdENu8DeMorULDAd59B1LCF"> The image of God denotes the expression of God, just as the image of a person denotes that person’s expression. If we did not have an image, we would have no way to express ourselves. Christ is God’s expression, God’s image. As God’s image, Christ expresses God in being the firstborn of all creation. The entire universe is the expression of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="t5iqp8-G4gD5mGLTCIR_DHqa5Tcd6tluKEbpWrQpW1yZ_muRMBVOIaTGcMROMFrnI">A BIRD’S-EYE VIEW OF THE BIBLE</h2><p data-content-id="h3ZNAj-7-mNpWfPCijhB17Zq-NbLJTqT5I-hwnsewSx8Ec6pwTMhh2r5WyeY8HZbS"> Regarding this aspect of the all-inclusiveness of Christ, it is helpful to have a bird’s-eye view of the Bible, God’s complete revelation. Although it is true to say that the Bible reveals God, the Bible is not simple in its revelation of Him. Genesis opens with the words, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Heb.). Then in the opening verses of Malachi, the last book of the Old Testament, God is revealed as the one who loves Jacob. In the Old Testament God is revealed as the Creator of the universe and as the One who loves Israel. No wonder that the Jews love the Old Testament! </p>
<p data-content-id="U-smkr1a6dFJm6oEW-7auOkFl_nXeIFwUVyMfwU3YgBr5P5j6Up1AlI-ogYff8uiJ"> Coming to the New Testament, we see that Matthew begins with the words, “The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.” The Gospel of John opens like this: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” In the last book of the New Testament, Revelation, we read the following: “John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is, and who was, and who is <span class="pg" data-page-id="283" id="283">[283]</span> coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92897" data-verses="Revelation 1:4-5">1:4-5a</span>). What a difference there is between these verses in Revelation and the opening words of Genesis! They even far surpass the beginning of Matthew and John. Today we are in the local churches. To the churches there is a dispensation not only from God or from the Word, but from the Triune God: from Him who is, who was, and who is coming, from the seven Spirits, and from Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="MbvcrlXtA4GGPOZNOvDot4_k4KkO4-YWsRhB1iUfY2NjrQ3EE-RVlAKh7NIKw-9kI"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92898" data-verses="Revelation 1:5">Revelation 1:5</span> Christ is described as “the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth.” The name Jesus implies the incarnation, and the title Christ indicates that the Lord Jesus is God’s anointed One. He was the faithful Witness in His human living, and He is the Firstborn of the dead in His resurrection. In His ascension and enthronement He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth, for He is now Lord and Head of all. Furthermore, He will rule over all nations when He comes to reign in His kingdom. Therefore, the description of Christ in this verse covers everything from Christ’s incarnation to His eternal kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="Vehc_DxwcgXUMWVvg6ZqRxQAe82kSJcmilbKcMYbZp13kc_c_BsTJjIrnVSGak81f"> The divine revelation in the Bible shows that Christ as the all-inclusive One is for the church. In an even more definite way, the book of Revelation shows that He is for the churches. Hence, the revelation of the Bible is that Christ is for the churches. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="iiCXRFpuXcPrT8Ib2ei9Wmk1ElJyhe2ws6tpqdIZHirz4qBni4rQoR_fScofdndKl">CULTURE—A FRUSTRATION TO GOD’S PURPOSE</h2><p data-content-id="1aJmujdY8zf3BLa1Nx2x7qmP39SUNgu3l_vTi90iiOmndjKLwrW8aLxpNk6UPXsej"> Through the fall of man, certain negative things have come in to interfere with Christ being for the church. These negative things include Satan, sin, and the world. It is rather easy to realize that such things are a frustration to God’s purpose. But something else that is very subtle stands in the way of Christ and the church; this subtle opposing element is culture. Although the word culture is not found in the New Testament, it is nonetheless a fact that culture is a frustration to God’s purpose. <span class="pg" data-page-id="284" id="284">[284]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="9CMGouSfiMWAlo_AF78CKdna_2H81oeYi6ay6JvhbqmWxQR8qwvMZ9jTvWt74Euid"> In 1 Corinthians Paul deals with various negative things such as fornication and division. These fleshly things were keeping the believers in Corinth from the proper enjoyment of Christ. In Galatians Paul deals with the law and the ordinances of Judaism, which were frustrating the believers in Galatia from enjoying Christ. In the book of Colossians what keeps the believers from the enjoyment of Christ is culture. </p>
<p data-content-id="jSqu1fKMETv3AEO0jRP6XSxNFbB2bwZ3Bj8ZR-J9t-t3Qs846TNRWzfLsChMbFjod"> The main elements of the culture in Colosse at the time of Paul were Jewish religion and Greek philosophy. Hebrew culture and Greek culture came together in Asia Minor and formed a mixture. Certain Jews and Greeks in Colosse were brought into the church. When they came into the church life, they brought their different cultural backgrounds with them. To say that we have different backgrounds actually means that we have different cultures. The Jewish believers in Colosse had a background of Jewish culture, and the Greek believers had a background of Greek culture. We know from our own experience that to come into the church life does not necessarily mean that we give up our cultural background. Like the Jewish and Greek believers in Colosse, we may seek to bring into the church life certain aspects of our culture that we consider important and valuable. </p>
<p data-content-id="Twq0tWAMk6bVuZEt9Z9lD5HOEQoTStIdL3jAfCQiy5hBnTJuAz_YAL8NdDTj2RtGV"> We know that we are still under the influence of our cultural background by the way we react when others speak either critically or favorably about our background. For example, if I speak positively about Jewish culture, the Jewish believers will be happy. But if I speak negatively about their culture, they may be displeased. In the same principle, if I encourage the Chinese saints not to go to Chinatown, they may be unhappy. But if I say a good word about Chinese culture, they will be glad. </p>
<p data-content-id="nAAjrYoSxORsKcXED0Y92nk_lPG8dCrYu242cBU-V2b50Voz0s71JJrl7esVgPqMx"> Our culture includes not only our nationality, but even our special feeling toward a certain region of the country. The New Englanders favor New England, and the Texans are proud of Texas. These illustrations show how prevailing is the influence of culture and how difficult it is for us to drop our background. <span class="pg" data-page-id="285" id="285">[285]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="6lc_KG4lpSEXBWvOfF9n73K2ETNBidqSbKVHRXhoCGalmrzef-H9gsKXflDUdQgSY"> At Colosse Jewish and Greek culture invaded the church life and permeated it. The church life, however, should be absolutely in Christ, with Christ, of Christ, by Christ, and for Christ. But when culture pervades the church, the church is no longer for Christ. Instead, it is for man’s culture. Then, instead of being the church of Christ, it becomes the church of some kind of culture. </p>

<p data-content-id="W0UKyOT0t1IBxSIccUYMsUMOmQbZwP_JmT-k52DOjH1qiyrn6ODlKeTuGk-ooeEF4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92917" data-verses="Colossians 2:3">2:3</span> Paul tells us that all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92918" data-verses="Colossians 2:4">verse 4</span> he goes on to say, “This I say that no one may delude you with persuasive speech.” This indicates that at that time in Colosse the saints were being deluded through persuasive speech. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2KhgJ0DuKwQnI2lO6O2N5dgXtfrpcz9kMP3qeHnY675TwiRdcLBNxgl-yEWidZOr3">THE TRADITION OF MEN</h2><p data-content-id="uei5QW3MGv90tAA2FxD3LJZfZM3-Mqx75QFjeBrVrSzVrCFjdoepppbzqxBliOuF8"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92919" data-verses="Colossians 2:8">verse 8</span> Paul says, “Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.” In this verse Paul gives us a serious warning about being carried off as prey through someone’s philosophy and empty words. Such philosophy and empty deceit are according to the tradition of men. </p>
<p data-content-id="f5FHReDvsyzvBMFzyvsIslz0RP1lEKagmUB6rb4-E6X-5JRriI2ZE461KcHMoNa9f"> Tradition is related to culture and has its source in culture. There can be no tradition apart from culture. Both religious people and philosophical ones are strong in their tradition. The more cultured we are, the more traditions we have. All peoples have their particular traditions. In ancient times the Jews had their traditions, and the Greeks had theirs. Furthermore, believers today have their Christian traditions, and we all have our individual traditions. The only way to have no tradition is to not have any culture. As long as we have some kind of culture, we shall have traditions. Some of our traditions may even be self-made and self-imposed. All traditions are according to man, <span class="pg" data-page-id="292" id="292">[292]</span> for God does not have any traditions. Therefore, there are no traditions that are according to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="aw_owglmYsbhVQpnqDeZZJvwRgVpyIPcebdjcPDhLYFI9FSkEF8RpLBEHkqv-h5U3"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92920" data-verses="Colossians 2:8">2:8</span> the phrase “according to the elements of the world” is in apposition to “according to the tradition of men.” This indicates that the tradition of men and the elements of the world are identical. The world here refers not to the physical world, but to fallen mankind, the same as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92921" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>. The traditions are equal to the elements, and the men are equal to the world. Hence, the tradition of men is synonymous with the elements of the world. </p>
<p data-content-id="bII_pa96wW65xpS_TOga8Qb0v12g1dUpsR-fiE2GZ2XncQE7FKuNnsp2sqi-cXeIt"> In this verse Paul points out that philosophy and empty deceit are not according to Christ. The expression “according to Christ” is very important. It indicates that everything should be estimated and evaluated according to Christ. As we consider ourselves, our families, situations, and environment, we should evaluate them, not according to the tradition of men, but according to Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qcLWvpSjI1XL62hLozF8aNmkdfcb7BaDsla5rdBghIZYVZKEAFjA56Gig5TWSCGAX">NOT INSISTING ON CERTAIN THINGS</h2><p data-content-id="yrS9bX0cFSGgVgun4Ufhw1Icncbv8ieF1ONqnoyndBoPJWI5e-rH93nABe6-78JSB"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92922" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">Verse 16</span> says, “Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths.” Here we see the matter of judgments and opinions. We make judgments because we insist on certain things. For example, if we insist on a certain way of eating, we shall make judgments according to what we insist on. On the other hand, we shall be judged by others because of it. If I insist that all the saints eat Cantonese food, I shall be judged by them. But if I do not insist on any particular kind of food, I shall not be criticized with respect to food. The same is true regarding drinking and the observing of days. </p>
<p data-content-id="8W3SYV3ote4j4Rg0nTLNGDsafX7YGmmEc9qelKbjNksm4WKd2cErScxTa7rBwQTLq"> To say that we do not insist on anything means that we are neither religious nor philosophical. Those who are religious or philosophical always insist on certain things. Their insisting causes others to judge them and criticize them. Hence, if we are not to let others judge us, we ourselves should not insist on certain things. <span class="pg" data-page-id="293" id="293">[293]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92930" data-verses="Colossians 2:22">verse 22</span> we see that such ordinances are according to the commandments and teachings of men.

The saints were being deluded and carried off as prey. Furthermore, they were being judged and defrauded of their prize. The best inventions of culture were deceiving the saints and depriving them of Christ. These aspects of culture were replacing Christ. In the experience of the saints, they had become substitutes for Christ. Therefore, Paul wrote this book to deal with this problem. </p>
<p data-content-id="riqDpjchUDoSOoMli_WZl-Ii3rMFHOtu7gQhs2g1WdrF9hCb4rF0iMESoWGxdqC3t"> In Colossians, a book that is higher in revelation than either 1 Corinthians or Galatians, Paul deals with culture made up of religion and philosophy. For human society, philosophy and religion are necessary and good. If society were without religion and philosophy, people would be barbaric. They would behave like wild beasts. Although religion and philosophy are necessary for human society, there is no place for them in the church life. These two things are substitutes for Christ. The church needs Christ, a living, all-inclusive Person, not religion or philosophy. <span class="pg" data-page-id="294" id="294">[294]</span> </p>

One especially troubling expression is the “firstborn of all creation” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92931" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">1:15</span>). Although some theologians talk freely about Christ as the image of the invisible God, they are reluctant to expound this troubling phrase. But Paul says that the One who is the image of the invisible God is the firstborn of all creation. Theologians may be happy to point out that as the firstborn from among the dead, Christ was the first to be resurrected. However, very few are willing to point out that, as the firstborn of all creation, Christ is also the first of the creatures. Anyone who follows Paul to make such a statement may be condemned as heretical. Nevertheless, we cannot remove from our Bibles Paul’s word which says that Christ is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="KavjviC-d0XiSiopL73LYAPbvxuJf_ScsRXMlBkeWvyXWct-X5tTcxic3H8-f0epm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92932" data-verses="Colossians 1:16">1:16</span> Paul tells us that all things were created in Christ. This includes things both in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible. Even those things which Jews regard as unclean, including turtles, frogs, snakes, and swine, were among the things created in Christ. The first time I read this verse according to the Greek-English Interlinear translation, I was greatly surprised. I said to myself, “Is Paul saying that even turtles and snakes were created in Christ?” No doubt Paul’s word includes these creatures also. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92933" data-verses="Colossians 1:16">Colossians 1:16</span> is a hard blow to Gnostic philosophy. We have pointed out that, according to Gnosticism, the material world, including man’s body, is inherently evil. But Paul declares that all things were created in Christ and that Christ Himself is the firstborn of all creation. These statements deal with the concepts of both Greeks and Jews. Since all things were created in Christ, we should not regard creation as intrinsically evil, nor despise any aspect of God’s creation in Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="295" id="295">[295]</span> </p>

It is crucial for us to learn to estimate all things and to evaluate them, not according to our cultural mentality, but according to Christ. For example, our viewpoint with respect to marriage should be not according to our culture; it should be according to Christ. I very much appreciate the expression “according to Christ.” We should not allow anything to be a substitute for Christ or to replace Him. Christ and Christ alone is the standard and basis of measurement. This means that we should not evaluate things according to culture, according to tradition or the elements of the world. In the church Christ is the only measurement, standard, and basis. This is a basic principle in the practice of the church life. </p>

In saying that Christ is versus culture, we are not saying that we should drop our culture and then live without any culture whatever. If we try to drop our culture in this way, we shall simply develop another form of culture, a culture of dropping our culture. Without culture, people would become beasts. Those who do not have Christ certainly need to live according to culture. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="aw_owglmYsbhVQpnqDeZZJvwRglp1avcebdjcPDhLYFI9FSkEF8RpLBEHkqv-h5U3">GOD’S INTENTION</h2><p data-content-id="bII_pa96wW65xpS_TOga8Qb0v1GgzPkpsR-fiE2GZ2XncQE7FKuNnsp2sqi-cXeIt"> Concerning this matter of the all-inclusive Christ versus culture, we need to see that according to the full revelation in the Bible God’s intention is to work Himself into His chosen people. This intention is the focal point of the divine revelation in the Scriptures. In order for God to work Himself into us, He must be triune. It is a wonderful and marvelous fact that God is triune—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father as the source is embodied in the Son, who is the very expression of the Father. When the Son comes, He always comes with the Father. This indicates that the Father cannot be separated from the Son, nor the Son from the Father. The Son is the embodiment, reality, and expression of the Father. Through the process of death and resurrection, the Son became the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92955" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>), the Holy Spirit who gives life. Hence, the Spirit is the realization of the Son, even as the Son is the embodiment of the Father. <span class="pg" data-page-id="304" id="304">[304]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="qcLWvpSjI1XL62hLozF8aNmkdfsbyTaDsla5rdBghIZYVZKEAFjA56Gig5TWSCGAX"> The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three Gods, but one God in His tri-unity. Because God is triune, He can dispense Himself into us. God came to us in the Son through Christ’s incarnation. Christ died on the cross to redeem us and to terminate the old creation. Then in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. On the one hand, Christ is sitting on the throne in the heavens as the Head and Lord of all. On the other hand, as the Spirit He dwells within us to be our life. As the life-giving Spirit, Christ is our life supply, and He is to us the reality of every positive thing. </p>
<p data-content-id="yrS9bX0cFSGgVgun4Ufhw1Icncrv0wOF1ONqnoyndBoPJWI5e-rH93nABe6-78JSB"> As the all-inclusive Spirit, the Triune God is working Himself into our being. The deepest part of our being is the spirit, which is surrounded by the soul and the body. Man’s physical body contains the soul, and the soul contains the spirit, which is a vessel to receive God and contain Him. Christ as the processed, all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is in our spirit, seeking to spread Himself into all the parts of our soul and eventually to saturate our bodies to make us absolutely the same as He is. When this takes place, our whole being will be permeated with Himself. This is God’s salvation according to His economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9CMGouSfiMWAlo_AF78CKdna_2n81qeYi6ay6JvhbqmWxQR8qwvMZ9jTvWt74Euid">CULTURE HINDERING OUR EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="jSqu1fKMETv3AEO0jRP6XSxNFbh2byZ3Bj8ZR-J9t-t3Qs846TNRWzfLsChMbFjod"> Many things hinder the accomplishment of God’s full salvation. Two of the more obvious hindrances are sin and worldliness. The most subtle hindrance, however, is culture. Culture frustrates God’s chosen people from experiencing Christ and enjoying Him. The all-inclusive Christ is versus culture. However, we are not saying that we should drop our culture and act like barbarians. We are by no means encouraging anyone to act as if we are free of culture. Those who do not have Christ certainly need culture. As children are growing up, they need not only culture, but also the law. But after we have received Christ, we should not allow our culture to limit Christ or to frustrate us from experiencing Him. Prior to receiving Christ, all people need culture. But after receiving Christ, we should live according to Christ, not according to culture. Do not think that culture is <span class="pg" data-page-id="305" id="305">[305]</span> unnecessary. Culture preserves, regulates, and improves people. But after Christ has come into us, in our experience we should begin to live by Christ. The problem is that Christ is limited by our culture. </p>
<p data-content-id="Twq0tWAMk6bVuZEt9Z9lD5HOEQITRtodL3jAfCQiy5hBnTJuAz_YAL8NdDTj2RtGV"> We have seen that God’s intention is to work Christ into His chosen people. God uses culture to preserve people until they receive Christ. Before children receive Christ, they must be trained according to culture and under the law. Never tell little children that they have no need for culture. On the contrary, teach them to honor their parents, to love others, and to share their possessions with others. Eventually, when they attain to a certain maturity, they will decide to receive Christ into them. Then we need to help them grow into Christ and with Christ. Gradually we can help them turn from culture to Christ. Eventually, instead of living according to culture, they will live according to Christ. Young people, do not proclaim that you have dropped your culture. Instead, testify to others that you have received Christ and that now you are living Christ, growing Christ, and producing Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="nAAjrYoSxORsKcXED0Y92nk_lPm8eCLYu242cBU-V2b50Voz0s71JJrl7esVgPqMx"> In his subtlety Satan will use good things, even things given by God, to keep us from experiencing Christ. Even the Bible has been used by Satan to frustrate people from the enjoyment of Christ. However, nothing keeps people from Christ more than culture. Culture is a frustration especially to those Christians who truly love the Lord. In fact, the more we love Him, the more culture will hinder us from experiencing Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="6lc_KG4lpSEXBWvOfF9n73K2ETtBhcKSbKVHRXhoCGalmrzef-H9gsKXflDUdQgSY"> Let us consider as an illustration the case of Peter. Although Peter was a fisherman, he was familiar with Jewish theology. One day, Peter received the inspiration to say that the Lord Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God. The Lord replied that Peter received this revelation from the Father in heaven. Then He went on to speak about the building up of the church and about the cross (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92956" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matt. 16:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92957" data-verses="Matthew 16:24">24</span>). In the book of Acts we see that Peter was used by the Lord to establish the first local church, the church in Jerusalem. Although Peter was used by the Lord in this way, he was still <span class="pg" data-page-id="306" id="306">[306]</span> limited by his Jewish culture. This is proved by Peter’s experience in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92958" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span>. As Peter was praying, his experience of the Spirit was limited by his cultural concepts concerning Gentiles. Peter thought that the enjoyment of Christ was limited to Jews. As a typical Jew, he thought of the Gentiles, the heathen, as swine. His attitude toward them was a product of Jewish culture. Although Peter was one with the Lord, his experience of Christ was confined by culture. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92959" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span> Peter saw a vision of a great sheet “wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92960" data-verses="Acts 10:12">v. 12</span>). When a voice said to him, “Rise, Peter; kill, and eat,” Peter answered, “Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92961" data-verses="Acts 10:13-14">vv. 13-14</span>). This vision came to Peter three times. As Peter was considering what this vision might mean, some Gentiles arrived at the place where he was staying and asked about him. God’s intention was to expand the enjoyment of Christ to include the Gentiles. For this enlargement of the experience of Christ, there was the need for Peter to lay aside his cultural background. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="RfNO2lIzA5Rw54npqQTHNA_TJjM6euAgvd8yXLZ0NJhLX6FOEZQflozxR78uf33Oy">CULTURE REPLACED BY CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="sQ-jiCKNjXFon2Sit_5DdVXU7cCLS7qUaRJLlAaDAC4Gkuj3zqfMcEH9tudAOZTWi"> However, we should not endeavor to drop our culture without such a vision of Christ. But as soon as the vision comes, we must set aside our cultural background and not allow it to replace Christ or to restrict Him. When Christ comes in, our culture must go. But we should not try to drop culture without Christ. Actually our concern is not with culture—it is for the experience of Christ. The point we are making is that since we have received Christ, we should not allow culture to become a substitute for Him. In Christ we have the liberty to set aside our culture in order to enlarge our capacity to enjoy the Lord. All the room within us must be given over to Christ. If our entire inward capacity is made available to Him, spontaneously the culture within us will be replaced by Christ. However, it is terrible to drop culture apart from Christ. But when Christ comes, we should tell the <span class="pg" data-page-id="307" id="307">[307]</span> Lord that we want Him to possess and occupy all the ground within us. </p>

This Person is the all-inclusive Christ, the One who is the reality of every positive thing in the universe. Christ is the firstborn of all creation. He is both God and man, for the One who was the eternal God became incarnated at a point in time. Hence, Christ is the real God and the real man.

<p data-content-id="QoYPkMNcmTS0w0HcQG2WFMBh7jZNqMHo00ymhHKS1B0KuZrfvJx-ndqeKB8A9ADgi"> First the work of creation was accomplished, then Christ became a man, the first step of the long process through which He passed. As a man, He lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years. How marvelous that the infinite God lived in a carpenter’s home in a small town! God was confined and limited in this way. After passing through human living with its sufferings, trials, and temptations, Christ was crucified on the cross. His death was a wonderful, all-inclusive death. After His burial in a tomb, He took a <span class="pg" data-page-id="314" id="314">[314]</span> tour of the region of death, and then came forth in resurrection. After His resurrection, Christ ascended to the heavens, where He was enthroned, crowned, and made the Lord and the Head of all. </p>
<p data-content-id="KavjviC-d0XiSiopL73LYAPbvxOJUtCcsRXMlBkeWvyXWct-X5tTcxic3H8-f0epm"> In His resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92979" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>). All that Christ has passed through, all that He is, and all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained are the ingredients which have been compounded into Him as the all-inclusive Spirit. As this all-inclusive Spirit, He descended upon His Body on the day of Pentecost. In this Spirit, we have God, man, incarnation, human living, redemption, the effectiveness of Christ’s death, the power of His resurrection, resurrection life, ascension, enthronement, headship, and lordship. This is the all-inclusive One whom God desires to work into us for the fulfillment of His economy. This dispensation of the all-inclusive Christ into us is for God’s purpose and eternal plan. This is our Christ, the One we love and enjoy. </p>
<p data-content-id="BOCvS1r-7tIB54EhOvqqTqjp0rEq6apvx43xAqzzl996JaIsWLw395nl-aNWe_mB3"> The Bible reveals that God is triune: He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. If we read the Bible carefully, we shall see that the Father is in the Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92980" data-verses="John 14:10">John 14:10</span>) and that the Son is even called the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92981" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isa. 9:6</span>). Those who have seen the Son have also seen the Father. Furthermore, the Son has become the Spirit of reality. This indicates that the Son is realized as the Spirit. When the Triune God reaches us, He is the all-inclusive Spirit. Our Christ is such a Spirit for our experience and enjoyment today. </p>

Formerly, by birth, we were in Adam. But God, the Father, has transferred us out of Adam into Christ. When we believed in the Lord Jesus and called on His name, we were transferred from Adam into Christ. This is the reason that after we believed into Christ, we were baptized. In the words of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92983" data-verses="Romans 6:3">Romans 6:3</span>, we have been baptized into Christ Jesus. <span class="pg" data-page-id="315" id="315">[315]</span> </p>

This position does give us the right and privilege to participate in all that Christ is. But with this right and privilege, we need to experience Christ living in us. Now that we are in Christ, Christ wants to live in us. This is not a matter of position, but a matter of experience and enjoyment. For us to be in Christ is a matter of position; for Christ to be in us is a matter of experience and enjoyment. How much we enjoy Christ depends upon how much He lives in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="KavjviC-d0XiSiopL73LYAPbvxOJc-ycsRXMlBkeWvyXWct-X5tTcxic3H8-f0epm"> If we were not in Christ, Christ could not be in us. According to the New Testament, Christ’s being in us is based upon the fact that we are in Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92984" data-verses="John 15:4">John 15:4</span>, the Lord Jesus said, “Abide in Me and I in you.” If we abide in Christ, He will abide in us. Once again we see that to be in Christ is a matter of position, whereas to have Christ in us is a matter of experience and enjoyment. My burden in this message is not to tell you that we are in Christ. It is to point out that Christ is in us. Simply knowing that we are in Christ does not give us the experience of Christ or the enjoyment of Christ. However, this position does give us the right and privilege to claim the enjoyment and experience of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="lGebDchapj8MhaQa-6qJi3EWkzv6DDoIEBHfdfUryVbKKL4PAwixxjPTbBKYDu4Le"> We should have the confidence to say that we are in Christ wholly, absolutely, and thoroughly. Concerning our position in Christ, we may be assured that we are in Him entirely. For example, anyone who is an American citizen is a citizen wholly, thoroughly, and absolutely. His citizenship is not partial or conditional. However, how much this person enjoys America is relative to how much of America has gotten into him. He is in America, but how much of America is in him? A person from another country may become a naturalized American citizen. Thus, he is altogether an American by citizenship. However, he may still have within him a great deal of his native country. This indicates that although he is in America, not that much of America has yet entered into him. Inwardly, he still loves many things of his native country. In the same principle, we are in Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="316" id="316">[316]</span> absolutely, but He is in us just relatively and conditionally. Actually, according to our experience, we do not have very much of Christ in us. To a very large degree, we are still occupied and possessed by our culture. Although we may have been in the church life in the Lord’s recovery for many years, there is still room for much more of the church to be in us. The same is true with Christ. Although we may have been in Christ for a long time, in experience we still do not have very much of Him in us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="OLv1qDRjKPpb7WeQhnpjddP7lS7MWspE-1ppPPLq1fp8MR8MpzzfwWWMlwmSEija5">OCCUPIED BY CULTURE</h2><p data-content-id="4IBzwnFeZUmiPTldQylpqjfn87EuxLheAumWT0F5vBeYLZvZUxnAH8UtbPcg2OgXO"> We need a clear understanding of what it means to say that Christ is versus culture. Although Christ is in us, we are occupied more by culture than by Christ. We are filled with many things other than Christ. These things include our likes and dislikes, our preferences and choices, and our sin and worldliness. The more Christ as grace is ministered into us, the more those things which occupy us are discharged. However, although many sinful and worldly things may be discharged rather easily, our culture still remains, no matter how much grace is ministered into our being. </p>
<p data-content-id="omf13Bx02SFTK6-4sHpHdKgU2bmji8SgyrvnjZRmemRqzlC_dbZvNK2s_tofFhghm"> Anything that is in us apart from Christ Himself frustrates us from the genuine experience of Christ and enjoyment of Him. This is especially true of the culture within us. Through the years we have been in the church life, many things have been discharged from our being, as grace has been added into us. Nevertheless, one thing remains in us in a very subtle way, and that thing is culture. </p>
<p data-content-id="3UjYSiEHFuVk3dorn6OJHP8S2-tjG-zE1JDXU4fE-zxmVMphWG74zhUcdZ0bQV1Uw"> It is difficult to discern the culture in us and to condemn it. Because we do not recognize our culture for what it is, we do not easily discern it. Although we may condemn the sinful and worldly elements in us, we probably do not condemn our culture. Our culture may be very strong, but we may not be conscious of it. We may even think that we are not under the influence of culture. But every living person has a culture.

The thought in this Epistle is deep. For this reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92993" data-verses="Colossians 1:1">chapters one and two</span> are difficult to memorize and recite. </p>
<p data-content-id="c33eAwsfVfXraWL3f3puOBKwtcKxVtNqYFcEXib3Lo6hB_NVq0ahbWwl2qspOIzbJ"> As we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92994" data-verses="Colossians 1:1">chapter one</span>, we must pay close attention to Paul’s terminology. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92995" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">verse 12</span> he says that the Father has qualified us “for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.” In what way has the Father qualified us for this? According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92996" data-verses="Colossians 1:13">1:13</span>, He did this by delivering us out of the authority of darkness and transferring us into the kingdom of the Son of His love. </p>
<p data-content-id="YHo9_4F4rbtTN6uJrNVKlcVHfZpwc-UIM1JeaWPCErK8lD8OYCz-gEq8DCxiWamqp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92997" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">1:15</span> Paul goes on to say that Christ is the image of the invisible God, firstborn of all creation. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="92998" data-verses="Colossians 1:16-17">verses 16 and 17</span>, all things were created in Him, through Him, and unto Him, and all things subsist together in Him. Furthermore, as the firstborn from among the dead, He is the Head of the Body, the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="92999" data-verses="Colossians 1:18">v. 18</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93000" data-verses="Colossians 1:19">verse 19</span> Paul tells us that all the fullness was pleased to dwell in Him. The word “fullness” here denotes a living person, not a thing, for an impersonal substance or thing cannot be pleased about something. This fullness was pleased to dwell in Christ, in the all-inclusive One who has reconciled all things to Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93001" data-verses="Colossians 1:20">v. 20</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Ekj8KtyS_lkUZoS96keszutDh0I6LkQcNJn28_oNc3vFOaI1hUNqhE5B4RkV_HSQJ">GOD’S ECONOMY</h2><p data-content-id="DoDlSswZom_4i2OTnuzO3QHEH6MZ_AJ-vevsKnj9CyhxI_r5snfUvFBDoS7HJ6EHS"> Beginning with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93002" data-verses="Colossians 1:24">verse 24</span>, Paul goes on to speak of God’s economy. What is God’s economy? We may have been Christians for years without knowing what God’s economy is, or <span class="pg" data-page-id="322" id="322">[322]</span> without even asking Him to reveal His economy to us. God’s economy is related to the dispensing of Himself into us; however, it involves even more. The Greek word for economy, <em>oikonomia,</em> implies the thought of arrangement or administration. Hence, God’s economy is an administrative arrangement. In some places, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93003" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">1:25</span>, the Greek word is best rendered “stewardship.” God’s economy is His administrative arrangement, His stewardship, to dispense His riches into us. Just as wealthy families have an arrangement to distribute the wealth of the family to its members, so God has an arrangement in His economy to dispense His wealth into His children. Praise the Lord that we are members of God’s household! God’s economy is to dispense the unsearchable riches of Christ into all those chosen by God that they might become His children and members of the universal, divine family. As children of God, we are under His administrative arrangement by which He works Himself into our being. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="LGGjP-PAOdJ8nFxUYQbpLuUq0CcMQuyhMQZw72ekAlg3c478l-zKR4IjWE4Bf53rA">THE GOAL OF GOD’S DISPENSATION</h2><p data-content-id="mLlsVgAIb-skAhfjqngkuMQK38BuoDw-Eh0Y8vVQpH3WrdTCEmNX27ibG0XFE_F6p"> The goal of God’s dispensation of Himself into us is the one new man. The ultimate consummation of the new man will be the New Jerusalem. Today the new man is a miniature of the eternal New Jerusalem. The difference is not in nature or essence, but only in size or degree. Today we enjoy the new man as the issue, the result, of God’s economy. But in eternity we shall enjoy the New Jerusalem as the ultimate issue of God’s dispensing of Himself into us. It is necessary for all of us in the Lord’s recovery to know God’s economy in this way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZIaYAIUhlPYkrS-W4qNUAjewWfO-Mf35Enf7GKa9aNGLCeSPPJyL_qRbhaKXPVpri">THE GROWTH OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="A9Ho75-1IEWiI5pZAWtoolFIBGaNq_gDjip1OYh6Z3Q5wGMSc15rgkFYdiHX9QQ7d"> My burden in this message is to point out that the fulfillment of God’s economy does not depend on our effort. Rather, it depends on the growth of life. The focal point of God’s economy is not our doing; it is life growing. Hence, it is crucial for us to see what it means to grow and how to grow. <span class="pg" data-page-id="323" id="323">[323]</span> God does not need our doing. Anything that we do in ourselves means nothing. However, God wants us to grow. </p>
<p data-content-id="F8T5SrvVvSK9adYDT1faMIT2tKEYTdOvvK68nXJGmPygBYfXAuqVH6_7nXxzbpNoL"> In order for something to grow, it must, of course, have life. A table cannot grow, because it does not have life. However, a plant will grow because it is full of life. For example, my wife planted a tomato plant in our backyard. I am amazed how much this plant has grown and how many tomatoes it has produced. Because that tomato plant grew so much, there was the need of stakes to support it and to direct its growth. There was the need for an economy to manage this tomato plant. </p>
<p data-content-id="CV0IHBXEspCOWkPgBxpK-FPjvTa4Kv12YOitnjJYe71lPdJfo-RTTzkzgsHXnVKBu"> I would remind you that after God created man, He put him into a garden, a place of growth. God did not put man into a school, where he could be educated, or into a factory, where he could manufacture things, but into a garden, a place where life could grow. Our need today in the church is for growth, and in order to grow we must have life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="P48e1Zv0yLRjkEdD3vDxRlw0vzdxDASsNs7_pSaWHLCXEoMkdyKlIfpN-GyxhQQiF">THE HIGHEST REVELATION OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="-8P5_We9HlrZyO3mbt2-Dnw28FRjn2ZMPtZfEzTH8mFI2NJZdM2qdWpYHt1XsAb0_"> Now we come to a crucial question: What is our life? Probably we all would answer this question by saying that our life is Christ. What, then, is Christ? The life that grows in the church and which is needed for the growth of the church is Christ. But what is this Christ? The answer to this question is found in Colossians. According to this book, Christ is the fullness of God, the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, the firstborn from among the dead, the One in whom all the fullness is pleased to dwell, the mystery of God’s economy, the mystery of God, the reality of all positive things, and the constituent of the new man. For years we have pointed out that Christ is life, but perhaps we have not adequately paid our attention to what Christ is. In short, the Christ who is our life is everything, the reality of every positive thing in the universe. This is the revelation in the book of Colossians. </p>
<p data-content-id="piRKMgn5tqXQZ3-2TvISTCkGLtA07T5jTePG4ht9Tcd7P32I3OUf8n-_v44p36SzH"> Colossians contains the highest revelation of Christ in the New Testament. No other book tells us that Christ is the firstborn of all creation or that He is the mystery of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="324" id="324">[324]</span> Colossians reveals that Christ is the mystery of God’s economy and the mystery of God Himself. According to this book, Christ is everything to us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vIx9uQjmeEwOiVEgDgH8y0xEYdw03PyCYgINrThFa0OoCG1Z0wmuhOJ40BCNUJHpK">LIVING BY CHRIST, NOT BY CULTURE</h2><p data-content-id="W0UKyOT0t1IBxSIccUYMsUMOmTLZ0dfJmT-k52DOjH1qiyrn6ODlKeTuGk-ooeEF4"> If we see that Christ is everything, we shall spontaneously realize that we are nothing and nobody. In the words of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93004" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>, we have been crucified with Christ and Christ lives in us. He is the One who is patient, kind, loving, and full of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="2KhgJ0DuKwQnI2lO6O2N5dgXtc7pZhNkMP3qeHnY675TwiRdcLBNxgl-yEWidZOr3"> However, instead of living Christ, many of us unconsciously strive to improve ourselves. For example, a young brother who is about to get married may make up his mind to be an ideal husband. To do this is to live either according to our self-made culture or according to the culture we have inherited. Sometimes in conferences saints may testify that after that conference they will never be the same. Because such a statement is according to culture, a few days after the conference that person is the same as before. How easy it is to impose a cultural standard on ourselves! </p>
<p data-content-id="uei5QW3MGv90tAA2FxD3LJZfZPn-G4x75QFjeBrVrSzVrCFjdoepppbzqxBliOuF8"> The culture we impose on ourselves is actually a form of asceticism. Suppose a certain brother finds his wife difficult to bear, even though she is a dear sister in the Lord. This brother vows that, whatever the cost, he will be a good husband to his wife. He will bear with her, even if it is with gnashing of his teeth. This brother is living according to asceticism. Every time we make a decision to improve or to be different, we are living according to culture instead of according to Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="f5FHReDvsyzvBMFzyvsIslz0RMllPYKgmUB6rb4-E6X-5JRriI2ZE461KcHMoNa9f"> God’s intention is to dispense Christ into us so that He may be our life and our everything. God wants Christ to be our righteousness, holiness, humility, and patience. Since Christ is everything, there is no need for us to decide to do anything or to be anything. Instead, we should simply turn to the Lord and say, “Lord, thank You. You are my life and my everything. You are the real God and the real man. When I need love, You are love. When I need humility, You, Lord, are humility. Whatever I need, You are.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="325" id="325">[325]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Ij7bPPSnYgJ7k5YLk7p3WF7OHtk4-iCspqhi6sQh09yxxcsmTBisNQ0qrwyEIQciJ"> God does not want us to try to be good husbands or wives, parents or children. God only wants one person—Christ. However, we should not preach this to our children prematurely. Instead, we should first preach to ourselves, telling ourselves that God does not want our self-improvement, but that He only wants Christ. He has dispensed Christ into us to be our life and our everything so that we may live Him and that He may dwell in us. There is no need for us to strive to be loving. Our love is limited. But Christ is love, unlimited love, and He lives in us. </p>

Although, as a man, He was a perfect and complete individual person with a life of His own, He lived by the life of the Father, not by His human life. Since the Father’s life is divine and eternal, the Lord Jesus lived by the divine life. He and the Father had one life and one living. The Son lived by the Father’s life because the Son’s intention was to express the Father. Since the Son is the image, the expression, of the Father, and since He lived by the Father, the Son expresses the Father in a full way. The Son lives, but it is the Father who is expressed. </p>
<p data-content-id="h3ZNAj-7-mNpWfPCijhB17Zq-OLLOBqT5I-hwnsewSx8Ec6pwTMhh2r5WyeY8HZbS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93014" data-verses="John 6:57">John 6:57</span> the Lord Jesus said clearly that the living Father sent Him and that He lived because of the Father. The Father sent the Son, and the Son lived on earth through, because of, or by, the Father. I prefer to say simply that the Son lived the Father, for the Father was the Son’s life. </p>
<p data-content-id="U-smkr1a6dFJm6oEW-7auOkFl83XYaVwUVyMfwU3YgBr5P5j6Up1AlI-ogYff8uiJ"> The Bible reveals that the Son is a seed who is to be reproduced in the believers. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93015" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>, the one grain of wheat needs to fall into the earth and die in order to produce many grains in resurrection. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He lived the Father’s life. Now, after His resurrection, He has become our life. He wants us to live His life, not our own natural life. As individuals, we all have our own life. But in His economy, God does not intend that we live our natural life; He intends that we live Christ. As Christ lived the Father, so we should live Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="330" id="330">[330]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MbvcrlXtA4GGPOZNOvDot4_k4J0Oxt4WsRhB1iUfY2NjrQ3EE-RVlAKh7NIKw-9kI">CULTURE VERSUS CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="Vehc_DxwcgXUMWVvg6ZqRxQAe_mkaasmilbKcMYbZp13kc_c_BsTJjIrnVSGak81f"> We have pointed out that Christ is versus our culture. Our self-made and self-imposed culture, as well as the culture we have inherited, may be excellent, but as long as it is not Christ Himself, it is a hindrance to our experience of Christ, to our enjoyment of Christ, and to our living by Christ. In order to see this clearly, we need a heavenly vision. If we try to drop our culture without seeing that Christ is our life and our everything, we shall succeed only in exchanging one kind of culture for another. To be uncultured is also to have a culture. Those who are cultured have a culture, and those who are uncultured also have a culture, although of a very different kind. If we realize this, we shall see that it is of no avail simply to decide to drop our culture. Apart from Christ, whatever we are and whatever we do is related to culture in some way. Every human being has culture. The culture may be developed or undeveloped, high or low, but it is nonetheless a culture. At the time the book of Colossians was written, the Greeks had their culture and the Jews had theirs. Throughout the thousands of years of history, every race and nationality has had its particular kind of culture. The crucial point here is that every kind of culture is versus Christ and that Christ is versus every kind of culture. Any culture, no matter what kind of culture it is, is versus Christ. Apart from Him, every human product and development is part of culture. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="4IBzwnFeZUmiPTldQylpqjfn84kuxJheAumWT0F5vBeYLZvZUxnAH8UtbPcg2OgXO">GOD’S INTENTION IN HIS ECONOMY</h2><p data-content-id="omf13Bx02SFTK6-4sHpHdKgU2YGji-SgyrvnjZRmemRqzlC_dbZvNK2s_tofFhghm"> We should not try in ourselves to do anything about the culture within us. What is of vital importance is that we see the vision of God’s economy. God’s economy is to work the living, all-inclusive Person of Christ into us. According to the revelation in the book of Colossians, Christ is the portion of the saints, the firstborn of all creation, the image of the invisible God, the Head of the Body, the firstborn from among the dead, the One in whom all the fullness is pleased to dwell, the mystery of God’s economy, the mystery of God, the reality of all positive things, and the constituent <span class="pg" data-page-id="331" id="331">[331]</span> of the new man. Christ is everything: He is life, light, power, might, strength, righteousness, holiness, kindness, and every other divine attribute and human virtue. Because Christ is everything to us, He is all-inclusive. God’s intention in His economy is to work this all-inclusive One into us. As the all-inclusive One, Christ has the highest attainments. He has ascended to the heavens and has been exalted to the highest place in the universe. He is now sitting at the right hand of God. Christ has been enthroned, and He has become the Lord and Head over all. Furthermore, He has obtained everything, for all things have become His. This Person with all He has attained and obtained is the very One that God desires to work into our being. Do you truly believe that such an all-inclusive living Person has been wrought into you? I doubt that very many Christians, including those in the Lord’s recovery, actually believe this. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3UjYSiEHFuVk3dorn6OJHP8S29NjF-TE1JDXU4fE-zxmVMphWG74zhUcdZ0bQV1Uw">THE NECESSITY OF CHRIST BEING OUR LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="GpAIfwI6Fm0o_bJAzhxAk04CSoNspFfbvl-wOzBXDm09fW-1mBX4cRfsZbOTdf_Bp"> The all-inclusive Christ is to be our life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93016" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">3:4</span>). If Christ does not become our life, then all He is and all He attained and obtained remain objective. He is He, and we are we. In that case He has nothing to do with us in a practical way, nor we with Him. Therefore, in our actual daily experience, Christ must be our life. However, we may have the doctrinal knowledge from the Bible that Christ is our life without living by Christ in a practical way day by day. Instead of living by Christ, we live too much of the time by our natural life. </p>
<p data-content-id="c33eAwsfVfXraWL3f3puOBKwtcaxS-tqYFcEXib3Lo6hB_NVq0ahbWwl2qspOIzbJ"> We all should be willing to admit that we love our own life, our natural human life. We may claim to hate our life, but actually we love it very much. Even as you testify of your hatred for your natural life, deep within, you still appreciate your life and consider it better than that of others. For example, deep within, a sister may feel that her life is better than her husband’s life. Of course, a brother will have similar feelings toward his wife. We all are alike in thinking highly of our natural life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="332" id="332">[332]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="YHo9_4F4rbtTN6uJrNVKlcVHfZ5watkIM1JeaWPCErK8lD8OYCz-gEq8DCxiWamqp">REFINING THE NATURAL LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="Ekj8KtyS_lkUZoS96keszutDh0Y6C3QcNJn28_oNc3vFOaI1hUNqhE5B4RkV_HSQJ"> In addition to appreciating our natural life, we all are in the habit of using it, that is, of living according to it. Over the years we have become accustomed to living by our own life. Moreover, we have even endeavored to refine the natural life. Through the training we have received at home, our natural life has been somewhat refined. It has been refined further through education and religion. We must admit that the natural life has even been refined by our participation in the local church. A brother who has been in the church for several years truly is much more refined than he was before coming into the church life. Some of the most refined people in this country are to be found in the church life. However, instead of carrying on such a refining work, the church should terminate and bury the natural life. But most of us have not been buried by the church; instead, we have been refined. Before you came into the church life, you may have been like unpolished copper. But now that you have been refined by the church life, you are like shiny, polished copper. Although polished copper may look like gold, it is not gold. Likewise, although our natural life may be refined and polished, it is still not Christ. In the churches, there is too much refined copper and too little gold. There is too much of the natural life and not that much of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="DoDlSswZom_4i2OTnuzO3QHEH6cZ3TZ-vevsKnj9CyhxI_r5snfUvFBDoS7HJ6EHS"> Christian preachers often give people the wrong kind of advice. They may be like doctors who prescribe the wrong medicine. In the early years of my ministry, I would tell those who were about to get married that they needed to be balanced and subdued. I told them that the Lord would use their husband or wife and their children to subdue them. I regret having given out that kind of teaching, for it leads to the refinement of the natural life, not to living by Christ. In my early ministry I could not clearly discern between gold and copper that had been refined and polished. Now I see that no matter how much copper is refined and polished, it will not become gold. In the same principle, refining our natural life will not transform it into Christ. What God desires <span class="pg" data-page-id="333" id="333">[333]</span> is that we live Christ. He has no intention merely to refine our human life. </p>

The Bible may be compared to Mount Zion, which has a number of peaks. The highest “peak” in the Bible is Colossians. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6lc_KG4lpSEXBWvOfF9n73K2DSNBmPqSbKVHRXhoCGalmrzef-H9gsKXflDUdQgSY">A COMPARISON</h2><p data-content-id="RfNO2lIzA5Rw54npqQTHNA_TOis6Y9wgvd8yXLZ0NJhLX6FOEZQflozxR78uf33Oy"> If we compare Colossians with the Gospel of John, we shall be helped to realize how high is the revelation in Colossians. Most of us appreciate the Gospel of John because it is a book of life. It is also a book of the mystery of life. Although the Gospel of John is mysterious, the revelation it contains cannot compare with the revelation in Colossians. John’s Gospel opens with the words, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93025" data-verses="John 1:18">1:18</span> John goes on to say, “No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.” Colossians does not tell us that the Word was God, but it does speak of Christ as “the image of the invisible God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93026" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">1:15</span>). Paul’s utterance and expression here are marvelous. Then, in apposition to this clause, Paul continues in the same verse by speaking of Christ as the “firstborn of all creation.” This indicates that the “firstborn of all creation” is synonymous with “the image of the invisible God.” This proves that the firstborn of all creation is the very image of the invisible God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="338" id="338">[338]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="sQ-jiCKNjXFon2Sit_5DdVXU8diLboqUaRJLlAaDAC4Gkuj3zqfMcEH9tudAOZTWi"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93027" data-verses="John 1:3">John 1:3</span> says, “All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being.” Compare this with Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93028" data-verses="Colossians 1:16">Colossians 1:16</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93029" data-verses="Colossians 1:17">17</span>: “Because in Him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and unto Him. And He is before all things, and all things subsist together in Him.” It is rather easy to recite <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93030" data-verses="John 1:3">John 1:3</span>, but it is difficult to recite <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93031" data-verses="Colossians 1:16-17">Colossians 1:16 and 17</span>, verses which are far more complicated. According to Colossians, the very Christ whom we have received as our Savior and our life is the image of the invisible God. Furthermore, the One who is the image of God is the firstborn of all creation because in Him, through Him, and unto Him all things have been created. Furthermore, we see from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93032" data-verses="Colossians 1:17">1:17</span> that Christ is before all things and that all things subsist together in Him. This word points to Christ’s eternal preexistence and to the fact that all things exist together by Christ as the holding center, just as the spokes of a wheel are held together by the hub at their center. Such a revelation as given in these verses is beyond our ability to understand fully. </p>
<p data-content-id="wrbcmMjVyCQkgWdRivfLA0DYptEMDq-d3uqzGEffBGQc6UVl06Y-KY2UHVu1-W7x4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93033" data-verses="Colossians 1:18">1:18</span> Paul goes on to say that Christ is the Head of the Body, the church, and that He is the beginning, the firstborn from among the dead. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93034" data-verses="Colossians 1:19">verse 19</span> we read, “For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell.” The fullness has more than one aspect. Therefore, Paul is careful to point out that all the fullness, the fullness with its various aspects, is pleased to dwell in Christ. The different aspects of the fullness include the fullness in the firstborn of all creation, the fullness in Christ’s being before all things, the fullness in creation’s being in Him, through Him, and unto Him, the fullness in being the firstborn from among the dead, and the fullness in His being the Head of the church. All this fullness was pleased not only to dwell in Christ, but also to reconcile all things to Himself. Where else can we find a revelation to compare with this? <span class="pg" data-page-id="339" id="339">[339]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="piRKMgn5tqXQZ3-2TvISTCkGMvA07R5jTePG4ht9Tcd7P32I3OUf8n-_v44p36SzH"> In contrast to the Gospel of John, Colossians does not use simple words, expressions, and sentences. The sentences in this Epistle are complicated and often include many phrases and clauses. In fact, all the verses from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93035" data-verses="Colossians 1:9-20">1:9 through 20</span> should be regarded as a single sentence. This is much different from the simple expressions in the Gospel of John: “I am the bread of life,” “I am the light,” “I am the door.” </p>

No doubt Colossians is part of the completion of God’s revelation through Paul. Without this Epistle, the divine revelation would not be complete. Because Colossians is part of the completion of the divine revelation, the revelation in this book is exceedingly high and rich. Because this revelation is so high and because Paul’s writing is complicated, not many Christians have a proper understanding of this book. We believe that now, at the close of this age, the Lord is opening this book for the sake of His purpose. </p>

Actually, this book reveals more concerning what Christ is than who He is. Most Christians, however, only know who Christ is; they have little knowledge of what He is. But if we would know the all-inclusive Christ, we must know what He is as well as who He is. It is easier to know who Christ is than to know what He is. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93038" data-verses="Colossians 1:1">Colossians 1</span> we see that Christ is the portion of the saints (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93039" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">v. 12</span>), the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, the Head of the Body, the beginning, the firstborn from among the dead, and the One in whom all the fullness was pleased to dwell. Is this fullness related to what Christ is or to who Christ is? It is <span class="pg" data-page-id="340" id="340">[340]</span> difficult to say. It seems, however, that Paul personified the fullness. This indicates that he considered the fullness a Person, for the fullness was pleased to dwell in Christ and to reconcile all things. These are the functions of a living Person, not of a thing. As we consider the aspects of Christ unfolded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93040" data-verses="Colossians 1:1">chapter one</span>, we find that some are related to who Christ is, whereas others are related to what He is. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="f5FHReDvsyzvBMFzyvsIslz0WOllMZqgmUB6rb4-E6X-5JRriI2ZE461KcHMoNa9f">THE GOAL OF THE SUBJECTIVE MINISTRY</h2><p data-content-id="Ij7bPPSnYgJ7k5YLk7p3WF7OAvk49iispqhi6sQh09yxxcsmTBisNQ0qrwyEIQciJ"> The revelation of Christ given thus far in Colossians is altogether objective. For example, Christ is objectively the image of God and the firstborn of all creation. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93041" data-verses="Colossians 1:24-29">verses 24 through 29</span> we have the stewardship, the economy, the dispensation, through which the objective Christ is dispensed into us. The Christ revealed objectively in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93042" data-verses="Colossians 1:15-19">verses 15 through 19</span> is ministered into us in a subjective way through the ministry of God’s steward in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93043" data-verses="Colossians 1:25-29">verses 25 through 29</span>. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93044" data-verses="Colossians 1:1">Colossians 1</span> we have both the objective revelation and the subjective ministry. The goal of the subjective ministry is to dispense the Christ of the objective revelation into us. If we had <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93045" data-verses="Colossians 1:15-19">verses 15 through 19</span> without <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93046" data-verses="Colossians 1:25-29">verses 25 through 29</span>, we would have only the objective revelation, not the subjective ministry. We need the subjective ministry in order for the all-inclusive Christ revealed objectively to be supplied to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="HJXSCv7FjRX11Nlg8l5j7efQi7XgOMZ6T3GdC5v5dCb9ChbHCNsZDKBUk5DL1WVtx"> The subjective ministry of the objective Christ is the completing of the word of God. Hence, the completing of God’s word is not mere doctrine; it is a matter of ministry. Through the subjective ministry, the objective Christ becomes the very Christ in us, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93047" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">verse 27</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93048" data-verses="Colossians 1:25-29">verses 25 through 29</span> Christ is no longer merely objective, for He is now the subjective Christ dwelling in us to be our hope of glory. He has become subjective because He has been dispensed into us through the ministry of the steward. Now the objective Christ has become the subjective Christ, the Christ living in us. </p>

<p data-content-id="P48e1Zv0yLRjkEdD3vDxRlw0oxNxETSsNs7_pSaWHLCXEoMkdyKlIfpN-GyxhQQiF"> The book of Colossians reveals Christ in a very extensive way. This extensive revelation is much greater than all that most Christians have seen of Christ. Christians realize that Christ is God and that He became a man, lived on earth, died on the cross for our sins as our Redeemer, was buried, was resurrected on the third day, ascended to heaven, and has been enthroned as the Lord and Head of all. Now Christ is the sovereign Lord of lords and King of kings. One day He will come back to rule over the earth and to set up His kingdom. A great many books have been written concerning all these points. Of course, such a general revelation of Christ is true, but it is narrow. It does not match the extensive revelation of Christ found in Colossians. </p>
<p data-content-id="-8P5_We9HlrZyO3mbt2-Dnw27HBjhlJMPtZfEzTH8mFI2NJZdM2qdWpYHt1XsAb0_"> According to the Bible, Christ is extensive, and the revelation of Christ is also extensive. Like the universe, Christ is immeasurable. For this reason, the revelation regarding Christ is without limit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93074" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span> Paul speaks of the breadth, length, height, and depth. Christ is the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe. Since He is so extensive, how could we be content with a narrow revelation of Him? We are foolish if we limit ourselves to a narrow revelation of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="piRKMgn5tqXQZ3-2TvISTCkGMvQ0yDZjTePG4ht9Tcd7P32I3OUf8n-_v44p36SzH"> Certain people have advised me not to go beyond the general theology of today’s Christianity. They recommend that I simply preach and teach in a general way. More than thirty <span class="pg" data-page-id="350" id="350">[350]</span> years ago, I saw that Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and I was burdened to minister this to others. Some intimate friends were offended and began to warn me in love and eventually to oppose me. Some admitted that the Bible reveals that Christ is the Spirit. Nevertheless, they told me that I should not teach this, in order to keep from offending other Christians. I replied, “Since you admit that the Bible reveals that Christ is the Spirit, please give me the liberty to minister on this matter. You may be afraid of Christianity, but I am not. If Martin Luther had maintained an attitude like yours, how could the Reformation have taken place? The Catholic Church held the concept of salvation by works. Luther, however, saw that salvation is not by works, but by faith. And he was bold to declare this according to the Bible.” </p>
<p data-content-id="vIx9uQjmeEwOiVEgDgH8y0xEffg0_fCCYgINrThFa0OoCG1Z0wmuhOJ40BCNUJHpK"> We should not be held back by the narrow view of Christ held by many Christians. Christ is exceedingly extensive; He is unlimited. The Bible even speaks of “the unsearchable riches of Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93075" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Eph. 3:8</span>). Although Christ’s riches are unsearchable, many Christians limit Him by their theology and teachings. They have only an elementary understanding of Him. Christ, the Savior in whom we believe, is not limited. He is inexhaustible, all-inclusive, limitless. No one can say how great He is. Since He is without limitation, the revelation concerning Him must also be without limit. In this matter the book of Colossians is crucial. Without this book, it would be difficult to realize that the revelation of Christ is unlimited and extensive. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sr4B7OdLi_gaxbmxLXiEYa2SU36IHrPLZGWdu23POQDxs7Xqf3z_YUMIa59gSQKwD"> In 1970 some opposing ones in Hong Kong rose up to declare that the Christ in whom we believe is the Creator, but to deny that He is also a creature. They were confident that they were right, and they condemned us for saying that Christ is both the Creator and the first among the creatures. I asked them how Christ could be a man if He were not a creature. Is man not a creature? If Christ were not a creature, how could He have a body of flesh and blood? How could He have been nailed to the cross if He were only the divine, spiritual Creator? It is very dangerous to have just a <span class="pg" data-page-id="351" id="351">[351]</span> little knowledge. It keeps us from seeing the extensive revelation of Christ in the Scriptures. One reason the book of Colossians was written was to present such an extensive revelation of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ggDaF55GyBbxJPqPBphLCbZafORKd0QCTqIDR3goq-SVfvSN8prg0TR811vkyUmRZ">THE CHURCH INVADED BY CULTURE</h2><p data-content-id="ebF32ctwP_e7REaxpIcbMtYbbpofL9MLDYsGl3bv4T3pP5hTy7t2LO_iBZ3Z1dSVZ"> When the book of Colossians was written, Asia Minor was a cultural melting pot. In Asia Minor there was a blending of Greek culture and Jewish culture, in particular of Greek philosophy and Jewish religion. Through Paul’s ministry, churches had been established in that region. It was very difficult for these churches to withstand the invasion of Jewish religion and Greek philosophy. The church in Colosse was like an island in the ocean of Jewish and Greek culture. Eventually, the cultural tide swept into the church and pervaded the church life. Hence, the church was permeated with Jewish concepts and Greek philosophical ideas. In particular, a form of Gnosticism was brought into the church life. According to Gnosticism, material things are intrinsically evil. There were various regulations concerning the handling of material things. Because the church in Colosse was pervaded by such philosophical ideas, Christ was replaced, and the saints did not live by Him. Instead, they lived by their philosophical concepts. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5znjdl0RibbATJcKH_ecb09_mdRFvEAnNfuxNd8ItWQaf-xO-QYNQQKXpfnLolJRo">ALL THINGS CREATED IN CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="NvL9nhfr9y1MfkuCnJjWc5-mHmgZRIH-02hvDSNt9dQdENu8DeMorULDAd59B1LCF"> To confront the Gnostic concept that matter is evil, Paul put forth a most extensive revelation of Christ. Whereas the Gnostics claim that material things are inherently evil, Paul pointed out that all things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ and that they are now subsisting in Christ. Paul was bold, and his teaching meant the death of Gnostic philosophy. He boldly pointed out that all things, including animals and reptiles regarded by Jews as unclean, were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ. Furthermore, all these things are now subsisting in Christ. What a shock this must have been to the Jewish mentality, which had been trained to distinguish <span class="pg" data-page-id="352" id="352">[352]</span> the clean from the unclean. Remember Peter’s reaction to the vision that he saw in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93076" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span>. When Peter saw the sheet containing all manner of wild beasts and creeping things and heard the voice telling him to kill and eat, he said, “Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.” Nevertheless, according to Paul’s word in Colossians, all these things were created unto Christ and subsist in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="t5iqp8-G4gD5mGLTCIR_DHqa-SMd6sluKEbpWrQpW1yZ_muRMBVOIaTGcMROMFrnI"> Many scientists recognize that in the universe there is some kind of power that holds all things together. This holding power, which is the hub, the center, of the universe, is Christ. Because Christ is this holding power, all things, including snakes, scorpions, and frogs, subsist in Christ. Without Christ, the universe and everything in it would collapse. We are upheld, not by the earth, but by Christ. Our existence is maintained by Christ in whom all things are held together. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="h3ZNAj-7-mNpWfPCijhB17Zq5MLLJSqT5I-hwnsewSx8Ec6pwTMhh2r5WyeY8HZbS">ROOM ONLY FOR CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="U-smkr1a6dFJm6oEW-7auOkFi-3XeJFwUVyMfwU3YgBr5P5j6Up1AlI-ogYff8uiJ"> Paul presented such an extensive revelation of Christ in order to help the saints to be free from their cultural concepts. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93077" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span>, in the eyes of God there is no difference between animals and reptiles that are clean and those that are unclean. In his reluctance to obey the voice to kill and eat, Peter was still acting according to his cultural preference. Such preferences cause us to be divisive and make it impossible for us to realize the one new man. In the new man there is no room for Jew or Greek, for circumcision or uncircumcision. There is no room for barbarian or Scythian. In the new man, all the room is for Christ. Christ is all and in all. This means that Christ is every part of the new man and is in every part. The goal of this extensive revelation of Christ is that we would all live Christ. If we live Christ, it will make no difference what kind of food we are served. We would not say, when visiting certain places, that because we are Christians we cannot eat certain things. Such preferences are apart from the living of the new man. <span class="pg" data-page-id="353" id="353">[353]</span> </p>

Some of these phrases are “Christ in you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93095" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">1:27</span>), “full-grown in Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93096" data-verses="Colossians 1:28">1:28</span>), “walk in Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93097" data-verses="Colossians 2:6">2:6</span>), “according to Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93098" data-verses="Colossians 2:8">2:8</span>), “made alive together with Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93099" data-verses="Colossians 2:13">2:13</span>), “died with Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93100" data-verses="Colossians 2:20">2:20</span>), “holding the Head” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93101" data-verses="Colossians 2:19">2:19</span>), “out from whom” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93102" data-verses="Colossians 2:19">2:19</span>), and “grows with the growth of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93103" data-verses="Colossians 2:19">2:19</span>). These nine expressions give us a complete picture of the proper experience of Christ. In this regard, we need to pay special attention to the prepositions in, according to, with, and out from. Furthermore, it would be a great help to pray-read all the verses related to these points. </p>
<p data-content-id="XqFwK4-uCOxRvgyEbG31TFRJbAngJjVv26KaLLx9rvafbSffqSmEd1W12EaU8vYF3"> In addition to all these positive points, Paul gives the Colossians some negative points, in particular, four warnings. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93104" data-verses="Colossians 2:4">2:4</span> he says, “This I say that no one may delude you with persuasive speech.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93105" data-verses="Colossians 2:8">2:8</span> Paul issues this warning: “Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.” The third warning is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93106" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">2:16</span>, where Paul says, “Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths.” Finally, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93107" data-verses="Colossians 2:18">2:18</span> Paul says, “Let no one purposely defraud you of your prize, in humility and worship of the angels, standing on things which he has seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh.” Notice that in each of these verses Paul uses the words “no one.” If we would have the real experience of Christ, we must take heed to all these warnings and beware <span class="pg" data-page-id="360" id="360">[360]</span> that no one delude us, carry us off, judge us, or defraud us of our prize. </p>

The Christ who is in us is the extensive, immeasurable, unsearchable One. How marvelous that such a Christ dwells in us! We need to become full-grown in such a Christ, to walk in Him, and to be according to Him. Having died with Christ and having been made alive with Him, we should hold Him as the Head out from whom the whole Body grows with the growth of God. All these matters indicate that Christ is near, available, and applicable. Otherwise, how could Christ be in us, and how could we be full-grown in Him? Unless Christ were applicable, we could not walk in Him, be according to Him, or die and be made alive together with Him. Neither could we hold Him as the Head out from whom the Body grows with the growth of God. All these points are related to the subjective experience of Christ. Furthermore, these points are neglected or altogether lacking among today’s Christians, where there is little emphasis on walking in Christ, being according to Christ, or holding Christ as the Head. </p>

None of the other positive points of the experience of Christ covered in Colossians could be our experience. What other person is capable of being in us and of making it possible for us to die with Him, to live in Him, and to walk according to Him? The unique person qualified for all these nine points is the Spirit. This term, <em>the Spirit,</em> is of tremendous significance. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93109" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span> says, “But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believe in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” Although the Spirit of God was in existence, <em>the Spirit</em> was not yet because Jesus had not yet been glorified. In the <span class="pg" data-page-id="361" id="361">[361]</span> Epistles the term <em>the Spirit</em> is used frequently. It denotes the processed all-inclusive Triune God. Ultimately, the Triune God reaches us as <em>the Spirit.</em> </p>
<p data-content-id="kX1nUfZuqQkzrLrgt3NFkih8jARwQ3eJ9RDPm9pQmA9VJDK3iAAZbqak9qWDfH_Sw"> To reach us the Triune God had to pass through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. By incarnation God came into man. Then for thirty-three and a half years the Lord lived on earth as a man. Jesus, the embodiment of the Triune God, lived for years in the house of a poor carpenter. Imagine, the almighty, infinite God living day by day in a carpenter’s home! Eventually, the Lord Jesus was put to death. But on the third day, having passed through death, conquering and subduing it, He came out of death and entered into resurrection. By incarnation, divinity was brought into humanity. But by resurrection humanity was brought into divinity. Through incarnation God was brought into man, and through Christ’s resurrection man was brought into God. Through Christ’s resurrection, the Triune God, mingled with man, became the Spirit. This Spirit includes God, incarnation, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Redeemed and uplifted humanity is in this Spirit. The all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is the Triune God reaching us in a final and ultimate way. This is the Spirit. Furthermore, the very Christ today is this Spirit. Therefore, it is easy for Christ to be in us and for us to be in Him. It is also possible for us to become full-grown in Him, to walk in Him, and to be according to Him. </p>

Consider the air in the atmosphere as an illustration. We are in the air, and the air is in us. Both are necessary if we are to remain alive. Today the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is our air. This air is in us, and we are in this air and even walk in this air. Moreover, we can be people according to this air who grow in this air with the growth of God. The all-inclusive Christ is, therefore, the experiential Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="362" id="362">[362]</span> He is a Christ who can be in us, and a Christ in whom we can walk.

We should not be according to philosophy, ethics, culture, or religion. We should not in any way be according to the old man. Rather, we are here to be according to the processed, all-inclusive life-giving Triune God. This, however, should not be a mere doctrine. For example, a brother should not deal with his wife according to culture; he should deal with her according to Christ, according to the processed Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="qcLWvpSjI1XL62hLozF8aNmkaesb7AaDsla5rdBghIZYVZKEAFjA56Gig5TWSCGAX"> If we would live, behave, and have our being according to the all-inclusive, life-giving, processed Triune God, we would all be like Paul the apostle. Paul became a person who was not according to his forefathers, the law, tradition, Judaism, or the teaching of Gamaliel. He became a person who was absolutely according to the processed Triune God. His Epistles were written not according to anything other than the all-inclusive, life-giving, processed Triune God. How different are Paul’s writings from today’s Christian writings! </p>
<p data-content-id="yrS9bX0cFSGgVgun4Ufhw1Icgdrv8jeF1ONqnoyndBoPJWI5e-rH93nABe6-78JSB"> Our daily walk should be according to the processed Triune God. For example, when a brother gets a haircut, he should do so not according to any particular standard, but according to the processed Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="8W3SYV3ote4j4Rg0nTLNGDsaYWLYGlmEc9qelKbjNksm4WKd2cErScxTa7rBwQTLq"> Do you know where the all-inclusive, life-giving, processed Triune God is today? He is in our spirit. In our spirit He is the all-inclusive One, the life-giving One. In our spirit He is the processed Triune God. If we live according to the processed Triune God in our spirit, every type of culture will be gone. Only the all-inclusive life-giving Triune God will remain. The Christian life and the church life are without culture, but according to the processed Triune God. If we live according to the processed Triune God, there will be no <span class="pg" data-page-id="363" id="363">[363]</span> need for us to try to drop our culture. Culture will be gone automatically. </p>

They would say, “Isn’t God eternal, infinite, almighty, and unchanging? How can the eternal, infinite God be processed?” Instead of arguing with people about this point, we should simply present the facts from the Word of God. The Bible reveals that one day God became flesh. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93125" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> says that the Word became flesh. Does this not point to a process? If there were no process involved with the incarnation, how could the eternal, infinite God have become a finite man? After thirty-three and a half years, this processed One went to the cross and was crucified. Some may be amazed to hear that it was God who was crucified. However, we need to remember that the One who was <span class="pg" data-page-id="368" id="368">[368]</span> crucified was God incarnate. After His crucifixion, Christ was buried. Then He passed through death and came forth in resurrection. Was that not also part of a process? Christ was buried with a physical body like ours. But when He came out of the tomb in resurrection, He had a spiritual body. His physical body had been transfigured into a spiritual one. Certainly this indicates a process. Therefore, we can say with assurance that our God has been processed. He was processed through incarnation to become a man, and then He was processed through resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93126" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>). </p>

The name of God here is Father-Son-Spirit. Due to the poverty of our language, we may be forced to use the term “person” in speaking of the Father, Son, and Spirit, referring to Them as the three Persons of the Trinity.

In baptism, we are immersed in the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit. However, many Christians argue about the method of baptism or about the kind of water used, yet they have little or no comprehension of the spiritual reality symbolized by the water. Because our relationship with the Lord is mysterious and spiritual, the Bible uses the physical symbol of baptism to signify our union with the Triune God. Being immersed in the water of baptism signifies that a believer is being put into the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="nAAjrYoSxORsKcXED0Y92nk_iO28eDLYu242cBU-V2b50Voz0s71JJrl7esVgPqMx"> The name in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93134" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> denotes the sum total of the divine Being. Hence, the name is equivalent to the person. To be put into the name is to be put into the person. To baptize a believer into the name of the Triune God is to immerse him into all that God is. To have the name is to have the person. To baptize people into the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit is to baptize them into a wonderful Person. The water used in baptism signifies the wonderful Person of the Triune God. Whenever we baptize people, we should tell them that the water into which we immerse them symbolizes the Triune God. When we immerse them into the water, we are actually putting them into the Triune God. </p>

Acknowledging that we respected the Bible and baptized people in water, he asked me in what name we baptize the believers. Was it in the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit, in the name of Christ Jesus, or in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ? He went on to say that the name makes a great difference. I asked him to explain the difference between Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93139" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Galatians 3:27</span> and the Father, Son, and Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93140" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>. He replied that Christ is merely the Son. Then I went on to say that instead of arguing, we should simply enjoy the Father, Son, and Spirit, Christ Jesus, and the Lord Jesus Christ. I said that Christ is all-inclusive, that He is not only the Son, but also the Father and the Spirit. I also told him that we may baptize one person into the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit; another, into Christ; and still another, into the Lord Jesus Christ or into Christ Jesus. There is nothing wrong with baptizing people in this way. When we compare <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93141" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93142" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Galatians 3:27</span>, we see that to baptize people into Christ is to baptize them into the Father, Son, and Spirit. We do not care to argue over terminology; we care only for the living Person, for the all-inclusive, life-imparting, processed Triune God. </p>

Our entrance into Christ is related to life and to the growth of life. We do not enter into Christ in the same way that we walk into a room. Walking into a room has nothing to do with either life or growth. However, entering into Christ involves the process of growth. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93163" data-verses="Romans 6:5">Romans 6:5</span> Paul says that “we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death.” Now we are growing with Christ in the likeness of His resurrection. </p>

Baptism is not a lifeless ritual; it is an experience that is very much related to life and growth. Whenever we baptize believers, we should help them realize that in baptism they will grow together with Christ, because they have been grafted into the crucified and resurrected Christ. Christ’s crucifixion provided an opening in Him for us to be grafted into Him, and His resurrection ushers us into the process of growth. Now that we have been grafted into Christ, we should grow in Him day by day. </p>
<p data-content-id="3UjYSiEHFuVk3dorn6OJHP8Sx-djMsTE1JDXU4fE-zxmVMphWG74zhUcdZ0bQV1Uw"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93164" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span> Paul also speaks of growth. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93165" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">verse 9</span> he points out that the believers are God’s farm. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93166" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:6">verse 6</span> he says, “I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the growth” (Gk.). This implies that the saints are plants in God’s farm. In the church, God’s farm, we are plants growing. <span class="pg" data-page-id="378" id="378">[378]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="GpAIfwI6Fm0o_bJAzhxAk04CVrdshXPbvl-wOzBXDm09fW-1mBX4cRfsZbOTdf_Bp"> The concept of growing like plants is also found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93167" data-verses="Romans 11:1">Romans 11</span>, where Paul uses the illustration of grafting a branch from a wild olive tree into a cultivated olive tree. In the eyes of God, we all are plants, or trees. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93168" data-verses="Romans 6:5">Romans 6:5</span> Paul uses a particular Greek word to indicate growth. It is very difficult to find an English equivalent for this word, which means to grow by being planted or grafted. Both planting and grafting are for growth. A tree is planted in the soil so that it may grow. Likewise, the purpose of grafting is growth. Recently, a brother pointed out a marvelous definition of this Greek word found in <em>Commentary on Romans</em> by Frederick Louis Godet. According to Godet (p. 243), the word denotes “the organic union in virtue of which one being shares the life, growth, and phases of existence belonging to another.” Through the organic union of two plants, accomplished by grafting, the one plant partakes of the life and characteristics of the other plant. What a wonderful way of growth! Applying this definition to our spiritual experience, we may say that we have been grafted into the “tree” of the all-inclusive, life-giving, processed Triune God, who is the all-inclusive Spirit. Having become one with Him through grafting, we now partake of the life and characteristics of this all-inclusive One, and in this way we grow. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8W3SYV3ote4j4Rg0nTLNGDsaYXrYGnmEc9qelKbjNksm4WKd2cErScxTa7rBwQTLq">ROOTED IN THE LIVING LAND</h2><p data-content-id="0dvJwNTlnFFL7ZQjBM_mXPhF5irx0TI_QdjxYstvjmR9qWy9nTfOsrOtXWOoopoj0"> In the book of Colossians there are implications that believers are to grow like plants rooted in the soil. In order to understand the Bible, we need to understand both the direct meaning of the words and also the implications. Sometimes the revelation expressed through the implications of a verse is deeper than that conveyed in the direct statements. This is true of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93169" data-verses="Colossians 2:6-7">Colossians 2:6 and 7</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93170" data-verses="Colossians 2:7">Verse 7</span> speaks of our “having been rooted” in Christ. This implies that, in God’s eyes, we are plants. Those who have been baptized into Christ are plants rooted in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="7cuojx9EnikxgkGvSa0_PvMZKkB3cNE5yo0N_UaqITA8UbezEJgBcuGWFgD9_1aau"> The phrase “having been rooted and being built up in Him” is related to those who are walking in the preceding <span class="pg" data-page-id="379" id="379">[379]</span> verse. We are to walk in Christ, having been rooted and being built up in Him. This means that we are to walk by having been rooted in Christ. If we have not been rooted in Him, we cannot walk in Him. As living plants, we are walking plants. We walk by being rooted in Christ. What wonderful, mysterious plants Christians are! We are plants who both walk and grow. </p>
<p data-content-id="_0z4CjgcRAzGySPl6nQ9kckrX9ciI1FLuxfmejJOVBUIS_-qK7UtCn7ND1Qwyrk2f"> Some may think that it is not logical to say, on the one hand, that we can be rooted and, on the other hand, that we walk. How can one who has been rooted in Christ also walk in Him? The answer is that the land in which we are rooted is a living land. Since we have been rooted in a living, moving land, we live and move in Him. Hence, it is not actually that we do the walking, but it is the land which moves. Praise the Lord that we are rooted in Christ who is the living land! Because the land moves, we can move also. According to the implication of these verses, it is proper to speak in this way. </p>
<p data-content-id="BOCvS1r-7tIB54EhOvqqTqjpzr0q6bpvx43xAqzzl996JaIsWLw395nl-aNWe_mB3"> We should not think that we are the ones walking in the land. If we try to walk, we shall stumble and fall. Then we may be defeated by Satan and led astray. We should regard ourselves as plants rooted in Christ as our living land. As those who have been rooted in Him, we walk as He moves. This is to walk in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="xhOwCJPMz8poSokM7QjIveWcTVFv-UtC3D97biFQx_aZezgsPp4uXJaG_Tl_jpc6R"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93171" data-verses="Colossians 2:6">Colossians 2:6</span> says to walk <em>in</em> Him. This adverbial phrase modifies the word walk. It indicates that we cannot walk in Christ unless we have been rooted in Him. Thus, we walk in the living land in which we have been rooted. </p>
<p data-content-id="riqDpjchUDoSOoMli_WZl-IiwrcFEPNu7gQhs2g1WdrF9hCb4rF0iMESoWGxdqC3t"> As we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93172" data-verses="Colossians 2:6-7">2:6 and 7</span>, we see that to grow in Christ is to walk in Him. We have pointed out that “having been rooted and being built up in Him” is related to the word walk. This phrase gives us the meaning of walking in Christ. Because we have been rooted in the moving Christ, we walk in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="d9yHx1EHlCF0Nc2ISA4iR70qAYkB08jQsAr0x-_n5uKwoGhkDJWrhSt-NWfOCM6YO"> The fact that walking in Christ is a matter of growing is indicated by the word rooted. Plants are rooted in the soil for the purpose of growth. If a tree is to grow, it must be properly rooted. Without roots, a tree will die, for it has no way <span class="pg" data-page-id="380" id="380">[380]</span> to absorb moisture from the soil. A tree is able to grow, however, when it absorbs moisture through its roots. </p>
<p data-content-id="QoYPkMNcmTS0w0HcQG2WFMBh8jpNjcno00ymhHKS1B0KuZrfvJx-ndqeKB8A9ADgi"> Although the rooting is for the growing, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93173" data-verses="Colossians 2:6">2:6</span> does not speak of growing, but of walking in Christ. However, the implied significance of these terms is that genuine growth consists of our walking in Christ. We do not grow by walking in ourselves; we grow by walking in Christ. We have seen that if we would walk in Him, we must first be rooted in Him as the living land. Then we walk as He moves and acts. Such a walk is genuine growth. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KavjviC-d0XiSiopL73LYAPbox-Jc9ycsRXMlBkeWvyXWct-X5tTcxic3H8-f0epm">GROWING WITH THE INCREASE OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="lGebDchapj8MhaQa-6qJi3EWjzf6ACIIEBHfdfUryVbKKL4PAwixxjPTbBKYDu4Le"> My burden in this message is to help the saints see what the genuine growth in life is. Growth is not a matter of becoming refined instead of crude. To grow in life is to grow with the growth of God. It is to grow with the increase of God. True growth is the increase of God, the addition of God. In Himself, God does not need to grow. He is eternal, perfect, and complete. However, there is the need for God to grow in us. How much of the Triune God do you have within you? Do you not need more of the increase, the addition, of God within you? We all need the increase of God. We need to grow with the growth of God; that is, we need God to increase, to grow, in us. I repeat, in Himself God cannot grow and does not need to grow, but it is necessary for God to grow in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="OLv1qDRjKPpb7WeQhnpjddP7iSLMVtJE-1ppPPLq1fp8MR8MpzzfwWWMlwmSEija5"> In order to have genuine growth, we must first be rooted in Christ, our good land. This implies that Christ is our soil, our earth. Otherwise, how could we be rooted in Him? We are plants rooted in Christ as the soil. Therefore, Christ, the processed, all-inclusive Triune God, is our land. Praise the Lord that we have been planted! Having been planted into Christ, we are now rooted in the living Christ who is our good land. </p>

<p data-content-id="ggDaF55GyBbxJPqPBphLCbZafPRKZmgCTqIDR3goq-SVfvSN8prg0TR811vkyUmRZ"> In this message we shall give a general word regarding the extensive revelation of the all-inclusive Christ. Many of us have seen the all-inclusiveness of Christ, but have not seen the extensiveness of Christ. The book of Colossians emphasizes Christ’s extensiveness. Paul’s purpose in writing this book was to show the extensive revelation of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="ebF32ctwP_e7REaxpIcbMtYbboofMvMLDYsGl3bv4T3pP5hTy7t2LO_iBZ3Z1dSVZ"> Christ is universally extensive. No scientist can tell us the dimensions of the universe. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93180" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span> Paul speaks of the dimensions of Christ as the breadth, length, height, and depth. Like the universe, Christ is immeasurable. Such a Christ is our universe. The immeasurable Christ spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93181" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span> is not only the all-inclusive Christ; He is also the extensive Christ, the One who is universally extensive. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5znjdl0RibbATJcKH_ecb09_mcRFpWQnNfuxNd8ItWQaf-xO-QYNQQKXpfnLolJRo">THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS</h2><p data-content-id="NvL9nhfr9y1MfkuCnJjWc5-mHngZYbn-02hvDSNt9dQdENu8DeMorULDAd59B1LCF"> In presenting a revelation of the extensiveness of Christ, the book of Colossians uses a number of unique expressions. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93182" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">1:12</span> we see that Christ is the portion of the saints. The Greek word rendered portion means an allotment. After the children of Israel entered into the good land, the land became their lot, their portion. The good land flowing with milk and honey was an all-inclusive type of Christ. As our good land, Christ is our portion, the portion of the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="t5iqp8-G4gD5mGLTCIR_DHqa-TMdy_VuKEbpWrQpW1yZ_muRMBVOIaTGcMROMFrnI"> This portion is also the image of the invisible God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93183" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">1:15</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93184" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span> Paul uses the term “the image of God”; however, in that verse he does not say that Christ is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="386" id="386">[386]</span> image of the invisible God. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93185" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">1:15</span>, the invisible God has a visible image. </p>
<p data-content-id="6lc_KG4lpSEXBWvOfF9n73K2DTdBhdKSbKVHRXhoCGalmrzef-H9gsKXflDUdQgSY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93186" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">verse 15</span> the term “Firstborn of all creation” stands in apposition to “image of the invisible God.” That there is no conjunction connecting these terms indicates that these terms are synonymous. The image of the invisible God is the Firstborn of all creation, and the Firstborn of all creation is the image of the invisible God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="RfNO2lIzA5Rw54npqQTHNA_TOj86evAgvd8yXLZ0NJhLX6FOEZQflozxR78uf33Oy">THE REALITY OF ALL POSITIVE THINGS</h2><p data-content-id="sQ-jiCKNjXFon2Sit_5DdVXU8cyLS6qUaRJLlAaDAC4Gkuj3zqfMcEH9tudAOZTWi"> According to the principle in the Bible, the first in a certain category often includes all the other items in that category. The book of Revelation says that Christ is the Alpha and the Omega. This does not mean, however, that Christ is only these two letters and not all the letters in between. Because He is the first letter, He is also all the other letters. The principle is the same with respect to the slaughter of the firstborn in the book of Exodus. The firstborn of the Egyptians represented all the Egyptians. Likewise, when the Bible says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, it implies that Christ includes every item of the creation. This concept is confirmed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93187" data-verses="Colossians 2:1">Colossians 2</span>, where Paul says that such things as eating, drinking, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths are shadows and that Christ is the body, the substance, of these shadows. Based upon this illustration, we may go on to say that Christ is our clothing, transportation, housing, and everything to us. But this is altogether different from equating every material thing with Christ. That is pantheism. According to the Bible, we can say that Christ is our food, drink, clothing, and dwelling place. But we cannot turn this around and say that our literal food, clothing, and houses are Christ. That would be the grossly heretical doctrine of pantheism. Nevertheless, we have the biblical ground to say that Christ is the reality of every positive thing in the universe: He is the door, the light, the life, the Shepherd, the pasture. All these aspects of Christ are either mentioned or alluded to in the Gospel of <span class="pg" data-page-id="387" id="387">[387]</span> John. Therefore, we can say that Christ is everything to us, the reality of all positive things. </p>
<p data-content-id="wrbcmMjVyCQkgWdRivfLA0DYpsUML4ud3uqzGEffBGQc6UVl06Y-KY2UHVu1-W7x4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93188" data-verses="Colossians 1:16-17">1:16 and 17</span> Paul says, “Because in Him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him. And He is before all things, and all things subsist together in Him.” Here we see that all things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ. Furthermore, all things are now subsisting together in Christ. The One in whom, through whom, and unto whom all things were created and in whom they subsist is the image, the expression, of God. Thus, God is expressed in the creation of all things in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="LGGjP-PAOdJ8nFxUYQbpLuUqzBMMQvyhMQZw72ekAlg3c478l-zKR4IjWE4Bf53rA"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93189" data-verses="Colossians 1:18">1:18</span> we see that Christ is not only the Firstborn of all creation, but is also the Firstborn from among the dead. This refers to God’s new creation. The old creation came into being by God’s creating activity, whereas the new creation came into being through the resurrection of Christ. Christ is the first both of the old creation and of the new creation, which is the church, the Body of Christ. In the church as God’s new creation, Christ is everything. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93190" data-verses="Colossians 3:10-11">3:10 and 11</span>, Christ is in all the members of the new man and is all the members. </p>

Elsewhere in the New Testament we see that reconciliation involves God’s chosen people, but here we see the reconciliation of all things to God. All things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ. But through man’s fall, all these things were lost. Therefore, there is the need for all things to <span class="pg" data-page-id="388" id="388">[388]</span> be reconciled to God in Christ. Through Christ’s redemption, the reconciliation of all things has taken place. </p>
<p data-content-id="A9Ho75-1IEWiI5pZAWtoolFIGFKNq-gDjip1OYh6Z3Q5wGMSc15rgkFYdiHX9QQ7d"> Notice that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93192" data-verses="Colossians 1:20">verse 20</span> does not say “all people,” but says “all things,” referring to all things which, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93193" data-verses="Colossians 1:16-17">verses 16 and 17</span>, were created in Christ and now subsist in Him. Through Christ’s redemption, all these things were reconciled to God. These things include not only human beings, but also all the creatures. </p>
<p data-content-id="F8T5SrvVvSK9adYDT1faMIT2qJUYTeOvvK68nXJGmPygBYfXAuqVH6_7nXxzbpNoL"> When the book of Colossians was written, the Gnostic concept of the intrinsic evil of matter had a strong influence in Colosse. According to this concept, some thought that everything related to the material world was evil. But Paul pointed out that the very things the Gnostics regarded as evil were among those created in Christ. Furthermore, they are included in the things which have been reconciled to God through the death of Christ. All things have been reconciled to God, “whether things on the earth or things in the heavens.” What an extensive Redeemer Christ is, and what an extensive reconciliation He has accomplished! </p>
<p data-content-id="CV0IHBXEspCOWkPgBxpK-FPjoQK4Ks12YOitnjJYe71lPdJfo-RTTzkzgsHXnVKBu"> In speaking of reconciliation here, Paul’s intention is to emphasize the fact that Christ is the Redeemer not only of mankind, but of all things. Consider the picture of the ark built by Noah. The ark not only saved the eight members of Noah’s family, but also saved animals of every kind. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93194" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span> Peter’s concept of God’s salvation was narrow because of the influence of Judaism. Likewise, our concept of Christ’s work of reconciliation has been limited by the influence of traditional teachings. When I was young, I learned that Christ is our Redeemer. But one day I was troubled by these verses in Colossians which speak of the reconciliation of all things. I asked myself if this included the creatures. Yes, Christ’s extensive reconciliation includes all such things. </p>

Scientists recognize the fact that there is some kind of power in the universe which holds everything together. <span class="pg" data-page-id="389" id="389">[389]</span> This scientific fact fits Paul’s concept of all things subsisting in Christ. Christ is the center that holds everything together, the hub that holds all the spokes. Everything in the universe, living and non-living, subsists in Christ as this hub. If we did not have Christ as the holding center, everything in the universe would collapse. Apparently we exist on this globe, the earth, but actually we are existing in Christ. All things subsist in Him. This is a further aspect of the extensiveness of Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="1aJmujdY8zf3BLa1Nx2x7qmPw9yUJz-3l_vTi90iiOmndjKLwrW8aLxpNk6UPXsej"> The central and underlying thought of the book of Colossians is that, according to God’s ordination, Christ should replace all the elements and factors of our natural human life with Himself. These elements and factors may be summed up in one word—culture. Our human living is constituted of the various aspects of our culture, which is composed of a number of factors and elements. We have seen that the book of Colossians deals with these factors, elements, components, constituents, of our human living. This book reveals the extensive Christ who is the replacement for all these elements in our human living. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9CMGouSfiMWAlo_AF78CKdna42n8y4-Yi6ay6JvhbqmWxQR8qwvMZ9jTvWt74Euid">PHILOSOPHY, TRADITION,<br/>AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD</h2><p data-content-id="jSqu1fKMETv3AEO0jRP6XSxNCbh2dgp3Bj8ZR-J9t-t3Qs846TNRWzfLsChMbFjod"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93208" data-verses="Colossians 2:8">2:8</span> Paul says, “Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.” Philosophy is a primary factor in culture. Furthermore, culture cannot exist without tradition. The terms culture and tradition are almost synonymous. The elements of the world spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93209" data-verses="Colossians 2:8">2:8</span> are the elementary principles, the elementary teachings. Philosophy, tradition, and the elements of the world are all components of culture. All these things are versus Christ. This verse indicates that Christ has come to replace philosophy, tradition, and the elements of the world. Hence, this verse presents a vivid contrast between Christ and philosophy, tradition, and the elements of the world. If a person <span class="pg" data-page-id="398" id="398">[398]</span> does not have Christ, he will surely have these three cultural elements. But once we receive Christ, these things should be replaced by Christ. </p>

These items represent everything in our human living. In particular, the items mentioned are all related to Judaism, with its regulations about eating and drinking, about the observing of days and new moons, and about the Sabbaths. Hence, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93212" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">verse 16</span> speaks of various observances which were components of Jewish life. But as Paul says in the following verse, all these things “are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.” Therefore, in these verses we have another contrast, the contrast between the shadows and Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="QoYPkMNcmTS0w0HcQG2WFMBh8jJNjeno00ymhHKS1B0KuZrfvJx-ndqeKB8A9ADgi"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93213" data-verses="Colossians 2:20-21">verses 20 and 21</span> Paul continues, “If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why as living in the world do you subject yourself to ordinances: do not handle, do not taste, do not touch.” In Romans Paul says that in Christ we are dead to sin, whereas here in Colossians he says that we have died with Christ from the elements of the world, that is, from the factors of our natural human life. Here Paul is telling us that we have died with Christ from our culture. Then he goes on to ask, since this is the case, why we still subject ourselves to ordinances about handling, tasting, and touching. In these verses we have yet another contrast—the contrast between the Christ with whom we have died and the ordinances, which are components of our culture. </p>
<p data-content-id="KavjviC-d0XiSiopL73LYAPboxeJc_ycsRXMlBkeWvyXWct-X5tTcxic3H8-f0epm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93214" data-verses="Colossians 3:10">3:10</span> Paul speaks of the new man and then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93215" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">verse 11</span>, referring to the new man, he says, “Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, <span class="pg" data-page-id="399" id="399">[399]</span> Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.” Here we have the contrast once again between culture and Christ. Paul’s use of the terms barbarian and Scythian indicates that this verse is dealing with the different cultural distinctions. Christ is versus all such distinctions. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lGebDchapj8MhaQa-6qJi3EWjz_6DCoIEBHfdfUryVbKKL4PAwixxjPTbBKYDu4Le">CHRIST REPLACING CULTURE</h2><p data-content-id="OLv1qDRjKPpb7WeQhnpjddP7iSrMWtpE-1ppPPLq1fp8MR8MpzzfwWWMlwmSEija5"> Christ has come in to replace all the aspects of culture mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93216" data-verses="Colossians 2:8">2:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93217" data-verses="Colossians 2:16-17">16-17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93218" data-verses="Colossians 2:20-21">20-21</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93219" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">3:11</span>. Christ must come into our human living to replace philosophy, tradition, and the elements of the world. He must replace eating, drinking, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths. He must replace the ordinances and all the cultural distinctions. When all these things have been fully replaced by Christ, only Christ will remain. This clearly reveals that in Colossians Christ is the replacement for all cultural factors and elements. He must come into our living to replace everything with Himself. This is the divine revelation in the holy Word. Oh, may our eyes be opened to see that every factor, element, and aspect of our natural human life is versus Christ. In God’s economy the extensive Christ must come in to replace all these elements, factors, and aspects. Eventually, for eternity, only Christ will remain. </p>
<p data-content-id="4IBzwnFeZUmiPTldQylpqjfn77UuxIheAumWT0F5vBeYLZvZUxnAH8UtbPcg2OgXO"> Christ is the basic factor in the composition of the Bible. We can truly say, therefore, that the Bible is written with Christ. The letters of the alphabet are symbols of Christ. For this reason in the Bible Christ says, “I am the Alpha and the Omega” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93220" data-verses="Revelation 22:13">Rev. 22:13</span>). If He is the first letter and the last, He must also be all the other letters. In our human living, Christ should be the entire alphabet. If He is our alphabet, He will automatically become every word, sentence, paragraph, and chapter, and ultimately, the whole book. God’s economy is that our entire human living be written, composed, with Christ as the unique factor. For this reason, the book of Colossians unfolds the extensive Christ, the Christ who comes in to fill every part of our living. Therefore, the dictionary of our Christian life should have just one word: Christ. But at the bottom of the page there should be a small <span class="pg" data-page-id="400" id="400">[400]</span> footnote saying, “and the church.” This is the revelation in the book of Colossians. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="omf13Bx02SFTK6-4sHpHdKgUxb2ji_SgyrvnjZRmemRqzlC_dbZvNK2s_tofFhghm">TWO CONDITIONS</h2><p data-content-id="3UjYSiEHFuVk3dorn6OJHP8Sx-9jF_TE1JDXU4fE-zxmVMphWG74zhUcdZ0bQV1Uw"> With this revelation as our basis, we come to the crucial matter of walking in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93221" data-verses="Colossians 2:6">2:6</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93222" data-verses="Colossians 2:6-7">Verses 6 and 7</span> do not say “walk in Him, and be rooted and be built up in Him.” On the contrary, these verses say “walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him.” “Having been rooted” and “being built up” are, respectively, perfect and present participles which describe how we should walk. We can walk in Christ because we have been rooted in Him and because we are being built up in Him. These two conditions must be fulfilled if we are to walk in Christ. Our walk in Christ is based on two conditions: that we have been rooted in Him and that we are being built up in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="GpAIfwI6Fm0o_bJAzhxAk04CVr9spEfbvl-wOzBXDm09fW-1mBX4cRfsZbOTdf_Bp"> The wording of these two verses is simple; however, we may take these verses for granted and not truly understand them. In these verses there are three basic words: walk, rooted, and built. </p>
<p data-content-id="c33eAwsfVfXraWL3f3puOBKwqfqxS9tqYFcEXib3Lo6hB_NVq0ahbWwl2qspOIzbJ"> In Colossians Paul covers the matters of the objective revelation of what Christ is and the subjective ministry by which Christ is dispensed into the believers. The objective revelation of Christ and the subjective ministry of Christ together give us the practical experience of Christ. In this message and in the messages to follow we are particularly concerned with the practical experience of Christ. The objective revelation of the Bible unfolds the extensive and all-inclusive Christ, and the subjective ministry dispenses this very Christ into us to become the replacement for every element of our natural human living. If we see this, we shall then be able to understand what it means to walk in Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="YHo9_4F4rbtTN6uJrNVKlcVHYaJwaukIM1JeaWPCErK8lD8OYCz-gEq8DCxiWamqp">WALKING IN SOMETHING OTHER THAN CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="Ekj8KtyS_lkUZoS96keszutDm3o6B2wcNJn28_oNc3vFOaI1hUNqhE5B4RkV_HSQJ"> The Greek word for walk means to live, act, move, and have our being. It implies everything in our daily living. To walk in Christ is to live, move, act, and have our being in <span class="pg" data-page-id="401" id="401">[401]</span> Christ. We should not live, walk, move, act, or have our being in anything other than Christ. For example, when a sister goes shopping, she should do so in Christ. However, not many sisters go shopping in Christ. Instead, they may decide apart from Christ to go shopping or to purchase certain items. Hence, in the matter of shopping, many sisters do not live and move in Christ. The same may be true of brothers when they get a haircut. In the practical matter of getting a haircut, the brothers may not live and move in Christ. </p>

Then it presents the subjective ministry, the stewardship, by which the all-inclusive Christ is dispensed into us. Finally, it tells us of the practical experience of the Christ who has been ministered into us. Therefore, in Colossians we have the objective revelation, the subjective ministry, and the practical experience. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZIaYAIUhlPYkrS-W4qNUAjewRc--LN35Enf7GKa9aNGLCeSPPJyL_qRbhaKXPVpri">THE ALL-INCLUSIVE ONE IN OUR SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="A9Ho75-1IEWiI5pZAWtoolFIGFqNstwDjip1OYh6Z3Q5wGMSc15rgkFYdiHX9QQ7d"> We who experience Christ have a close, deep, intimate, and subjective relationship with Him. But we need to ask three questions: Who is Christ? What is Christ? Where is Christ? Because Christ is so much, it is difficult to say adequately who He is and what He is. To begin with, Christ is the very God. According to Colossians, He is the Firstborn of all creation. The Bible indicates that Christ is the reality of many different kinds of trees: the fig tree, the olive tree, the vine tree, and the cedar tree. Christ is also the real ox, lamb, lion, eagle, and dove. Furthermore, Christ is our real food, water, milk, honey, air, sunshine, rain, dew, and snow. Eventually, Christ becomes our all-inclusive land, a land in which we have mountains, hills, valleys, fountains, brooks, streams, stones, iron, and brass. Because Christ is such an all-inclusive One, when He was on earth He could use various objects in nature as illustrations of Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="F8T5SrvVvSK9adYDT1faMIT2qJ0YaOuvvK68nXJGmPygBYfXAuqVH6_7nXxzbpNoL"> Concerning where Christ is, we need to realize that, although He is omnipresent and, in particular, is at the <span class="pg" data-page-id="410" id="410">[410]</span> right hand of God in the third heaven, He dwells in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93234" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">1:27</span>). However, it is not easy to realize that Christ is actually in us. We are complicated people, with many chambers, many inward parts. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93235" data-verses="Proverbs 20:27">Proverbs 20:27</span> speaks of man’s inward parts, his inner chambers. These chambers include the mind, emotion, will, heart, soul, inner man, and hidden man. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93236" data-verses="1Peter 3:4">First Peter 3:4</span> speaks of the hidden man, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93237" data-verses="Ephesians 3:16">Ephesians 3:16</span>, of the inner man. We may believe that Christ is in us, but in what chamber of our being is He to be found? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93238" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">Second Timothy 4:22</span> indicates that the Lord is in our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="CV0IHBXEspCOWkPgBxpK-FPjoQq4C8F2YOitnjJYe71lPdJfo-RTTzkzgsHXnVKBu"> Now we must go on to ask what the spirit is and how it differs from the heart and the soul. The Chinese version uses the strange term “heart-spirit.” However, there is no such thing within us as the “heart-spirit.” How regrettable that the translators of the Chinese version used such a term in speaking of the human spirit! Although the translators were scholars, they were mistaken in this point. Others claim that the spirit and the soul are the same. On the one hand, the human spirit is not the heart; on the other hand, it is not the soul. The mind, emotion, will, soul, and heart are included among man’s inward parts, but not one of them is the spirit. The human spirit is in the center of man’s inward parts. For Christ to be in our spirit means that He is in the center of our being, in its very depths. </p>
<p data-content-id="F8T5SrvVvSK9adYDT1faMIT2qJ0YTcOvvK68nXJGmPygBYfXAuqVH6_7nXxzbpNoL"> The spirit, where Christ dwells in the believer, is different from the body and from the soul. The Bible reveals that man is tripartite, composed of spirit, soul, and body. Since the spirit is different from the soul, we must be very definite in speaking of where Christ is within us. We need to say, according to the Bible, that Christ is in our spirit. In the words of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93239" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Corinthians 6:17</span>, we are one spirit with the Lord. The Lord is the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93240" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>), who is one with our spirit. Therefore, these two spirits are one. The Lord not only indwells our spirit, but He has even made Himself one with our spirit. In this way, the two spirits—the life-giving Spirit and our spirit—become one spirit. How close and intimate is our relationship with the Lord! He and we, we and He, are one spirit. What relationship could be <span class="pg" data-page-id="411" id="411">[411]</span> closer and more intimate than this? Surely such a relationship is the ultimate in closeness and intimacy. If we would experience Christ adequately, we need to realize that we have such an intimate relationship with Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CV0IHBXEspCOWkPgBxpK-FPjoQq4Ku12YOitnjJYe71lPdJfo-RTTzkzgsHXnVKBu">LIVING IN ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="P48e1Zv0yLRjkEdD3vDxRlw0owtxDBSsNs7_pSaWHLCXEoMkdyKlIfpN-GyxhQQiF"> However, to realize this is one thing, and to practice it is another thing. We may know that we are one spirit with the Lord, but in our daily living we may not practice living in one spirit with Him. Instead, we may confine the Lord to our spirit and live according to our thought, feeling, and choice. We may insist on the freedom to choose whatever we like, to think our own thoughts, and to allow our affection to run its own course. We may not want to be bothered by the Lord in our spirit. For this reason, in our actual daily living, we may limit Him to our spirit. We may even go so far as to deny our spirit, living as if we had no spirit, but had only a body and a soul. For example, if we want to be angry or talkative, we may do so according to our preference. We simply do not practice living in one spirit with the Lord. When we pray-read, we may praise the Lord that we are one spirit with Him. But in so many practical matters we may utterly neglect the Lord in our spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-8P5_We9HlrZyO3mbt2-Dnw27Ghjn3ZMPtZfEzTH8mFI2NJZdM2qdWpYHt1XsAb0_">THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="piRKMgn5tqXQZ3-2TvISTCkGMuw07Q5jTePG4ht9Tcd7P32I3OUf8n-_v44p36SzH"> The first part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93241" data-verses="Colossians 2:7">2:7</span> says, “Having been rooted and being built up in Him.” The antecedent of the pronoun Him is Christ in the preceding verse. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93242" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">2:2</span>, this Christ is the mystery of God. This brings us to another question: what is the mystery of God? Since Christ is the mystery of God, to be rooted in Christ is to be rooted in the mystery of God. All Christians are familiar with the name Christ, but not many understand the term the mystery of God. God is a mystery. Furthermore, God has a history, a story. What is the history of God, the story of God? God is infinite and eternal, without beginning or ending. According to His good pleasure, He created the heavens and the earth and all the billions of items in the universe. Therefore, God <span class="pg" data-page-id="412" id="412">[412]</span> accomplished the work of creation. Christ is the story of God, the history of God. This means that Christ is not only God Himself, but is also God’s history. God’s history refers to the process through which He has passed so that He may come into man and that man may be brought into Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="vIx9uQjmeEwOiVEgDgH8y0xEfeA03MyCYgINrThFa0OoCG1Z0wmuhOJ40BCNUJHpK"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93243" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span> tells us that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93244" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> speaks of baptizing believers into the name of the Father, the Son, and Spirit. We know that the Father, Son, and Spirit are the God spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93245" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span>. However, the difference is that at the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93246" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span>, God had not yet been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. The word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93247" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> was spoken by the Lord after He had entered into resurrection, having passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion. After His resurrection, He charged His disciples to disciple the nations and to baptize them not into the name of the Creator, whom we may call the unprocessed God, but to baptize them into the name of the Father, the Son, and Spirit. This is to baptize the believers into the processed God. The processed God is God available to His chosen people, and His people can be baptized into Him. Although it is not possible to baptize believers into God as He is revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93248" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span>, we can baptize them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; that is, we can baptize them into the processed Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="W0UKyOT0t1IBxSIccUYMsUMOhQ7Z3c_JmT-k52DOjH1qiyrn6ODlKeTuGk-ooeEF4"> Today the processed Triune God is the Spirit. At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93249" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span>, the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified. He had not yet passed through death and entered into resurrection. Now that Christ has passed through death and has entered into resurrection, the Spirit is here. This Spirit is Christ, and Christ is the story of God, the mystery of God. As the story of God, Christ is the processed God, God processed to become the all-inclusive Spirit, who now dwells in our spirit and is one with our spirit. </p>

<p data-content-id="2KhgJ0DuKwQnI2lO6O2N5dgXqc7pez9kMP3qeHnY675TwiRdcLBNxgl-yEWidZOr3"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93259" data-verses="Colossians 2:6">2:6</span> Paul says, “As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.” Walking in Christ is based on receiving Christ. Walking in Him comes out of receiving Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="uei5QW3MGv90tAA2FxD3LJZfePn-Cqx75QFjeBrVrSzVrCFjdoepppbzqxBliOuF8"> Many Christians think that to receive Christ is simply to believe in Him. Receiving Christ, however, is not as simple as this. In order to understand what is the proper, genuine, and adequate receiving of Christ, we need to know the Christ whom we are to receive. According to our concept and according to traditional doctrine, Christ is rather simple. Many believers only realize that Christ, the Son of God, is the Savior who loved us and died for us. If we believe in Christ, we are saved. However, the receiving of Christ in a book such as Colossians involves a great deal more than this. We have pointed out that Colossians affords us an extensive revelation of the all-inclusive Christ. This Christ is more vast than the whole universe. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93260" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span>, Christ is the breadth, length, height, and depth. The Christ whom we have received is immeasurable. He is universally vast. </p>
<p data-content-id="f5FHReDvsyzvBMFzyvsIslz0WMllKKagmUB6rb4-E6X-5JRriI2ZE461KcHMoNa9f"> Although we have received Christ, our receiving of Him goes beyond an initial receiving of Him once for all. On the contrary, we shall continue to receive Him eternally. Receiving Christ can be compared to breathing. Just as breathing is a continual process, so our receiving of Christ should take place continually. Regrettably, however, a great many Christians have had only the initial receiving of Christ. They do not receive Him continuously. Many believers can tell you that at a certain time in the past they <span class="pg" data-page-id="418" id="418">[418]</span> received Christ. But they have not continued to receive Him. If we do not receive Christ continually, we shall not enjoy the full benefit of the Christ we have received initially. Many Christians have not continued to receive Christ. Hence, we must realize that our receiving of Him must be consistent and continual. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Ij7bPPSnYgJ7k5YLk7p3WF7OAtk40xispqhi6sQh09yxxcsmTBisNQ0qrwyEIQciJ">THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="HJXSCv7FjRX11Nlg8l5j7efQi5XgGfJ6T3GdC5v5dCb9ChbHCNsZDKBUk5DL1WVtx"> The Christ we have received according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93261" data-verses="Colossians 2:1-6">2:1-6</span> is the mystery of God spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93262" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">2:2</span>. The fact that Christ is the mystery of God indicates that He is not simple. Rather, He is immeasurable and mysterious. To be sure, God is not simple. He is unlimited, infinite, eternal. How, then, could Christ, the mystery of God, be simple? As the mystery of God, Christ is the immeasurable, infinite, and eternal God. </p>
<p data-content-id="c33eAwsfVfXraWL3f3puOBKwqcKxS_tqYFcEXib3Lo6hB_NVq0ahbWwl2qspOIzbJ"> Although God is eternal, He also has a history. Of course, to say that God has a history is to speak in human terms for our understanding. In the beginning, in eternity past, God had a good pleasure, the desire of His heart. The more living a person is, the greater is his desire for pleasure. Thus, as the most living One, God has the greatest desire. God is living, aggressive, and energetic. As such a living One, He has a good pleasure. Based upon this good pleasure, which is the desire of His heart, God made a plan. The biblical term for this plan is purpose. God is purposeful; He has an eternal purpose based on His good pleasure. This purpose is to have a group of living beings to be His corporate expression. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="YHo9_4F4rbtTN6uJrNVKlcVHYZpwaskIM1JeaWPCErK8lD8OYCz-gEq8DCxiWamqp">MAN CREATED WITH A RECEIVER</h2><p data-content-id="Ekj8KtyS_lkUZoS96keszutDm0I6C2QcNJn28_oNc3vFOaI1hUNqhE5B4RkV_HSQJ"> In order for such a group of beings to come into existence, God created the heavens, the earth, and billions of items. The center of God’s creation is man, who was created with a receiver, the human spirit. Just as a radio receiver has the capacity to receive radio waves, so our spirit has the capacity to receive God. Suppose a person from a primitive part of the world is shown a transistor radio for the first time and is told that it can give forth sounds transmitted through the air. If the radio is properly tuned, that person would be <span class="pg" data-page-id="419" id="419">[419]</span> amazed at the sounds. But if the receiver does not function, he may argue that there are in fact no radio waves in the air. A transistor radio may have a beautiful casing, but if the receiver does not work, the radio is useless. Millions of people today are like broken transistor radios. Outwardly they appear very good, but their spirit has been damaged. The receiver within them does not function properly. This is the reason that atheists proclaim there is no God. Because their receiver does not function to substantiate God, they say God does not exist. If a broken radio receiver is repaired, the radio will work once again. In like manner, when our damaged receiver, our human spirit, is regenerated, it can function to substantiate God. </p>
<p data-content-id="DoDlSswZom_4i2OTnuzO3QHEA6MZ3SZ-vevsKnj9CyhxI_r5snfUvFBDoS7HJ6EHS"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93263" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">Zechariah 12:1</span>, God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. In this verse the spirit of man is ranked with the heavens and the earth. This shows the crucial significance of the human spirit. The spirit of man was created purposely and specifically to be a receiver to take God in. In order for man to exist with a spirit to receive God, there was the need of the earth and of the heavens. The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man, with his spirit, his receiver, is for God. Through His work of creation, God produced the environment necessary for the fulfillment of His purpose. </p>

Therefore, creation was followed by incarnation. In the process of incarnation, God became a man, born of the virgin Mary in a very humble way. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93264" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>, the child born to us was the mighty God. This means that the infant born in that manger in Bethlehem was the mighty God Himself. As a child, He grew up in Nazareth, in the despised region of Galilee. He did not live in the mansion of a rich man, but He lived in the house of a poor carpenter. Imagine that Jesus, the mighty God incarnate, lived in a carpenter’s house in Nazareth for about thirty <span class="pg" data-page-id="420" id="420">[420]</span> years! The Creator of the whole universe lived on earth in such a way. This is a vital part of God’s history. </p>
<p data-content-id="ebF32ctwP_e7REaxpIcbMtYbbr4fL8MLDYsGl3bv4T3pP5hTy7t2LO_iBZ3Z1dSVZ"> To this day, the Jews do not believe in the incarnation. Rather, they would proclaim that their God is not that small. However, we believe and declare that our God became a small man and lived on earth for thirty-three and one half years. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93265" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isaiah 53</span> and the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus was a man without form or comeliness. Furthermore, the very One who said, “Let there be light” and caused light to shine out of darkness was the One who worked for years as a carpenter. </p>
<p data-content-id="5znjdl0RibbATJcKH_ecb09_mfBFvFAnNfuxNd8ItWQaf-xO-QYNQQKXpfnLolJRo"> At the end of His life on earth, the Lord Jesus was crucified. We need to realize that the One who was crucified was God Himself. In a hymn written by Charles Wesley there are these lines: </p>

Afterward, He was buried in the tomb and took a tour through Hades, the region of death. Although Satan did everything possible to hold Him, on the third day He arose from the dead and came out of the tomb in resurrection. Now, in resurrection, He is the life-giving Spirit. By incarnation God became a man, and in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit. </p>

To a great degree, our human living is composed of culture. Humanly speaking, culture is very good. Every society is preserved and maintained by culture. If people did not have culture, there would be much more work for the police department and the law courts. At present, the work of the police and the courts is a supplement to the culture of a society. When a person does not conduct himself properly according to culture, the police may intervene. Every nation, society, and community is preserved by culture, the law, and the police. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qcLWvpSjI1XL62hLozF8aNmkaccb8TaDsla5rdBghIZYVZKEAFjA56Gig5TWSCGAX">THE PROPER USE OF CULTURE</h2><p data-content-id="yrS9bX0cFSGgVgun4Ufhw1Icgfbv6wOF1ONqnoyndBoPJWI5e-rH93nABe6-78JSB"> If, after reading these messages on Christ versus culture, Christian parents tell their children that they no longer need culture, this will be a serious mistake. Without culture, children would act like animals. Children must be raised according to the standards of culture. Before they are of a proper age to receive Christ, the children must be built up in culture. The more the children are trained according to culture, the better it will be for them. The children must be trained to honor their parents, to love their brothers and sisters, to behave properly toward their neighbors, to be good students in school, to obey all laws, and to respect their teachers and other adults. Because children are too young to behave according to Christ, they must be taught to behave according to culture. If we did not have culture, we would be barbarians. <span class="pg" data-page-id="426" id="426">[426]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="8W3SYV3ote4j4Rg0nTLNGDsaYU7YP1GEc9qelKbjNksm4WKd2cErScxTa7rBwQTLq"> The use of culture can be compared to the function of the law in the Scriptures. The law was decreed by God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93275" data-verses="Romans 7:12">Romans 7:12</span> says that “the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.” Used rightly, the law kept God’s chosen people in custody until the coming of Christ. Rich families in ancient times had custodians who exercised custody over the children. In like manner, culture keeps children in custody today. However, as the book of Galatians indicates, the law was misused by the Judaizers. Now that Christ has come, the law should deliver God’s chosen people to Christ. But the Judaizers misused the law, even over-using it. Instead of allowing the law to release God’s chosen people and to give them over to Christ, the Judaizers used the law to keep people from Christ. The concept of the Judaizers even crept into the church to distract some of the genuine Jewish believers in Christ back to the law. Although culture is right and necessary, it is also subject to misuse and can actually keep people from Christ. Culture should be used to keep the children until they are able to receive Christ and live according to Christ. Children need to be preserved by culture while they are growing up. </p>
<p data-content-id="0dvJwNTlnFFL7ZQjBM_mXPhF5h7x8B4_QdjxYstvjmR9qWy9nTfOsrOtXWOoopoj0"> As Moses gave the commandments to God’s chosen people, parents must give commandments to their children. But when the children are able to realize their need for Christ and repent, we should minister the rich Christ to them and help them to receive Him. We should tell our children that the culture we gave them was only good for a certain time and that now they need to receive Christ. Hence, culture is used by God through parents to keep their children in custody until the time comes for them to receive the Lord. It is important to see this proper use of culture. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="uei5QW3MGv90tAA2FxD3LJZfeP3-F4R75QFjeBrVrSzVrCFjdoepppbzqxBliOuF8">FILLED WITH CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="f5FHReDvsyzvBMFzyvsIslz0WM1lMYqgmUB6rb4-E6X-5JRriI2ZE461KcHMoNa9f"> Now that we have received Christ, He, the all-inclusive, extensive One, must replace every aspect of our culture with Himself. We have seen that fallen man uses culture as a substitute for God. First, such a culture is a substitute for God. Then Christ comes in to replace this substitute with Himself. <span class="pg" data-page-id="427" id="427">[427]</span> Since we are no longer children, we need Christ to replace every element of our culture. This does not mean that we should despise culture. Rather, it means that we should love Christ. If we are filled to the brim with Christ, there will not be any room in our being for anything else. Every part of us will be occupied by Christ and with Christ. Then in our experience we shall have the fullness of Christ. We shall be filled with Christ to the extent of our capacity. The Christ who fills our being will replace our culture with Himself. This is the revelation in the book of Colossians. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ij7bPPSnYgJ7k5YLk7p3WF7OAt049jispqhi6sQh09yxxcsmTBisNQ0qrwyEIQciJ"> Because Christ is extensive and all-inclusive, with Him there is no scarcity. If we have such a Christ in our experience, we shall not need anything else. There is no need that He cannot meet, and no capacity to receive Him that He cannot fill. Since we have the all-inclusive Christ, we do not need Judaism, Gnosticism, or asceticism. We have the all-inclusive and extensive Christ with His fullness. He could fill the whole universe, and still He would not be exhausted. We do not need anything, ancient or modern, in place of Christ. We do not even need our self-made and self-imposed culture. I am concerned that many among us still live according to their self-imposed culture. These saints are always imposing restrictions on themselves and living according to them. There is no need for us to remain in the custody of our self-made culture. Instead, we should stay in Christ and in the freedom we have in Christ. We need to be filled to the brim with Christ. This is the underlying concept of the book of Colossians. Christ, the extensive One, must replace every element of our natural human life. This requires that we not hold on to anything of our culture, for that would produce a mixture. Let us allow the pure Christ to fill our being and replace every aspect of our natural human life with Himself. </p>

If you have such a disposition and such virtues, you should neither hate them nor treasure them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="428" id="428">[428]</span> Instead, you should allow the extensive Christ to replace even your good disposition and your virtues. God does not want us to live out our natural being with its virtues. If you live according to your disposition and your virtues, you will not be able to say with Paul, “To me to live is Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93276" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Phil. 1:21</span>). On the contrary, you will have to admit that to you to live is your natural being. In the church as the new man, there is no room for any kind of natural person. In the new man Christ must be all and in all (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93277" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">3:11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="kX1nUfZuqQkzrLrgt3NFkih8jChwQ2eJ9RDPm9pQmA9VJDK3iAAZbqak9qWDfH_Sw"> We have pointed out that we should neither hate our natural being nor treasure it. To hate our being is to practice asceticism, a form of suicide. Instead of trying to hate the natural being, we should follow the Lord’s word to deny ourselves. To deny the self is to ignore the self, to forget it, to pay no attention to it. Suppose as you are walking down the sidewalk, someone stops you and begs you for money. Again and again, he pleads with you to give him money. You should neither hate this person nor love him. Rather you should pay no attention to his request. Eventually, realizing that he can get nothing from you, he will go away. This illustrates the attitude we should have toward the self. The self is greedy, always begging for things. Instead of either hating the self or loving it, we should simply refuse to pay attention to it. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="J_nFMNQorB6p2GT8JBzVIJEJlj9RIYNHJ9mfOn7jgTGQpHDcX8vywWDQZdhqUypmp">ATTRACTED BY CHRIST AND POSSESSED BY HIM</h2><p data-content-id="zxxKVZo0L_3UdrO9iX46Tdlvxl1Hq-fB11uoqtjPBjhY_rEsDeSQDqGrA0qATN0ay"> However, if we would keep from paying attention to the self, we must concentrate on something better than the self. This is the reason we need a vision of the extensiveness of Christ, the vision presented in the book of Colossians. If we see this vision, we shall concentrate our entire being on the extensive Christ, who will then fill us and occupy us. Because we are filled with the extensive Christ, we shall have no need of Judaism, Gnosticism, mysticism, or asceticism. Our being will be occupied with the vast, unsearchably rich, extensive Christ. Spontaneously this Christ will come in to replace every aspect of our natural human life with Himself. <span class="pg" data-page-id="429" id="429">[429]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="lGebDchapj8MhaQa-6qJi3EWiyf6KQoIEBHfdfUryVbKKL4PAwixxjPTbBKYDu4Le"> The revelation of the all-inclusive and extensive Christ is found adequately, fully, definitely, and clearly in the Epistles of Paul, in particular in the book of Colossians. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93308" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">1:25</span> Paul says that he became a minister according to the stewardship of God to complete the word of God. Colossians was written to complete the word of God, to complete the divine revelation <span class="pg" data-page-id="434" id="434">[434]</span> in the Scriptures. Without Colossians, the divine revelation in the Scriptures would not be complete. </p>
<p data-content-id="OLv1qDRjKPpb7WeQhnpjddP7jTLMe_5E-1ppPPLq1fp8MR8MpzzfwWWMlwmSEija5"> The completion of the Word of God found in Colossians is the mystery of God’s economy—Christ in us, the hope of glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93309" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">1:27</span>). This means that without Christ in us as the hope of glory, God’s revelation would have no completion. We thank the Lord that His revelation is completed, recorded, and presented to us. </p>

However, it has been neglected. Although Christ has been revealed adequately, definitely, emphatically, and fully, in the experience of Christians He has been replaced by many other things. Although there are millions of Christians in this country, not many have paid adequate attention to Christ in us, the hope of glory. This has been true even among us. In particular, culture has replaced Christ. In 1961 I wrote the hymn, “Not the law of letters, but the Christ of life” (<em>Hymns,</em> #541). But in this hymn I did not say anything about culture. When I wrote it, I did not see that culture was the strongest and most subtle replacement of Christ in our experience. Nevertheless, more than forty-five years ago, I saw that God does not want anything other than Christ. Although this vision is very clear, I must confess that I still do not live Christ adequately. From time to time, I have been distracted from Christ to other things. </p>
<p data-content-id="h3ZNAj-7-mNpWfPCijhB17Zq4MbLJTqT5I-hwnsewSx8Ec6pwTMhh2r5WyeY8HZbS"> Have you ever asked yourself how much you live Christ day by day? For the most part, we live Christ only when we are praying in the spirit. By this we see how little we actually live Christ. In our daily living Christ is replaced by other things. In particular, things that are good in our eyes become replacements for Christ. For example, Christ may be replaced by your humility. Spontaneously and unconsciously, you live your natural humility instead of Christ. Inwardly, a naturally humble person may be proud of his humility, especially when he compares himself with others. But this humility of which he boasts is a replacement of <span class="pg" data-page-id="435" id="435">[435]</span> Christ. Actually, such humility is not a virtue in the eyes of God. Because it replaces Christ, it is something very unpleasant. Day by day, Christ is replaced by many things. He may be replaced by our diligence, frankness, and honesty. Instead of living Christ, we may live these natural attributes or characteristics. </p>

First Corinthians deals with gifts and knowledge. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93310" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:7">1 Corinthians 1:7</span> Paul said that the Corinthians came behind in no gift. Furthermore, they had much knowledge, including spiritual knowledge. Nevertheless, they were carnal. Their knowledge did not help them adequately, and their gifts did not build them up. Paul told them that when he first came to them, he determined not to know anything among them except Jesus Christ and Him crucified (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93311" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:2">1 Cor. 2:2</span>). Paul realized that the Corinthians were occupied with knowledge and gifts. For this reason, he emphasized the crucified Christ. This indicates that the Corinthian believers needed to live a crucified life, a life of the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="Vehc_DxwcgXUMWVvg6ZqRxQAY92kSJcmilbKcMYbZp13kc_c_BsTJjIrnVSGak81f"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93312" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:22">1 Corinthians 1:22</span> Paul said, “For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom.” To the Jews, the crucified Christ was a stumbling block, and to the Greeks, He was foolishness. Neither the Jews nor the Greeks cared for such a Christ. They preferred a Christ of splendor to a Christ crucified. However, Paul told them that he did not want to know anything among them except Christ and Him crucified. </p>
<p data-content-id="iiCXRFpuXcPrT8Ib2ei9Wmk1CkJyhe2ws6tpqdIZHirz4qBni4rQoR_fScofdndKl"> In the book of 1 Corinthians Paul eventually indicated that to have the church life we need the experience of Christ crucified. The church life must be a crucified life. What the Corinthian believers needed was to live a crucified Christ and not pay their attention to knowledge and spiritual gifts. </p>
<p data-content-id="1aJmujdY8zf3BLa1Nx2x7qmPx8SUNgu3l_vTi90iiOmndjKLwrW8aLxpNk6UPXsej"> In Corinth Christ was replaced by knowledge and gifts. In the charismatic movement today, Christ is also replaced by the gifts. Where in charismatic meetings is Christ emphasized and realized properly? Today Christ is still being replaced by <span class="pg" data-page-id="436" id="436">[436]</span> knowledge and gifts. Of course, He is also replaced by the various forms, rituals, and ordinances of religion. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9CMGouSfiMWAlo_AF78CKdna53H81oeYi6ay6JvhbqmWxQR8qwvMZ9jTvWt74Euid">CHRIST REPLACED BY RELIGION</h2><p data-content-id="jSqu1fKMETv3AEO0jRP6XSxNDaB2bwZ3Bj8ZR-J9t-t3Qs846TNRWzfLsChMbFjod"> In the book of Galatians we see that Christ was replaced by Judaism. Judaism was a religion in which people worshipped the true God according to His holy Word. This religion included the law, which had been given by God through Moses, and also circumcision, the ordinances, and the traditions. Paul advanced in this religion and surpassed his contemporaries. But one day, when he was on the way to Damascus, the Lord Jesus appeared to him. At that time, God revealed the living Christ into Paul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93313" data-verses="Galatians 1:16">Gal. 1:16a</span>). Thus, in the book of Galatians we have a clear record of how Christ was replaced by the Jewish religion with the law, circumcision, and the traditions. </p>
<p data-content-id="Twq0tWAMk6bVuZEt9Z9lD5HOCRoTStIdL3jAfCQiy5hBnTJuAz_YAL8NdDTj2RtGV"> When the book of Galatians was written, not only had the Jews replaced Christ with such a religion, but even many saints had been influenced to turn from Christ to the law and circumcision. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93314" data-verses="Galatians 5:2">Galatians 5:2</span>, if we are circumcised, Christ will not profit us at all. Those who seek to be justified by the law are actually “brought to nought from Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93315" data-verses="Galatians 5:4">v. 4</span>). This means that if we try to be righteous by keeping the law, we shall be severed from Christ, and He will be of no effect to us. This indicates clearly that the law can replace Christ and keep God’s people from Christ. Furthermore, circumcision annuls the grace of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="nAAjrYoSxORsKcXED0Y92nk_jOG8dCrYu242cBU-V2b50Voz0s71JJrl7esVgPqMx"> The law had been given by God, and circumcision and many rituals had been ordained by God. The Jews used all these things apparently for God. However, the law, circumcision, and the ordinances, the components of the Jewish religion, replaced Christ and were used to distract the believers from Christ. The saints in Galatia were distracted from Christ to certain God-given and God-ordained things. In their case, Christ was replaced by religion. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6lc_KG4lpSEXBWvOfF9n73K2CSNBidqSbKVHRXhoCGalmrzef-H9gsKXflDUdQgSY">CHRIST REPLACED BY CULTURE</h2><p data-content-id="RfNO2lIzA5Rw54npqQTHNA_TPis6dvggvd8yXLZ0NJhLX6FOEZQflozxR78uf33Oy"> According to the book of Colossians, Christ is replaced by culture. Any culture is a composition of a number of items. <span class="pg" data-page-id="437" id="437">[437]</span> Western culture, for example, is a composition of Hebrew religion, Greek philosophy, and Roman politics. When the book of Colossians was written, the culture in the region of Colosse included Hebrew religion, Greek philosophy, asceticism, mysticism, and Gnosticism. Although the word culture is not used in this book, culture is nonetheless strongly indicated or implied. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93316" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">3:11</span> Paul says that in the new man there is no Greek or Jew, no circumcision or uncircumcision, no barbarian or Scythian. These terms indicate both religious and cultural distinctions. Circumcision and uncircumcision refer to religion, whereas barbarian and Scythian refer to culture. Thus, the book of Colossians indicates that the ultimate replacement for Christ is our culture. </p>

However, Colossians is also a book of experience. The extensive, all-inclusive Christ revealed in this book is subjective to us, for He dwells in us as our hope of glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93337" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">1:27</span>), and He is our life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93338" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">3:4</span>). Nothing can be more subjective to us than our own life. In fact, our life is us. To say that Christ is our life means that Christ becomes us. How could Christ be our life without actually becoming us? It would be impossible. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sr4B7OdLi_gaxbmxLXiEYa2SV36IO5vLZGWdu23POQDxs7Xqf3z_YUMIa59gSQKwD"> Some Christian teachers oppose the revelation we have seen concerning the subjective experience of Christ. According to them, we deify ourselves, we make ourselves God. They claim that we teach that the self becomes the same as God and that this is self-deification. Although we definitely do not teach that we become God Himself or that we shall ever be worshipped as deity, it is nonetheless true that Christ dwells in us and that He is our life. He becomes us in our experience. As Paul says, “To me to live is Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93339" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Phil. 1:21</span>). We have pointed out that Christ cannot be our life without becoming us. Life is our very being. Hence, for Christ to be our life means that He becomes our being. For Christ to become our being is for Christ to become us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="444" id="444">[444]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ggDaF55GyBbxJPqPBphLCbZaeORKVmgCTqIDR3goq-SVfvSN8prg0TR811vkyUmRZ"> To us, Christ is both objective and subjective. We know Christ both according to doctrine and according to experience. On the one hand, our Christ is on the throne in the heavens. On the other hand, He is in our spirit. We worship the enthroned Christ in the heavens, but we experience, enjoy, and partake of the indwelling Christ in our spirit. We are one with Him in a very subjective way. As Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93340" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Corinthians 6:17</span>, “He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.” Christ is subjective to us to such a degree that He and we, we and He, have become one spirit. To be one spirit with the Lord is greater than to have gifts and miracles. Now that we have become one spirit with the Lord, in our daily life we need to experience being one spirit with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="aw_owglmYsbhVQpnqDeZZJvwXhVpyIPcebdjcPDhLYFI9FSkEF8RpLBEHkqv-h5U3"> Some years ago I stayed with some saints who talked a lot about <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93341" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">Colossians 1:27</span>. Although they could speak of the indwelling Christ as the hope of glory, they had very little experience of Christ. To them, the indwelling Christ was merely a doctrine, not a reality. In their practical daily living, they were ethical and religious, but they did not live Christ. Even their love was a natural, ethical love, not the expression of Christ lived out from within them. In these believers you could see religion and ethics, but you could not see much of Christ. This is true of many Christians today. They know Christ in doctrine, but they have very little genuine experience of Him. However, when Paul wrote the book of Colossians, he wrote both according to doctrine and according to experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="bII_pa96wW65xpS_TOga8Qb0p02g1dUpsR-fiE2GZ2XncQE7FKuNnsp2sqi-cXeIt"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93342" data-verses="Colossians 2:7">2:7</span> Paul speaks of having been rooted and being built up in Christ. Both being rooted and being built up are subjective and experiential. We need a clear understanding of what it is to be rooted in Christ and to be built up in Him. We should neither take <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93343" data-verses="Colossians 2:7">2:7</span> for granted, nor avoid it because we find it difficult to understand. Instead, we should dwell on this verse, pray-reading it and studying it until we receive light. </p>

If we would walk <span class="pg" data-page-id="445" id="445">[445]</span> in Christ, we must meet two conditions: we must be rooted in Him, and we must be in the process of being built up in Him. On the one hand, we have already been rooted in Christ; on the other hand, we are being built up in Him. When these conditions are met, we shall be able to walk in Christ. In experience we all need to know what it means to be rooted in Christ and to be built up in Him. </p>

In a number of places, the Bible speaks of planting. In the song of Moses we read these words: “Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93345" data-verses="Exodus 15:17">Exo. 15:17</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93346" data-verses="Psalms 92:13">Psalm 92:13</span> says, “Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93347" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:21">Jeremiah 2:21</span> the Lord says of His people, “Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93348" data-verses="Jeremiah 32:41">32:41</span>, “I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93349" data-verses="Matthew 15:13">Matthew 15:13</span> the Lord Jesus said, “Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93350" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>, the Lord Jesus regarded Himself as a vine and the Father as the husbandman, the One who planted the vine and cares for it. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93351" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span> Paul says that we, the believers, are God’s farm (Gk.). He also declares, “I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the growth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93352" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:6">1 Cor. 3:6</span>, Gk.). Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93353" data-verses="Colossians 2:7">Colossians 2:7</span> we see that we have been rooted into Christ. Christ is the land, the soil, and God has planted us into Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="7cuojx9EnikxgkGvSa0_PvMZLlR3cME5yo0N_UaqITA8UbezEJgBcuGWFgD9_1aau"> According to the Scriptures, Christ is the unique tree into which we have been grafted and also the land, the soil, into which we have been planted. We have been both grafted into Christ and planted into Him. Hence, the good land with the soil is equal to the tree. This is another indication that Christ is everything to us. Since Christ is both the tree and the good land, we can say that we have been grafted into Christ and also that we have been planted into Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="446" id="446">[446]</span> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93354" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>, God the Father is the Planter, the Husbandman, whose Son, Christ, is the universal vine. This Christ is also the good land with the soil. We have been grafted into Christ as the vine and planted into Him as the soil. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93355" data-verses="Colossians 2:11">Colossians 2:11</span> speaks of circumcision, a type of cutting. This is related to being grafted into Christ. As we have pointed out, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93356" data-verses="Colossians 2:7">2:7</span> speaks of having been rooted in Christ. This is related to being planted into Him. In this message our concern is not with the aspect of grafting, but with the aspect of planting. </p>
<p data-content-id="_0z4CjgcRAzGySPl6nQ9kckrW8MiI0FLuxfmejJOVBUIS_-qK7UtCn7ND1Qwyrk2f"> As those who have been planted into Christ, we have been rooted in Him. Just as the tiny root hairs absorb the riches from the soil, so we absorb the rich nourishment of Christ. We are trees, and Christ is the soil into which we have been planted and in which we are rooted. Now we are absorbing His riches into us, and we grow by the nourishment we receive from these riches. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BOCvS1r-7tIB54EhOvqqTqjpyqkq6Ypvx43xAqzzl996JaIsWLw395nl-aNWe_mB3">ONE UNIT IN LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="xhOwCJPMz8poSokM7QjIveWcSUVv-XtC3D97biFQx_aZezgsPp4uXJaG_Tl_jpc6R"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93357" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:6">1 Corinthians 3:6</span> Paul says that he planted, Apollos watered, and God gave the growth. This indicates that the believers are plants and that Christ is the soil. Now we need to ask in what part of our being this planting has taken place. Certainly it is neither in the mind nor in the physical body. Rather, it is in our spirit. The experience of being planted into Christ and rooted in Him takes place in our spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93358" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">First Corinthians 6:17</span> says, “He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.” When a plant is rooted in the soil, it becomes one with the soil. First the plant gets into the soil; then the nourishment in the soil comes into the plant. In this way, the plant and the soil become one in life. The nourishing element in the soil corresponds to the life in the plant, and something within the plant corresponds to the element in the soil. We may say that there is a fellowship between the plant and the soil. In this fellowship those factors in the plant and in the soil which correspond to each other become one in life. Thus, the plant and the soil become one unit in life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="447" id="447">[447]</span> </p>

We may read a verse such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93376" data-verses="Colossians 2:7">2:7</span>, which speaks of having been rooted in Christ and of being built up in Him, and we may assume that we understand it, when actually our understanding is very superficial. The same may be true even of verses such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93377" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>. On the one hand, we have some understanding of this verse. But, on the other hand, we may take very much for granted. Furthermore, in reading the Bible we may have the tendency to avoid difficulties. We may prefer not to dig into certain verses, pray about them, and ask the Lord to open them to us. As we consider a number of verses from Colossians, 1 Corinthians, and Ephesians, we should not take things for granted, and we should not avoid any difficulty presented by these verses. In particular, my burden is for us to see the implications in these verses. </p>

The word rooted is very rich in its implications. To be rooted is altogether a matter of life. A plant that has been rooted in the soil grows in the earth and even into the earth. It is a living organism which grows in the soil. If, on <span class="pg" data-page-id="452" id="452">[452]</span> the contrary, a dead stick is thrust into the earth, that stick cannot be said to be rooted in the soil. </p>
<p data-content-id="1aJmujdY8zf3BLa1Nx2x7qmPx8yUFz-3l_vTi90iiOmndjKLwrW8aLxpNk6UPXsej"> As the roots of a plant spread into the soil, they absorb the riches from the soil. The nourishment that is absorbed into the plant becomes the very element by which the plant grows. In order for a plant to grow, it must receive through the roots a certain substance or element. It is by this substance that the plant increases in size. </p>
<p data-content-id="9CMGouSfiMWAlo_AF78CKdna53n81qeYi6ay6JvhbqmWxQR8qwvMZ9jTvWt74Euid"> As believers, we have been rooted in Christ. This implies that we are living organisms, not lifeless and rootless sticks thrust into the soil. Because we have been rooted in Christ, we now may absorb the riches of Christ into us. These riches, absorbed from Christ as the soil, become the very element which enables us to grow. </p>
<p data-content-id="jSqu1fKMETv3AEO0jRP6XSxNDah2byZ3Bj8ZR-J9t-t3Qs846TNRWzfLsChMbFjod"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93379" data-verses="Colossians 2:7">Colossians 2:7</span> speaks of having been rooted in Christ and of being built up in Him. The more a plant grows, the more it builds itself up. A tree, for example, builds itself up by absorbing into itself nourishment from the soil. This implies organic activity. Through this activity the nourishment from the soil is absorbed into the tree. </p>
<p data-content-id="Twq0tWAMk6bVuZEt9Z9lD5HOCRITRtodL3jAfCQiy5hBnTJuAz_YAL8NdDTj2RtGV"> It is significant that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93380" data-verses="Colossians 2:7">2:7</span> Paul puts being rooted and building together. The reason for this is that being rooted is for growing, and growing is genuine building. Growth is not only for building, but is actually the building itself. As a tree grows, it builds itself up. The same is true of human beings. As all mothers realize, the more their children are nourished with healthy food, the more they grow, and by growing, they are built up. The organic activity that takes place within them causes them to grow. This growth is the building of their physical bodies. </p>
<p data-content-id="nAAjrYoSxORsKcXED0Y92nk_jOm8eCLYu242cBU-V2b50Voz0s71JJrl7esVgPqMx"> Being rooted brings in the growing, and the growing is the building. If we do not grow, we cannot have any building. We grow by absorbing the rich, nourishing element of the soil. Having been rooted in Christ, we now are being built up in Him. We have been rooted in Christ, and we grow by absorbing His riches into us. This leads to growth, which is the building up of ourselves in Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="453" id="453">[453]</span> </p>

Of course, to hold the Head implies that we are not detached, or severed, from Him. At the time Paul wrote to the Colossians, they had been somewhat detached from Christ by their culture. Culture can be a form of insulation which keeps us from Christ. To hold the Head is to remain in Christ without any insulation between us and Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="sQ-jiCKNjXFon2Sit_5DdVXU9dCLS7qUaRJLlAaDAC4Gkuj3zqfMcEH9tudAOZTWi"> The words “out from Whom” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93382" data-verses="Colossians 2:19">verse 19</span> indicate that something is coming out from the Head to cause the Body to grow. The growth of the Body depends on what comes out of Christ as the Head, just as the growth of a plant depends on what comes into the plant from the soil. If a plant does not absorb nutrients from the soil, the plant cannot grow. Likewise, if we do not receive what comes out from Christ as the Head, the Body cannot grow. Holding the Head is, therefore, equal to being rooted in Christ as the soil. </p>

We <span class="pg" data-page-id="454" id="454">[454]</span> grow with the increase of God within us. God in Himself is perfect and complete, but there is still the need for Him to increase within us. </p>

I realized my need for God to grow in me, to have Him added into me. At that time I was enlightened to see the meaning of Paul’s expression in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93386" data-verses="Colossians 2:19">2:19</span>, “grows with the growth of God.” We all need God to be added into us more and more.

<p data-content-id="F8T5SrvVvSK9adYDT1faMIT2rIkYQcuvvK68nXJGmPygBYfXAuqVH6_7nXxzbpNoL"> As we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93387" data-verses="Colossians 2:19">2:19</span>, we must realize that the word God is not merely a term, and God Himself is not simply the object of our worship. God is rich in every way. He is rich in glory and in all the divine attributes. He is rich in love, kindness, mercy, light, life, power, and strength. Oh, God’s riches are endless! Now this rich God is adding Himself into us. This is implied by the phrase, “grows with the growth of God.” God’s riches are the element and substance by which we grow. </p>

In the church as the new man, Christ is everything. This implies that He is every brother and every sister. This also implies that every brother and sister must be constituted of Christ. In the new man there cannot be Jewish members and Gentile members; there can only be Christ-members. If we would be constituted of Christ, Christ must be added into us more and more.

This section begins with a word of warning: “Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93402" data-verses="Colossians 2:8">v. 8</span>). This section is also followed by another warning: “Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93403" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">v. 16</span>). The warning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93404" data-verses="Colossians 2:8">verse 8</span> is based on the verses which precede it. According to these verses, Christ is the mystery of God, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93405" data-verses="Colossians 2:2-3">vv. 2-3</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93406" data-verses="Colossians 2:6">verse 6</span> Paul says that as we have received Christ, we should walk in Him. In order to walk in Christ, we must fulfill the two conditions mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93407" data-verses="Colossians 2:7">verse 7</span>: we must be rooted in Him and be in the process of being built up in Him. Then we must beware that no one carries us off as spoil from the very Christ who is the mystery of God and in whom we should walk.

It contains a number of important points. Many of these points are related to Christ as the good land, as the rich soil in which we have been rooted. The expression “having been rooted” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93409" data-verses="Colossians 2:7">verse 7</span> implies that there is soil. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93410" data-verses="Colossians 2:8-15">Verses 8 through 15</span> are a full description of Christ as the soil <span class="pg" data-page-id="462" id="462">[462]</span> in which we have been rooted. Having been rooted in the soil, we grow with the elements we absorb from the soil. We know that Christ as the soil is in our spirit. Now we must go on to see, from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93411" data-verses="Colossians 2:8-15">verses 8 through 15</span>, a description of the very soil in which we have been rooted. These verses present a full description and definition of the soil. </p>
<p data-content-id="LGGjP-PAOdJ8nFxUYQbpLuUqyAsMZ8ShMQZw72ekAlg3c478l-zKR4IjWE4Bf53rA"> The first aspect of this very special soil is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93412" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">verse 9</span>: “For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.” We have been rooted in the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily. We should not allow anyone to carry us away from such a soil. To be carried away from this soil is to be uprooted from it. When the book of Colossians was written, some were trying to uproot the believers from Christ. The believers had been rooted in Christ as the good land, as the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells. Instead of allowing anyone to carry us away from this soil, we must stay rooted in it. </p>
<p data-content-id="mLlsVgAIb-skAhfjqngkuMQKx-xugRA-Eh0Y8vVQpH3WrdTCEmNX27ibG0XFE_F6p"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93413" data-verses="Colossians 2:10">2:10</span> Paul continues, “And you in Him are made full, Who is the Head of all rule and authority.” Here we see more concerning the substance of Christ as the soil. One aspect of the soil is that of the fullness of the Godhead; another aspect is that Christ is the Head of all rule and authority. In Christ as the good land we have a number of different elements. The first element is all the fullness of the Godhead, and the second is the Head of all rule and authority. </p>
<p data-content-id="BOCvS1r-7tIB54EhOvqqTqjpyqEq6apvx43xAqzzl996JaIsWLw395nl-aNWe_mB3"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93414" data-verses="Colossians 2:11-15">verses 11 through 15</span> we find more elements. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93415" data-verses="Colossians 2:11">Verse 11</span> says, “In Whom also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.” The soil also includes the circumcision of Christ, which denotes cutting and killing. In the soil there is, therefore, a killing element. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93416" data-verses="Colossians 2:12">Verse 12</span>, which says that we were buried together with Christ in baptism, indicates that the soil also contains the element of burial. In Christ as the soil there is a substance which causes us to be buried. After burial, we are raised up. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93417" data-verses="Colossians 2:12">verse 12</span> Paul speaks of God who raised Christ from among the dead. This expression indicates that in Christ as the soil there is an element which causes us to be raised up. <span class="pg" data-page-id="463" id="463">[463]</span> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93418" data-verses="Colossians 2:13">verse 13</span>, we also are made alive. There is an element in the soil which gives us life, enlivens us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93419" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span> Paul speaks of the life-giving Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93420" data-verses="Colossians 2:13">Colossians 2:13</span> he uses the same Greek term for life-giving, only in the past tense. As the soil, Christ has made us alive; He has given us life. </p>
<p data-content-id="xhOwCJPMz8poSokM7QjIveWcSU1v-VtC3D97biFQx_aZezgsPp4uXJaG_Tl_jpc6R"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93421" data-verses="Colossians 2:14-15">verses 14 and 15</span> Paul continues, “Wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross. Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it.” Here we have more elements that are found in Christ as the soil. The wiping out of the handwriting in ordinances is an element in the soil. The same is true of the stripping off of the rulers and the authorities, the making of a display of them openly, and the triumphing over them in the cross. As the soil, Christ includes all these marvelous elements. Praise Him that He is such a rich soil! We have been rooted in this soil. Day by day, our roots need to sink deeper into Christ as the unique soil. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="riqDpjchUDoSOoMli_WZl-IixqsFEONu7gQhs2g1WdrF9hCb4rF0iMESoWGxdqC3t">MADE FULL IN CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="d9yHx1EHlCF0Nc2ISA4iR70qBZUB09jQsAr0x-_n5uKwoGhkDJWrhSt-NWfOCM6YO"> When we are rooted in Christ as the soil, the first thing to take place is that we are made full in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93422" data-verses="Colossians 2:10">2:10</span>). The phrase “made full” implies a great deal and requires an amplified translation in order to bring out its real significance. The Greek word implies completion, perfection, satisfaction, and full accomplishment. In Christ as the soil we are filled, completed, perfected, satisfied, and thoroughly supplied. We have pointed out that the first element of the soil is the fullness of the Godhead. As we absorb into our being the rich nourishment from the soil, we enjoy this fullness. Then this fullness makes us full, completes us, perfects us, satisfies us, accomplishes everything for us, and thoroughly supplies our every need. </p>
<p data-content-id="QoYPkMNcmTS0w0HcQG2WFMBh9iZNjfno00ymhHKS1B0KuZrfvJx-ndqeKB8A9ADgi"> At this point, we need to consider further the meaning of fullness. What is the fullness spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93423" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">2:9</span>? As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93424" data-verses="Colossians 1:1">Colossians 1</span> indicates, the fullness is the expression of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="464" id="464">[464]</span> This expression is related to the image of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93425" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">1:15</span>). As the image of the invisible God, Christ is both the Firstborn of all creation and also the Firstborn from among the dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93426" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">1:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93427" data-verses="Colossians 1:18">18</span>). The Godhead is expressed first in the old creation and then in the new creation, the church. Because all things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ, and because all things subsist together in Christ, there is the expression of the Godhead, the divine Being, in the old creation. The new creation is the church, the new man, in which Christ is all and in all (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93428" data-verses="Colossians 3:10-11">3:10-11</span>). The fullness of God is thus the expression of God in the old creation and in the new creation. This expression of God, the fullness of the divine Being, is the image of the invisible God. We have pointed out previously that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93429" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">1:15</span> the phrase “Firstborn of all creation” stands in apposition to the expression “image of the invisible God.” This indicates that the Firstborn of all creation is equal to the image of the invisible God. Christ is expressed in the items of the old creation. The same is true of the new creation, since Christ is the Firstborn from among the dead. Christ, the Beloved of God, is the image of the invisible God expressed in the old creation and in the new creation. This expression is the fullness of the Godhead. </p>
<p data-content-id="KavjviC-d0XiSiopL73LYAPbpwOJc-ycsRXMlBkeWvyXWct-X5tTcxic3H8-f0epm"> This fullness is inexhaustible. Such an inexhaustible fullness is the first element of the rich soil in which we are rooted. God has planted us into a rich land. The first aspect of this land is the fullness of the Godhead, the expression of God in the old creation and in the new creation. Thus, the fullness implies the expression of God in the old creation and in the new creation. Having been planted into such rich soil, we absorb nourishment from the soil. The first element of the riches of the soil is the fullness. In this fullness we have been made full. Thus, we are short of nothing. </p>

It is a fact that we are in Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93445" data-verses="Colossians 2:10">verse 10</span> Paul says, “And you in Him are made full.” In Christ we also have been circumcised, raised up, and made alive (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93446" data-verses="Colossians 2:11-12">vv. 11-12</span>). Paul’s writing is structured around the basic concept that everything is in Christ. If the expression “in Him” were removed from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93447" data-verses="Colossians 2:8-15">2:8-15</span>, the very structure of Paul’s composition would collapse. </p>
<p data-content-id="piRKMgn5tqXQZ3-2TvISTCkGNuA08DZjTePG4ht9Tcd7P32I3OUf8n-_v44p36SzH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93448" data-verses="Colossians 2:8">2:8</span> Paul says, “Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.” Notice the expression “according to Christ.” Paul’s desire is that we would all live and have our being according to Christ. To be led astray from Christ is to have our being according to something other than Christ, in particular the tradition of men and the elements of the world. These two matters cover everything that is not according to Christ. Today believers and unbelievers alike live, walk, behave, and have their being either according to the tradition of men or according to the elements of the world. It is very difficult to find a person who has his being according to Christ. Nevertheless, the Christian walk should be a walk according to Christ. We praise the Lord for all the riches we have in Christ. Now we must go on to live and have our being according to Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="472" id="472">[472]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vIx9uQjmeEwOiVEgDgH8y0xEeew0xfCCYgINrThFa0OoCG1Z0wmuhOJ40BCNUJHpK">FACTS AND EXPERIENCE</h2><p data-content-id="W0UKyOT0t1IBxSIccUYMsUMOgQLZ-P_JmT-k52DOjH1qiyrn6ODlKeTuGk-ooeEF4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93449" data-verses="Colossians 2:8-15">2:8-15</span> Paul lists a number of important spiritual facts. It is a fact that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. Christ is the Head of all rule and authority. We have been circumcised in Christ, buried in Him, raised up with Him, and made alive in Him. All these are facts. It is a fact that the ordinances in writing have been wiped out and that the powers of darkness have been stripped off. All these facts are related to the matter of what is in Christ. However, if these facts would become our experience, we must be not only in Christ, but also according to Christ. The expression “in Him” refers to the facts, whereas the expression “according to Christ” refers to experience. All those who are saved have the position of being in Christ. As saved ones, all the facts we have mentioned are ours. We have the right, the title deed, to all these facts. But whether or not our daily living is according to Christ is altogether another matter. We may have the assurance to declare that we are in Christ, but we probably do not have the boldness to say that our daily walk is according to Christ. Do you have the confidence to testify that your daily living is according to Christ? We are in Christ, but we do not have our being according to Christ. To a large degree, we live according to the tradition of men and the elements of the world. We have the facts, but we are short of experience. </p>

Now we need to walk in Him, having been rooted in Him and being built up in Him. After giving such a word, Paul charges us to beware that no one carries us off as spoil. Having seen the wonderful fact that we have received Christ as the mystery of God and have been rooted in Him, we must now take heed lest we be carried off from such a Christ. If you cannot say that you walk according to Christ, this indicates that, in a practical way, you have been carried off from Him. You have received <span class="pg" data-page-id="473" id="473">[473]</span> Christ and have been rooted in Him, but as far as your daily living is concerned, you have been carried away from Him. To fail to have our daily walk according to Christ means that we are severed from Christ. As long as we are severed from Christ, it does not matter whether we are far removed from Him or only a little bit away from Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="mLlsVgAIb-skAhfjqngkuMQKx_BuoDw-Eh0Y8vVQpH3WrdTCEmNX27ibG0XFE_F6p"> For the most part, our daily walk is according to the tradition of men and the elements of the world and not according to Christ. Tradition is the main component of culture. Without tradition, culture could not exist. We inherit culture from the traditional practices of our family, society, and country. Spontaneously and unconsciously, we live according to the cultural traditions we have inherited. Furthermore, we live according to the elements of the world, that is, the elementary principles of culture. Traditions are the practices of culture, whereas the elements are the basic principles of culture. Even we who love Christ and seek after Him are still dominated by these two things. I hate any aspect of my daily living that is according to the tradition of men or the elements of the world and not according to Christ. I do not want to have my being according to Chinese tradition or according to the ethical teaching of Confucius. Many times I have prayed, “Lord, forgive me for living according to the tradition of men instead of according to Christ.” God’s desire is that we walk according to Christ. For example, a sister may be very submissive, following either the teaching of the Bible or an ethical standard that is according to her culture. Such submission, however, may not be according to Christ. God does not want any behavior that is not according to Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZIaYAIUhlPYkrS-W4qNUAjewQcO-Mf35Enf7GKa9aNGLCeSPPJyL_qRbhaKXPVpri"> Many saints, after they have been in the church for a period of time, begin to walk according to what may be called the local church way of life. In a sense, the church life refines our humanity. The humanity of those in the local churches is very high. However, it is possible for us to walk according to our refined humanity and not according to Christ. Instead of living Christ, we may conform to certain standards or practices. For example, a sister who has been in the church life for a while may decide to stop using makeup. But her <span class="pg" data-page-id="474" id="474">[474]</span> decision may not necessarily be made according to Christ. Instead of walking according to Christ in this matter, she may simply be conforming to the local church way of life. Another example is that of a brother who chooses to have short hair instead of long hair. If this brother were not in the church life, he might prefer to have his hair long. But because he is in the church, he chooses to wear his hair short. In this matter, however, he also may be conforming to a certain way of life instead of living according to Christ. In the church life, we should not be conformists; we should live, walk, and have our being according to Christ. God’s intention is not to have a group of clean, neat, refined people. His desire is to have a group of people who have their being according to Christ. It is not sufficient just to be in Christ; we must also walk according to Christ. To be in Christ is a matter of position, but to walk according to Christ is a matter of experience. We should dress ourselves and style our hair according to Christ, not according to the tradition of men or the elements of the world. </p>
<p data-content-id="A9Ho75-1IEWiI5pZAWtoolFIHFaNq_gDjip1OYh6Z3Q5wGMSc15rgkFYdiHX9QQ7d"> God’s desire is that our daily walk be according to Christ. As long as we do not live according to Christ, we have been carried off from Him. Just as even a thin piece of insulation can stop the flow of electricity, so even the slightest separation from Christ can cause us to be carried away from Him. There is no need to indulge in worldly things in order to be carried off from Christ. Even if you attend the church meetings without walking according to Christ, you will be separated from Him in a practical way. In the matter of being carried off from Christ, you are no different from Christians who indulge in worldly entertainments. We have been saved, regenerated, and rooted in the all-inclusive and extensive Christ. However, it is very easy for us to be carried off from Him. Where are the Christians today who truly walk according to Christ and not according to man’s tradition? Virtually all believers have been carried away from Christ and live according to some kind of tradition. Where are those Christians who live simply, solely, and uniquely according to Christ? <span class="pg" data-page-id="475" id="475">[475]</span> </p>

The word of God simply would not be complete. The divine revelation was completed through the ministry of Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="J_nFMNQorB6p2GT8JBzVIJEJkg9RPLNHJ9mfOn7jgTGQpHDcX8vywWDQZdhqUypmp"> Of all the books written by Paul, the ultimate book, the consummate book, is Colossians. This book is filled with matters which are high and profound. We may compare it to a gold mine filled with riches to be dug out. </p>

He is universally extensive. This is indicated by the fact that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93462" data-verses="Colossians 2:16-17">2:16 and 17</span> He is presented as the body, the substance, of all the shadows. Christ is the reality of all the positive things in the universe. This makes Him extensive as well as all-inclusive. </p>
<p data-content-id="bII_pa96wW65xpS_TOga8Qb0p12g9PkpsR-fiE2GZ2XncQE7FKuNnsp2sqi-cXeIt"> According to the revelation in the book of Colossians, the extensive, all-inclusive Christ is everything to us. Although Christ is universally extensive, He should be our daily experience. We should experience Him in our daily living and in our daily walk. The extensive, all-inclusive Christ must become real, practical, and experiential to us day by day. On the one hand, in Colossians Paul presents the revelation of <span class="pg" data-page-id="480" id="480">[480]</span> the extensive Christ. But on the other hand, he speaks of our experience of such a Christ in a detailed way. </p>
<p data-content-id="4IBzwnFeZUmiPTldQylpqjfn67kuxJheAumWT0F5vBeYLZvZUxnAH8UtbPcg2OgXO"> Concerning the revelation of Christ, Paul uses terms such as “image of the invisible God,” “Firstborn of all creation,” “Firstborn from among the dead,” “the mystery of God.” But concerning our daily experience of Christ, Paul speaks of such common, ordinary matters as eating and drinking (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93463" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">2:16</span>). Even in such matters we need to experience Christ. For example, you may experience Christ as you are enjoying a cup of tea or even a glass of water. If we ask ourselves whether or not we enjoy Christ in the small matters of our daily living, we shall realize that we are short of experience. If you do not enjoy Christ in your eating and drinking, and if you do not enjoy Christ as the real clothing while you are dressing yourself, you have been defrauded of your prize of the enjoyment of Christ. This is an extremely serious matter. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="omf13Bx02SFTK6-4sHpHdKgUwbGji-SgyrvnjZRmemRqzlC_dbZvNK2s_tofFhghm">DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY,<br/>AND YEARLY ENJOYMENT</h2><p data-content-id="3UjYSiEHFuVk3dorn6OJHP8Sw-NjF-TE1JDXU4fE-zxmVMphWG74zhUcdZ0bQV1Uw"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93464" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">Colossians 2:16</span> says, “Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths.” In writing these words Paul wisely refers to matters related to our daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly enjoyment. Eating and drinking are daily matters, keeping the Sabbath is a weekly matter, observing the new moon is a monthly matter, and enjoying certain feasts is a yearly matter. In referring to these matters, Paul indicates that whatever we enjoy daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly should be the enjoyment of Christ. Otherwise, we are being defrauded of Christ and carried away from Him. For example, when you eat your lunch, you need to realize that your physical food is a shadow of Christ as the real food. Christ is the body, the substance, of this shadow. We should know this not only doctrinally, but also experientially. When you are invited to go to a restaurant for a meal, you should not go there only to enjoy the shadow, but go to enjoy Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="481" id="481">[481]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="GpAIfwI6Fm0o_bJAzhxAk04CUrNspFfbvl-wOzBXDm09fW-1mBX4cRfsZbOTdf_Bp"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93465" data-verses="Colossians 2:16-17">2:16-17</span>, material things are a shadow of Christ. The “things to come” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93466" data-verses="Colossians 2:17">verse 17</span> are the things concerning Christ as our enjoyment. Thus, Christ is the body, the substance, the reality, of all the shadows. As such, He must be the reality of our daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="c33eAwsfVfXraWL3f3puOBKwrfaxS-tqYFcEXib3Lo6hB_NVq0ahbWwl2qspOIzbJ"> It is significant that after speaking of Christ as the body of the shadows, Paul goes on to say, “Let no one purposely defraud you of your prize” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93467" data-verses="Colossians 2:18">v. 18</span>). According to the context, the prize is the enjoyment of Christ as the body of the shadows. The enjoyment of Christ is truly a prize. </p>

Both paid a price in turning to Christ. Having paid a price, they could receive the enjoyment of Christ as their prize. Both the Jewish and Gentile believers had suffered much because of their faith in Christ. Therefore, they could have the subjective enjoyment of Christ as their prize. The same is true of us today. Many saints have suffered persecution because they have turned to Christ and to the way of the Lord’s recovery. But now they may enjoy Christ as their reward, as their prize. This prize is not only the objective Christ, but in particular it is the subjective enjoyment of Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93468" data-verses="Colossians 2:16-17">Colossians 2:16 and 17</span> indicate this. These verses reveal that Christ is not only objective, but that He is also the One for us to enjoy daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. The Christ we experience daily in matters of eating and drinking is a very subjective Christ. The same is true of the Christ we experience as our weekly completion and rest (the Sabbath), as a new beginning in darkness (the new moon), and as our yearly enjoyment (the feasts). Therefore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93469" data-verses="Colossians 2:18">verse 18</span>, to be defrauded of our prize is to be deprived of the subjective enjoyment of Christ. Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly we should enjoy Christ. We should not allow anyone to defraud us of this prize. <span class="pg" data-page-id="482" id="482">[482]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="DoDlSswZom_4i2OTnuzO3QHEB5cZ3TZ-vevsKnj9CyhxI_r5snfUvFBDoS7HJ6EHS"> The Colossian believers, however, were being defrauded of their prize of the enjoyment of Christ. The Jewish believers were distracted from Christ by the Judaizers, whereas the Gentile believers were carried off by certain philosophical concepts. Both were defrauded of the daily experience and enjoyment of Christ. Furthermore, they had lost the weekly, monthly, and yearly enjoyment of Him. This indicates that the Jewish and Gentile believers alike had been led astray, deprived of the very prize for which they had paid such a price. As we have indicated again and again, this prize is the subjective experience of Christ daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sr4B7OdLi_gaxbmxLXiEYa2SV26IHpPLZGWdu23POQDxs7Xqf3z_YUMIa59gSQKwD"> We need to check whether we experience and enjoy Christ in a practical way daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. It is very possible that we, like the Colossians, have also been defrauded of our prize. Satan, the Devil, may defraud us of Christ, and we may not even realize it. Once I had my briefcase, which contained my passport, stolen from beside my chair while I was talking to someone in an airline company office. However, at the time of the theft I did not realize what was happening. I was defrauded of my briefcase, but I was totally unconscious of the fact. In like manner, we may not be conscious of the fact that the enemy has deprived us of the enjoyment of Christ. We may have lost the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly enjoyment of Christ and not even realize it. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ggDaF55GyBbxJPqPBphLCbZaePRKd2QCTqIDR3goq-SVfvSN8prg0TR811vkyUmRZ">BACK TO CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="ebF32ctwP_e7REaxpIcbMtYbaoofI9sLDYsGl3bv4T3pP5hTy7t2LO_iBZ3Z1dSVZ"> In His recovery the Lord is bringing us back from religion and everything other than Christ to Himself. God’s economy is to dispense Himself into us for our enjoyment. God wants Christ to be not only our Savior and not even just our life, but also to be our daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly enjoyment. But as we consider the situation among the vast majority of Christians today, we see that this enjoyment has been lost. Instead of enjoying Christ, believers are occupied with religion, so-called worship services, and theological teaching. There is very little enjoyment of Christ in a practical and <span class="pg" data-page-id="483" id="483">[483]</span> living way. No doubt it is necessary for the Lord to have a recovery. We need to be brought back to Christ Himself. In particular, we need to be recovered to the continual enjoyment of Christ in a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly way. </p>
<p data-content-id="5znjdl0RibbATJcKH_ecb09_ncRFsEgnNfuxNd8ItWQaf-xO-QYNQQKXpfnLolJRo"> My burden is not to give more messages on doctrine. My concern is that the saints experience Christ in a practical way. If such is not our situation, then we have subtly been defrauded of Christ as our prize by the enemy. We need to enjoy Christ in all the small details of our daily living. </p>

<p data-content-id="riqDpjchUDoSOoMli_WZl-Iixr8FNcNu7gQhs2g1WdrF9hCb4rF0iMESoWGxdqC3t"> To understand properly what it means to hold the Head, we need to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93485" data-verses="Colossians 2:16-17">2:16 and 17</span>, where Paul tells us that Christ is the body, the substance, the reality, of all the shadows. Eating, <span class="pg" data-page-id="490" id="490">[490]</span> drinking, Sabbaths, new moons, and feasts are all shadows of things to come, whereas Christ is the body, the reality, of these shadows. Based upon this fact, Paul warns us not to allow anyone to purposely defraud us of our prize. His warning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93486" data-verses="Colossians 2:18-19">2:18 and 19</span> is based upon the fact, revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93487" data-verses="Colossians 2:16-17">verses 16 and 17</span>, that Christ is the reality of all positive things. Those who seek to defraud us are the ones who stand on things which they have seen and who do not hold the Head. Thus, there is a connection between Christ as the body of the shadows and holding the Head. In other words, the very Christ who is the reality of all positive things is the One who is the Head of the Body. If we would know what it means to hold the Head, we must know what it is to enjoy Christ as the reality of all positive things. Without enjoying Christ in this way, we cannot experientially hold Him as the Head. With this as the background, we can now say that to hold the Head is simply to enjoy Christ as the reality of all positive things. </p>
<p data-content-id="d9yHx1EHlCF0Nc2ISA4iR70qBYEB8vzQsAr0x-_n5uKwoGhkDJWrhSt-NWfOCM6YO"> The genuine Christian life is a life of enjoying Christ. We need to enjoy the Lord all day long. We have seen that in speaking of eating, drinking, Sabbaths, new moons, and feasts Paul refers to matters of daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly enjoyment. Actually, we eat and drink several times a day. In Paul’s use of illustrations in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93488" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">2:16</span>, he covers the whole span from the hourly enjoyment of Christ to the yearly enjoyment of Him. This indicates that we should enjoy Christ continually. When I drink a glass of water, I should remember to drink Christ. When I eat my food, I should enjoy Christ as the real food. Whenever we enjoy Christ in this way, we automatically hold Him as the Head. Thus, the best way to hold Christ as the Head is to enjoy Him. There is no better way to hold Christ than to eat Him. Just as we hold food by taking it into us and eating it, so we hold Christ by eating Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="piRKMgn5tqXQZ3-2TvISTCkGNug07R5jTePG4ht9Tcd7P32I3OUf8n-_v44p36SzH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93489" data-verses="Colossians 2:16-19">2:16-19</span>, Paul takes a great leap, from Christ as everything for our enjoyment, which is on the ground floor, to Christ as the Head, which is the top floor of our experience. As we enjoy Christ as food, drink, air, and everything to us, we are uplifted by a divine elevator to the very height, <span class="pg" data-page-id="491" id="491">[491]</span> where we hold Christ as the Head. But if we stop enjoying Christ, we immediately stop holding Him as the Head. Only when we enjoy Him do we also hold Him. This is not a doctrine learned from theology books. It is a fact of Christian experience. From my experience throughout the years I have learned that to hold the Head is to enjoy Christ continually. We are vessels made to contain Him, and we hold Him by eating, drinking, and breathing Him. By this we see that holding Christ as the Head is a very subjective matter. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vIx9uQjmeEwOiVEgDgH8y0xEeeQ03NyCYgINrThFa0OoCG1Z0wmuhOJ40BCNUJHpK">BODY-CONSCIOUS</h2><p data-content-id="W0UKyOT0t1IBxSIccUYMsUMOgQrZ3d_JmT-k52DOjH1qiyrn6ODlKeTuGk-ooeEF4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93490" data-verses="Colossians 2:17">2:17</span> Paul says that the body is of Christ, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93491" data-verses="Colossians 2:19">verse 19</span> he speaks not of Christ, but of holding the Head. The reason for the change in terminology from Christ to the Head is that our enjoyment of the Lord causes us to become conscious of the Body. If we are those who enjoy Christ continually, we shall not continue to be individualistic. The saints who are individualistic are those who do not consistently enjoy the Lord. The more we enjoy Christ, the more we become Body-conscious. We should touch the Lord in the morning, but in the evening we should come to the church meetings. It is not normal to enjoy the Lord during the day and neglect the meetings of the church, which is His Body. Even if your environment does not allow you to attend all the meetings, inwardly you should have the sense that your whole inner being is with the saints in the church meeting. This consciousness of the Body comes from the enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="2KhgJ0DuKwQnI2lO6O2N5dgXrfbpahtkMP3qeHnY675TwiRdcLBNxgl-yEWidZOr3"> What we enjoy of Christ day by day is actually something of Him as the Head. This is the reason that when we enjoy Christ, He causes us to become conscious of the Body. According to our experience, we know that the more we enjoy Christ, the more intense is our desire for the Body. However, if we fail to contact the Lord for a period of time, we shall automatically neglect the church life or lose interest in the meetings. The less we contact the Lord, the more critical we become of the church or of the saints. We have an eye for the faults and shortcomings of others. This shortage of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="492" id="492">[492]</span> enjoyment of Christ opens the door for the enemy, Satan, to come in to make us critical of other members of the Body. But if we begin again to enjoy the Lord, the door will gradually close. Eventually, if we are constant in our enjoyment of Christ, the door will be completely shut. Then, instead of criticizing the church, we shall praise the Lord for the church life, and we shall testify how much we love it. What brings about such a change is not admonition or correction, but the recovery of the enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="uei5QW3MGv90tAA2FxD3LJZffMH-F5R75QFjeBrVrSzVrCFjdoepppbzqxBliOuF8"> The dear, precious One whom we enjoy as our food, drink, and breath, is the Head of the Body. Because Paul had a thorough realization of this, he could leap from Christ as the reality of all positive things for our enjoyment to the matter of Christ as the Head. Since the Christ we enjoy as our everything is the Head of the Body, the more we enjoy Him, the more we become Body-conscious. This indicates that the enjoyment of Christ is not an individualistic matter. It is a Body matter. We need to enjoy Christ as members of the Body in a corporate way. </p>

The more we enjoy Christ, the more we love the other members of the Body. The enjoyment of Christ causes us to love everyone in the church life. Even those whom we find it difficult to love become dear and precious to us. However, if we do not keep on enjoying Christ, we shall despise certain ones in the church. Actually, the church and the saints remain the same; it is our attitude that changes. But if the supply of Christ is ministered to us and we begin to enjoy Him again, all the members of the Body will once again become lovable to us. We shall have the pleasant realization that, as members of the Body, we love all the other members. </p>

Now that we have received such a Christ, we should walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him. To walk in Christ is to have our living and our being in Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93504" data-verses="Colossians 2:9-10">2:9 and 10</span> Paul goes on to say that in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily and that we in Him have been made full. In Christ we have been completed, perfected, supplied, and satisfied. Furthermore, in Christ we were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, we were buried with Him in baptism, and we were also raised together in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93505" data-verses="Colossians 2:11-12">vv. 11-12</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93506" data-verses="Colossians 2:14-15">verses 14 and 15</span>, the handwriting in ordinances which was against us has been wiped out, and the rulers and authorities have been stripped off.

The first element of this soil is the fullness of the Godhead. Other elements include circumcision, burial, being raised, the wiping out of the ordinances, and the stripping off of the powers of darkness. Since we have been rooted in Christ, we may now absorb all these rich elements into our being. <span class="pg" data-page-id="498" id="498">[498]</span> </p>

Paul also said that we are God’s farm, God’s plantation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93508" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">1 Cor. 3:9</span>, Gk.). We have been planted into Christ who is the good land with very rich soil. </p>

The matters in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93511" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">verse 16</span>—eating, drinking, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths—are all shadows, of which Christ is the reality, the substance. The “things to come” are the things related to Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93512" data-verses="Colossians 2:18-19">verses 18 through 19</span> Paul speaks of not being defrauded of our prize and of holding the Head. We have pointed out that, experientially and practically, to hold the Head is to enjoy Christ as the reality of all positive things. The result of holding the Head in this way is that we become Body-conscious. Whatever we enjoy of Christ is related to Him as the Head. This is why, when we enjoy Christ, we are actually holding the Head. We enjoy Christ as food, drink, Sabbaths, new moons, and feasts. But the Christ we enjoy in all these aspects is the Head who causes us to become conscious of the Body. The One we enjoy is not only Christ to us; He is the Head of the Body. Therefore, the issue, the consequence, of enjoying Christ and holding Him as the Head is Body-consciousness. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ggDaF55GyBbxJPqPBphLCbZaePxKd0QCTqIDR3goq-SVfvSN8prg0TR811vkyUmRZ">CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="ebF32ctwP_e7REaxpIcbMtYbaoIfL9MLDYsGl3bv4T3pP5hTy7t2LO_iBZ3Z1dSVZ"> To enjoy Christ, holding Him as the Head, is to absorb into us the rich elements of Christ as the soil. Two of these elements are the experience of having died with Christ and of having been raised with Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93513" data-verses="Colossians 2:20">2:20</span> Paul indicates that we have “died with Christ from the elements of the world,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93514" data-verses="Colossians 3:1">3:1</span> he says that we were “raised together with Christ.” The New Testament clearly says that we have been crucified with Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93515" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Rom. 6:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93516" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>). When I was a young believer, I tried my best to figure out how this could be true. How could we have died with Christ when He was <span class="pg" data-page-id="499" id="499">[499]</span> crucified more than nineteen hundred years ago? Certain books point out that when Christ was crucified, He included us. Brother Nee used <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93517" data-verses="Hebrews 7:1">Hebrews 7</span> to illustrate this. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93518" data-verses="Hebrews 7:9-10">Hebrews 7:9 and 10</span>, “Levi also, who receives tithes, has been made to pay tithes; for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him.” This means that when Abraham offered one-tenth to Melchisedec, Levi, the descendant of Abraham, who was in Abraham’s loins at the time, also offered tithes. If Abraham had died childless, Levi would have died also. This illustration helped me to see how we were included in Christ when He was crucified. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5znjdl0RibbATJcKH_ecb09_ncxFvEAnNfuxNd8ItWQaf-xO-QYNQQKXpfnLolJRo">EXPERIENCING OUR CRUCIFIXION WITH CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="NvL9nhfr9y1MfkuCnJjWc5-mGnAZRIH-02hvDSNt9dQdENu8DeMorULDAd59B1LCF"> Seeking for further help in understanding the fact of our crucifixion with Christ, I read books which encouraged me to reckon myself dead. However, in my experience reckoning did not work. The more I tried to reckon myself dead, the more alive I became. Years later, my eyes were opened to see that the very Christ who was crucified on the cross became in resurrection the life-giving Spirit. When we believed in Christ, the life-giving Spirit came into our spirit. Now the two spirits are one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93519" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). Whenever we call “Lord Jesus,” the life-giving Spirit comes. This indicates that Jesus is the name and the Spirit is the Person. The Spirit as this Person is now in our spirit. Whatever He has experienced is now our history. He has passed through crucifixion and has entered into resurrection. Having come into our spirit to make us one with Him, He causes even these experiences to become our history. Hence, it is in the spirit that we participate in Christ’s death on the cross. This is not a matter of reckoning; it is a matter of union, of identification. When the Spirit came into us to become one with us, the Spirit brought with Him the effectiveness of Christ’s death. Therefore, through the compound Spirit in our spirit, we participate in the death of Christ. Day by day, we may experience the effectiveness of Christ’s death. </p>
<p data-content-id="t5iqp8-G4gD5mGLTCIR_DHqa_Tsd6sluKEbpWrQpW1yZ_muRMBVOIaTGcMROMFrnI"> The compound, life-giving Spirit is an all-inclusive drink containing many elements. By drinking the Spirit, we <span class="pg" data-page-id="500" id="500">[500]</span> spontaneously take in all the elements included in the Spirit. The effectiveness of Christ’s death is one of the elements in this Spirit. This is what enables us to experience Christ’s crucifixion. As the Head, Christ today is the all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit. In order to hold Him as the Head, we must be in spirit. </p>

Abiding in the vine is equal to being rooted in the soil, and being rooted in the soil is equal to holding the Head. On the one hand, Christ is the vine in which we abide; on the other hand, He is the soil in which we are rooted. But He is also the Head. Christ is the vine, the soil, and the Head. We abide in Him as the vine, we are rooted in Him as the soil, and we hold Him as the Head. In every case the principle is the same: we absorb Christ’s riches into us. As branches, we absorb the life juice from the vine; as plants, we absorb the riches of the soil; as members of the Body of Christ, we absorb the nourishing element from the Head. By absorbing the riches of the Head, the Body grows with the growth of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93522" data-verses="Colossians 2:19">2:19</span>). As we have indicated, the riches we absorb include crucifixion, being buried, and being raised up with Christ. When we hold Christ as the Head, we absorb all these elements into us. </p>

In only four chapters he presents many riches. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93550" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">1:12</span> he indicates that Christ is the portion of the saints. The One who is our portion is the image of the invisible God, Firstborn of all creation and also the Firstborn from among the dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93551" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">1:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93552" data-verses="Colossians 1:18">18</span>). Paul also tells us that Christ is the mystery of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93553" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">2:2</span>) and that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93554" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">2:9</span>). As the mystery of God and the embodiment of the Godhead, He is the reality, the body, the substance, of all positive things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93555" data-verses="Colossians 2:16-17">2:16-17</span>). The more we enjoy Him as this reality, the more we hold Him as the Head of the Body and thereby become Body-conscious. Then we shall experience Him as our life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93556" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">3:4</span>) and as the constituent of the new man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93557" data-verses="Colossians 3:10-11">3:10-11</span>). In the new man, Christ is all the members and in all the members. In this Epistle Paul mentions all these great matters without defining them. However, he does indicate that those of us who enjoy Christ and partake of Him, those who are being constituted into members of the new man, have our life hidden with Him in God. Now we should seek the things which are above and set our mind on them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="508" id="508">[508]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="h3ZNAj-7-mNpWfPCijhB17Zq4ObLABqT5I-hwnsewSx8Ec6pwTMhh2r5WyeY8HZbS"> Although Paul charges us to seek the things above and set our mind on them, in Colossians he does not define what these things are. However, in other New Testament books, namely, Hebrews, Ephesians, and Revelation, there are some windows through which we can see into the heavens and come to know what is taking place there. If we look through these windows, we shall know what are the things above. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="U-smkr1a6dFJm6oEW-7auOkFj8nXWaVwUVyMfwU3YgBr5P5j6Up1AlI-ogYff8uiJ">FROM THE FULLNESS TO THE NEW MAN</h2><p data-content-id="XqFwK4-uCOxRvgyEbG31TFRJaCHgOx1v26KaLLx9rvafbSffqSmEd1W12EaU8vYF3"> Paul and John wrote along very similar lines. In Colossians Paul presents the Christ who is the fullness of the invisible God. After mentioning aspect after aspect of such a Christ, he speaks of the new man. Between Christ as the fullness of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93558" data-verses="Colossians 1:1">chapter one</span> and the new man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93559" data-verses="Colossians 3:1">chapter three</span> we have the experience of Christ and the enjoyment of Him. The issue of our experience and enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ is the church as the new man. Hence, the new man comes out of our enjoyment of Christ as the fullness of God. As we enjoy Christ daily, He is wrought into us, constituted into our very being. In this way, Christ becomes our constituent. Day by day, Christ is being constituted into us. Eventually, we all shall be thoroughly constituted of Him. As a result of being constituted of Christ, we become the new man. In this new man there is no place for any natural person; there is room only for Christ. Christ is all and in all in the new man. To repeat, in the new man Christ is all the members and is in all the members. </p>
<p data-content-id="kX1nUfZuqQkzrLrgt3NFkih8iCxwQ3eJ9RDPm9pQmA9VJDK3iAAZbqak9qWDfH_Sw"> The only way Christ can be all and in all in the new man is for Him to constitute Himself into us. The process of being constituted of Christ takes place through our enjoyment of Christ. We need to say, “Lord Jesus, I love You, I treasure You, and I enjoy You. Lord, I am here on earth for You and for You alone.” The more we open to the Lord and contact Him in this way, the more He infuses Himself into us and fills us to the brim. As we call on the Lord, praise Him, and offer Him our thanks and adoration, we are filled with Him. Through such an enjoyment of Christ and experience <span class="pg" data-page-id="509" id="509">[509]</span> of Him, we are gradually constituted of Christ. It is as we enjoy Him that He constitutes us of Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="J_nFMNQorB6p2GT8JBzVIJEJkjtRIZNHJ9mfOn7jgTGQpHDcX8vywWDQZdhqUypmp"> Eating and digesting food is a good illustration of how Christ is constituted into our being through our enjoyment of Him. Through a process of digestion and assimilation, the food we eat becomes part of our constitution. If we realize this, we shall be careful of what we eat. Some dietitians say that we are what we eat. If we eat an extraordinary amount of any one particular food, we shall become a constitution of the elements of that food. Years ago, I noticed that the daughter of our family doctor in Taiwan had developed a yellowish complexion. The doctor explained that this coloring was the result of eating too many carrots. His daughter had eaten so many carrots that she was eventually constituted of them to the point that it affected the color of her skin. This case is evidence of the fact that the food we eat becomes our constitution. The principle is the same in our experience of Christ. As we enjoy Him by eating Him, He is constituted into us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="zxxKVZo0L_3UdrO9iX46TdlvwllHq_fB11uoqtjPBjhY_rEsDeSQDqGrA0qATN0ay">A HEAVENLY TRANSMISSION</h2><p data-content-id="aw_owglmYsbhVQpnqDeZZJvwXjFpyJPcebdjcPDhLYFI9FSkEF8RpLBEHkqv-h5U3"> At this point we may ask how we can enjoy Christ and have Him constituted into us when He is in heaven and we are on earth. The answer lies in the fact that there is a transmission taking place from Christ in heaven to us on earth by means of the all-inclusive Spirit. By means of this transmission, the electricity from the heavenly power plant flows into us, just as electricity flows from the power plant into our homes and into the meeting hall. Hallelujah for the transmission from the third heaven into us! “There’s a Man in the glory Whose Life is for me” (<em>Hymns,</em> #505). Christ is the Man in the glory, but His life is for us. We all need a vision of the heavenly transmission from the glorified Christ into us. Furthermore, we need to stay open to this transmission so that it will not be cut off. Even a small amount of insulation will cause this transmission to cease. Between Christ as the fullness of God and the one new man, there is our experience of the heavenly transmission. May there be no insulation to hinder this divine transmission. <span class="pg" data-page-id="510" id="510">[510]</span> </p>

Of this fullness we have all received grace upon grace. Ultimately, the issue of our receiving of Christ’s fullness will be the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem revealed through John’s ministry will be the ultimate consummation of the new man revealed through Paul’s ministry. On the one hand, Paul begins with the fullness and goes to the new man; on the other hand, John goes from the fullness to the New Jerusalem. </p>

The first aspect of the things above is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93561" data-verses="Hebrews 2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>. According to this verse, we see Jesus crowned with glory and honor. On earth, He was crowned with thorns. But on the throne in heaven, He is crowned with glory and honor. As the One crowned with glory and honor, Christ is far more precious than Judaism or Greek philosophy. To set our mind on such things is to set it on “the things which are on the earth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93562" data-verses="Colossians 3:2">Col. 3:2</span>). Judaism and Greek philosophy are things on the earth. Let us look away from these things and look to the resurrected and ascended Jesus who is enthroned and crowned with glory and honor. Since we have been raised with Christ, we should seek the things above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93563" data-verses="Colossians 3:1">3:1</span>). Let us forget our natural virtues and look at the Lord Jesus. Instead of appreciating our natural attributes and character, we need to appreciate the One crowned with glory and honor. According to Paul, our attention must be concentrated on the Lord Jesus. We should not be attracted by anything else. </p>

Because we and Christ have one position, we are where He is. We and Christ also have one life, even the same life. The life He has we have also. Moreover, we have one living with Christ. Our living is His living. When we live, He lives, for He lives in our living. If we have one living with Christ in a practical way day by day, then whatever we do, He does also. This means that when we talk, He talks. If we do something different from what Christ is doing, we do not have one living with Him. For example, if we become angry and Christ is not angry, we do not have one living with Him at that particular time. In such a case, our living is not His living. We should refrain from losing our temper not because we are trying to obey a biblical command, but because we sense that the Christ who lives in us is not losing His temper. If we simply try to control our temper, we are religious. But if we do not lose our temper because we are living with Christ, then we are one with Him in life and in living. Praise the Lord that we have one position, life, and living with Christ! </p>
<p data-content-id="Twq0tWAMk6bVuZEt9Z9lD5HOCT4TW_odL3jAfCQiy5hBnTJuAz_YAL8NdDTj2RtGV"> We also have one glory and destiny with Christ. Glory is our future and our destination. The Lord Jesus is now in glory. However, He is in glory in a way that is hidden from mankind. If you ask the people in the world where Jesus is, they will reply that they do not know. But we know where He is—He is in glory. One day Christ will be in glory no longer in a hidden way, but in an open way, in the way of <span class="pg" data-page-id="518" id="518">[518]</span> manifestation. Then everyone on earth will know that the Lord Jesus is in glory. Christ’s destiny is to be openly in glory. This is our destiny as well. We can say, “Glory is our destination. We are heading for glory. Our destiny is not simply heaven—it is to be in glory.” Since glory is our destination, we shall eventually have one glory with Christ. It is not possible for us to describe this glory now because we have not yet entered into it. I believe, however, that when we are in glory, we shall be beside ourselves with joy and ecstasy. We may want to dance, shout, and praise the Lord. In glory we shall realize how exciting our God is. When we are in glory with Christ, we shall be excited also. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nAAjrYoSxORsKcXED0Y92nk_jMW8YQbYu242cBU-V2b50Voz0s71JJrl7esVgPqMx">IN CHRIST, IN THE FATHER, IN HEAVEN</h2><p data-content-id="6lc_KG4lpSEXBWvOfF9n73K2CQdBoPqSbKVHRXhoCGalmrzef-H9gsKXflDUdQgSY"> Our position is that we are in Christ. Because we are in Him, we are where He is—at the right hand of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93587" data-verses="Colossians 3:1">3:1</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93588" data-verses="John 17:24">John 17:24</span> the Lord Jesus prayed, “Father, I desire that those whom You have given Me may also be with Me where I am.” To be where the Lord Jesus is, is not a matter of geography. The Lord is in the Father, and He prayed that the disciples, who were not yet in the Father, would be brought into Him. The Lord prayed, therefore, that they would be where He is. </p>
<p data-content-id="RfNO2lIzA5Rw54npqQTHNA_TPg86W9wgvd8yXLZ0NJhLX6FOEZQflozxR78uf33Oy"> It is crucial for us to realize that our position is not only in Christ, but also in the Father. In the Gospel of John we are told clearly that the Son is in the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93589" data-verses="John 10:38">10:38</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93590" data-verses="John 14:10">14:10</span>). This means that the Son’s position is in the Father. Since our position today is that we are in the Son, in Christ, we also are in the Father. The Father, of course, is in heaven. Hence, our position also is that we are in heaven. In saying this, however, we have a different understanding from that held by many Christians. Often when Christians say that we shall be in heaven, they mean that we shall be in heaven outside the Father. But when we say that we shall be in heaven, we mean that we shall be in heaven in the Father. There is a great difference here. We are in Christ, in the Father, and therefore in heaven. <span class="pg" data-page-id="519" id="519">[519]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MbvcrlXtA4GGPOZNOvDot4_k-J0O4_YWsRhB1iUfY2NjrQ3EE-RVlAKh7NIKw-9kI">EXPERIENCING THE HEAVENLY TRANSMISSION</h2><p data-content-id="Vehc_DxwcgXUMWVvg6ZqRxQAY_mkSIcmilbKcMYbZp13kc_c_BsTJjIrnVSGak81f"> If we stop here, we shall have nothing more than a mere doctrinal understanding of our one position with Christ. We shall only know the fact that we are in Christ, in the Father, and in heaven. What makes this real is that we are one spirit with the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93591" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). It is when we are in the spirit that we are in Christ, in the Father, and in heaven practically and experientially. </p>
<p data-content-id="iiCXRFpuXcPrT8Ib2ei9Wmk1CmZyhf2ws6tpqdIZHirz4qBni4rQoR_fScofdndKl"> Consider as an illustration how the lights in the meeting hall are connected to the power plant by the flow of electricity. Apart from this electrical flow, the lights are related only to the meeting hall, not to the power plant. But by the flow of electrical current, they are connected to the power plant. Likewise, by the transmission we experience in our spirit, we are connected to the heavenly power plant. Praise the Lord that a transmission is going on from heaven to our spirit! When we experience this transmission, we are truly in Christ, in the Father, and in heaven. Our spirit is directly related to heaven. The heavenly transmission begins in heaven and ends in our spirit. Because we may experience and enjoy this unique transmission, there is no need for us to go to heaven in order to be in heaven. Simply by being in our spirit where we experience the transmission from heaven, we are in heaven. Just as the lights in the meeting hall are connected to the power plant by the flow of electricity, so we are connected to heaven by the divine transmission which flows from the throne of God in heaven into our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="1aJmujdY8zf3BLa1Nx2x7qmPx-CUNhu3l_vTi90iiOmndjKLwrW8aLxpNk6UPXsej"> When I was a young believer, I tried my best to understand, according to the Bible, how I could be in heaven. To my realization, I was on earth and was by no means in heaven, no matter how happy I may have been in the Lord. Now I realize that, because of the transmission from the throne of God in heaven into my spirit, when I enjoy the Lord here on earth, I am simultaneously in heaven. </p>
<p data-content-id="9CMGouSfiMWAlo_AF78CKdna51X81reYi6ay6JvhbqmWxQR8qwvMZ9jTvWt74Euid"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93592" data-verses="Colossians 3:1">3:1</span> Paul says that since we were raised together with Christ, we should seek the things which are above. This verse indicates clearly that we have one position with Christ. How could we seek the things which are above if we <span class="pg" data-page-id="520" id="520">[520]</span> were not above also? To seek the things above we must be in heaven where these things are. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jSqu1fKMETv3AEO0jRP6XSxNDYR2bzZ3Bj8ZR-J9t-t3Qs846TNRWzfLsChMbFjod">IN HEAVEN OR ON EARTH?</h2><p data-content-id="Twq0tWAMk6bVuZEt9Z9lD5HOCT4TRsodL3jAfCQiy5hBnTJuAz_YAL8NdDTj2RtGV"> We need to ask ourselves, then, whether we are in heaven or on earth. In answering this question we need to be careful. The proper way to answer is to say that when we are in spirit we are also in heaven, but when we are not in spirit we are on earth and, experientially, even under the earth. According to our experience, we know that in spirit we may be in heaven one minute and then, because we do not remain in our spirit, we may immediately plunge down to the earth. For example, during your time with the Lord in the morning, you may be in the heavenlies, having prayed yourself into the Spirit. But at the breakfast table your wife or husband may say something to bother you, and immediately you are drawn out of the spirit into the flesh. No longer are you in heaven; you are now on earth. This indicates that only when we are in spirit are we in heaven. Whenever we are outside the spirit, we are earthly. </p>
<p data-content-id="nAAjrYoSxORsKcXED0Y92nk_jMW8eDLYu242cBU-V2b50Voz0s71JJrl7esVgPqMx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93593" data-verses="Colossians 3:1">3:1</span> Paul charges us to seek the things which are above. The way to seek these things is to turn to the spirit and call on the name of the Lord. Our experience tells us clearly that we touch the heavens by turning to our spirit, for our spirit is the receiving end of the divine transmission, whereas the throne of God in heaven is the transmitting end. Thus, by turning to our spirit, we are lifted into heaven. Then in our experience we are in Christ, in the Father, and in heaven. Then in the spirit we are one in position with Christ, seeking the things which are above. </p>

To say that Christ has become our life means that Christ has become us. If Christ does not become us, how can He be our life? Our life cannot be separated from our person. Since Christ is our life, He cannot be separated from us. Because our life is ourself and because Christ is our life, we may say that Christ has become us. However, to say this is neither to deify ourselves nor to teach “evolution into God.” </p>

We are not even able to thoroughly define or describe our physical life. We all have life, but we cannot explain what it is. If even our physical life is mysterious, how much more is this true of Christ as our life! God is the Creator of life, the unique source of life. Although we cannot define life or understand it fully, we certainly can experience it and enjoy it. Just as we cannot deny the fact of our physical life, so we cannot deny the fact that Christ is our life. Hallelujah, I have Christ as my life!

But even the amount of Christ we do have enabled us to have a good enjoyment of the new man. We have a similar experience when brothers from different countries meet together. Even though we speak different languages and need translation in order to communicate, we still have the sense that we are one new man. Even with our <span class="pg" data-page-id="531" id="531">[531]</span> present experience of Christ, we have some realization of the corporate new man. This new man is the issue of our experience of Christ as the reality of all positive things, the embodiment of God, and the mystery of God. If there are some among us with no experience of Christ and no enjoyment of Christ, they will be a hindrance to our fellowship. But all of us have some enjoyment of Christ. Our languages may be different, but our enjoyment is the same. It is this enjoyment that enables us to understand one another and to experience the one new man. The enjoyment of Christ issues in the new man. </p>

When we enjoy Christ as the reality of all positive things, we become Body-conscious. This indicates that the enjoyment of Christ issues in the Body of Christ. Then as we go on to experience Christ as our life and have one living, destiny, and glory with Him, the issue is not just the church as the Body of Christ, but the church as the one new man. To repeat, when we experience Christ as the reality of all our daily necessities, the result is the Body life. But when we experience Christ as our life, the issue is the one new man. </p>

If we go on to enjoy and experience Him as the mysterious life within us and live together with Him, we shall seek the things above, the things in heaven, where Christ is interceding, ministering, and administrating God’s economy. Christ in heaven is very active, even more busy than when He was on earth. He is interceding for us, shepherding all His churches, and ministering on behalf of millions of saints. As the High Priest in heaven, He is interceding for us. Because we have such a high priest, we may “come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we <span class="pg" data-page-id="532" id="532">[532]</span> may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93620" data-verses="Hebrews 4:16">Heb. 4:16</span>). As He intercedes for us, Christ is ministering the heavenly life supply into us. He is the heavenly Minister ministering in the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93621" data-verses="Hebrews 8:1-2">Heb. 8:1-2</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93622" data-verses="Revelation 5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>, as the Lamb on the throne, Christ is executing God’s universal administration. Because Christ is so active for us in the heavens, we should seek the things that are above and set our mind on them. Yes, we need to enjoy Christ as our food, drink, clothing, and everything for our daily existence. But we must go on to seek the things above. </p>
<p data-content-id="riqDpjchUDoSOoMli_WZl-IiyqcFEPNu7gQhs2g1WdrF9hCb4rF0iMESoWGxdqC3t"> To seek the things above and to set our mind on them is to live Christ, to have one living with Him. When Christ prays in heaven, we should pray on earth. This means that there is a transmission between the Christ praying in heaven and us praying on earth. By means of this transmission we may pray in oneness with Him. We respond on earth to Christ’s praying in heaven. None of us should be unemployed. We all have the responsibility to respond to Christ’s heavenly transmission. We need to live together with Christ by seeking the things which are above and setting our mind on them. Christ is in heaven interceding, ministering, and administrating, and we are on earth responding to Christ’s activity in heaven. </p>
<p data-content-id="d9yHx1EHlCF0Nc2ISA4iR70qCZkB08jQsAr0x-_n5uKwoGhkDJWrhSt-NWfOCM6YO"> Young people, do not think that you are too young to cooperate with Christ’s heavenly ministry. Even high school students can seek the things which are above. C. H. Spurgeon began to minister in his village when he was just seventeen, and when he was nineteen he was invited to speak to a Baptist congregation in London. Even as a young man, Spurgeon sought to carry out on earth the work Christ was doing in heaven. If Spurgeon could begin serving the Lord as a young person, the young people in the churches today can do the same. </p>

The first three chapters of Ephesians cover the revelation concerning the church. The second three chapters are concerned with the walk worthy of God’s calling. Likewise, the first two chapters of Colossians present a profound revelation of the all-inclusive and extensive Christ, whereas the last two chapters cover the proper Christian walk. </p>

In the following messages we shall consider the renewing of the new man, the arbitrating peace of Christ, the word of Christ inhabiting us, and persevering in prayer. If we are one with Christ in the things above, we shall have the renewing of the new man. Then, in a practical way, the new man will be realized through the arbitrating peace of Christ. Then we shall have the word of Christ inhabiting us, and we shall persevere in prayer. These five points are crucial aspects of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93644" data-verses="Colossians 3:1">chapters three and four</span> of Colossians. If these points were removed from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93645" data-verses="Colossians 3:1-2">Colossians 3 and 4</span>, these chapters would be lacking in substance. </p>
<p data-content-id="RfNO2lIzA5Rw54npqQTHNA_TMi86evAgvd8yXLZ0NJhLX6FOEZQflozxR78uf33Oy"> These five important matters have much to do with our Christian walk. They are very different from the ethical teachings commonly given to Christians. According to those ethical teachings, believers are charged to improve their behavior, to be good neighbors, to be submissive, and to be loving. There is no doubt that those things are in the Bible. However, they can easily be understood according to the natural concept. Man’s natural mind would never conceive of matters such as being one with Christ in the things above, experiencing the renewing of the new man, or having the peace of Christ arbitrating in us. Of course, in the book of Colossians Paul has something to say about husbands and wives, masters and slaves, parents and children. But his word is related to the new man, the peace of Christ, the word of Christ, and persevering in prayer. </p>

It is extremely difficult to be a proper husband or wife. It is even difficult to be a human being. Since man was created to express God and represent Him, to be a proper human is to be God’s expression and representation. But it is difficult to represent another person or an organization; <span class="pg" data-page-id="541" id="541">[541]</span> how much more difficult it is to represent God. If it is difficult to be a proper human being, it is all the more difficult to be a Christian, especially a Christian who lives Christ. Paul could say, “To me to live is Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93646" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Phil. 1:21</span>). Who among us can say that we are able to live Christ? If we see God’s standard, we shall feel like giving up, for we shall realize that in ourselves we cannot meet God’s requirements. Although it is impossible for us in ourselves to meet God’s standard, with Christ this is possible. When we have the realization that we cannot meet God’s requirements, we can open to receive grace. Grace is the Triune God coming into us to express Himself, to represent Himself, and to live Himself in us and through us. Experiencing the grace of God in this way is altogether different from trying to improve our behavior or attempting in ourselves to meet God’s requirements. </p>
<p data-content-id="LGGjP-PAOdJ8nFxUYQbpLuUqxAMMQvyhMQZw72ekAlg3c478l-zKR4IjWE4Bf53rA"> In the Life-study of Exodus we pointed out that in His salvation God does not want us to do anything or to be anything. Instead, He wants to do everything for us and to be everything to us. This is indicated by the fact that after God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, He changed their diet. When God’s people were in Egypt, they had an Egyptian diet and ate the Egyptian meat, fish, onions, cucumbers, leeks, and garlic. This caused them to become Egyptian in their constitution. They were a composition of the Egyptian food they had eaten. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93647" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">Exodus 16</span> God provided manna for the children of Israel to eat. Their diet was to be changed from Egyptian food to heavenly food. Manna is a type of Christ as our life supply. If we eat Christ as typified by manna, we shall be constituted of Christ. In this way, our constitution will be changed, and our flesh will be dealt with genuinely and thoroughly. </p>
<p data-content-id="mLlsVgAIb-skAhfjqngkuMQKy-RuoCw-Eh0Y8vVQpH3WrdTCEmNX27ibG0XFE_F6p"> We should not think that in ourselves we can be a proper husband or wife. However, the One who has come to live in us is able. This One is Christ, our hope of glory. </p>

First, Christ is in us, but eventually we are with Christ in God. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93649" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">3:4</span>, the Christ who dwells in us is our life. Inwardly we have Christ as our life, and outwardly we have God as our realm and sphere. Sometimes I have the sense when traveling in a car that actually I am traveling in God. He is the realm in which we live and walk. The Christ who dwells in us is life, but the God in whom we are hidden with Christ is the realm of our living. We should be able to testify that we are living not on earth nor even just in heaven, but in God. </p>
<p data-content-id="F8T5SrvVvSK9adYDT1faMIT2oIUYTeOvvK68nXJGmPygBYfXAuqVH6_7nXxzbpNoL"> In ourselves it is not possible for us to be in God. We can only be hidden in God with Christ. Many have been helped to see that through Christ’s incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, God has been wrought into us. But not as many see clearly that we have also been brought into God. Since God is in us and we are in Him, there is two-way traffic between God and us. On the one hand, Colossians tells us that Christ is in us. This indicates that God has been wrought into us. Because Christ is in us, God has been wrought into us. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93650" data-verses="Colossians 3:1">chapter three</span> we are told that we are with Christ in God. This indicates that we have been brought into God. Therefore, God is now in us as our life, and we are in God as the realm of our living. </p>
<p data-content-id="CV0IHBXEspCOWkPgBxpK-FPjqRK4Ks12YOitnjJYe71lPdJfo-RTTzkzgsHXnVKBu"> We should praise the Lord not only that the Triune God is in us, but also that we are in the Triune God. Christ came by incarnation to bring God into us, and He went back to God by crucifixion and resurrection to bring us into God. Concerning this two-way traffic, we should not be restricted by the natural concept. It is crucial for us to see that Christ came both to work God into us and to bring us into God. </p>
<p data-content-id="P48e1Zv0yLRjkEdD3vDxRlw0qxNxABysNs7_pSaWHLCXEoMkdyKlIfpN-GyxhQQiF"> Since we have been brought into God and are hidden with Christ in God, God should be the realm of our living. If we live and walk in God, we shall be heavenly. However, in the book of Colossians, Paul does not speak of heaven, and he does not use the word heavenly. Instead, he mentions the things above. We need to seek the things which are above and set our mind on them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="543" id="543">[543]</span> </p>

The first aspect is that we seek the things above and set our mind on them. Paul’s charge to seek the things above is based on the revelation presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93663" data-verses="Colossians 1:1">chapters one and two</span>. This means that our seeking of the things above must be based on the revelation of the Person and work of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93664" data-verses="Colossians 1:1-2">Colossians 1 and 2</span> Christ is revealed in a marvelous way. Furthermore, the work Christ has accomplished for us is also presented in a full way. In these chapters Christ is revealed as the all-inclusive One. Based on this revelation of Christ’s Person and work, we may seek the things which are above. As we have pointed out, these things refer to Christ’s heavenly ministry, to His ministry as the High Priest, Minister, and Administrator of God’s economy. </p>

He is interceding, ministering, and executing God’s administration. We on earth should respond to Christ’s activities in heaven. Although Christ in His earthly ministry fully accomplished redemption for our salvation, He has not yet completed the building up of His Body. For the building up of the Body, His ministry in heaven is necessary. It is not the desire of Christ simply to have a large group of saved people; He wants the saved ones to be built up together as His Body. Christ desires a Body, a building, a bride. In order to have the Body built up, Christ must carry on the work of His heavenly ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="7cuojx9EnikxgkGvSa0_PvMZIlh3VfE5yo0N_UaqITA8UbezEJgBcuGWFgD9_1aau"> Between Christ in heaven and us on earth there is a <span class="pg" data-page-id="550" id="550">[550]</span> divine transmission, a heavenly current. If we are receiving this transmission, we shall respond to Christ’s work in heaven. However, if in our experience we are not continuously connected to Him or if we allow insulation to build up between us and Him, the transmission will cease. It is most pitiful that among many genuine Christians today the connection with the heavenly Christ in their experience has been severed. They are genuine Christians, but they do not experience the divine current, and there is no fellowship between them and the Lord. We hope that the situation among us will be absolutely different from this. Instead of being cut off from the heavenly Christ, in our experience we need to continually receive the divine transmission. Day and night, we should be infused with a supply from heaven, and experience the transaction between the heavenly Christ and us. We should continually respond to Christ’s interceding, ministering, and executing of God’s administration. </p>
<p data-content-id="_0z4CjgcRAzGySPl6nQ9kckrV88iAnVLuxfmejJOVBUIS_-qK7UtCn7ND1Qwyrk2f"> To seek the things above means that we correspond to Christ’s heavenly ministry.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93667" data-verses="Colossians 3:10">3:10</span> Paul says, “And having put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him Who created him.” On the one hand, Paul speaks of the creation of the new man; on the other hand, he refers to the renewing of the new man. Since the new man has already been created, why is there still the need for the new man to be renewed? How can the new man be both created and renewed? We have seen that the creation of the new man took place in our spirit. When our spirit was regenerated, the new man was created. Hence, the regeneration of the spirit is actually the creation of the new man. However, as far as the soul is concerned, the new man still needs to be renewed. It is crucial that this renewing take place especially in our <span class="pg" data-page-id="551" id="551">[551]</span> mind, the leading part of the soul. Before we were regenerated, our human spirit was part of the old creation. Then at the time of our regeneration, God the Spirit came into our spirit with the divine life and divine nature. This means that the Spirit of God regenerated our spirit with the elements of the divine life and divine nature. In other words, when we were regenerated, God the Spirit brought the divine life and nature into our spirit. Before regeneration we did not have anything divine. But at the time of regeneration, something divine—the life and nature of God—was added into our spirit. By receiving the life and nature of God, we were born of God and became sons of God. Now we are not merely sons of man, but we are also sons of God. Moreover, we are not God’s sons-in-law; we are His sons in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="lGebDchapj8MhaQa-6qJi3EWhy_6DCoIEBHfdfUryVbKKL4PAwixxjPTbBKYDu4Le"> Because the divine life and nature have been added to our spirit, our regenerated spirit has become part of the new creation. The difference between the old creation and the new creation is that the old creation has nothing of God in it, but the new creation does have something of God added to it. The reason the regenerated spirit is part of the new creation and of the new man is that the life and nature of God has come into it. In our spirit we have something divine—God’s life and nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="OLv1qDRjKPpb7WeQhnpjddP7gTrMWtpE-1ppPPLq1fp8MR8MpzzfwWWMlwmSEija5"> At the time of regeneration the life and nature of God were added into our spirit, making it the new creation; nevertheless, the soul with its faculties of mind, emotion, and will remains in the old creation. Thus, there is the need for the divine life and nature to spread from our spirit into our soul and to saturate the soul. This process of spreading and saturating is what we call transformation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93668" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Romans 12:2</span> Paul charges us to “be transformed by the renewing of the mind.” Since the mind is the leading part of the soul, the renewing of the soul depends on the renewing of the mind. As the divine life and nature spread from our regenerated spirit into the mind, emotion, and will, our soul will be renewed. This renewing of the soul is actually the renewing of the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="4IBzwnFeZUmiPTldQylpqjfn56UuxIheAumWT0F5vBeYLZvZUxnAH8UtbPcg2OgXO"> Even though we have been regenerated, we are often <span class="pg" data-page-id="552" id="552">[552]</span> inclined to live according to the old man, that is, to live according to the old creation. However, deep in our spirit we have the aspiration, the desire, to live in newness of life. This desire comes from the new man in our spirit seeking to spread the divine life and nature into our soul. This spreading is the renewing of the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="omf13Bx02SFTK6-4sHpHdKgUza2ji_SgyrvnjZRmemRqzlC_dbZvNK2s_tofFhghm"> Not many Christians have seen that the renewing of the new man depends on our seeking the things which are above. If we do not seek the things above and set our mind on them, it will be difficult for us to be renewed in soul. But whenever we set our mind on the things above, our inner being is renewed spontaneously. Our experience testifies of this. </p>
<p data-content-id="3UjYSiEHFuVk3dorn6OJHP8Sz_9jF_TE1JDXU4fE-zxmVMphWG74zhUcdZ0bQV1Uw"> Paul admonished the Colossian believers to seek the things which are above because they had been distracted to earthly things, to the elements of the world such as Judaism, Gnosticism, mysticism, and asceticism. As long as they were distracted by these things, they could have nothing to do with the things above. This was the reason Paul charged them to forget Judaism, Greek philosophy, Gnosticism, mysticism, and any kind of culture and to seek the things above and set their mind on them. The things above do not include any religion, philosophy, or culture. Instead, they include Christ’s priesthood, ministry, and administration with all His activities. It is crucial for us to realize that Christ is our Head and that we are the members of His Body. Christ and we together form a universal man. As the One in heaven, He is the Head, and as those on earth, we are the Body. As the Head is working in heaven by interceding, ministering, and administrating, we, the Body, are working on earth responding to the heavenly ministry of Christ and reflecting what He is doing in heaven. What a tremendous matter this is! Instead of caring for earthly religion, worldly philosophy, and the other elements of the world, we should seek the things above and set our mind on them. If we turn to the heavenly Christ with all His activities and set our mind on these things, the renewing of the new man will take place automatically. <span class="pg" data-page-id="553" id="553">[553]</span> </p>

If we would have a proper Christian life, we first need to set our mind on the things above. As we have pointed out, these things are related to what Christ is doing in heaven. As the High Priest, Christ is interceding for us. As the heavenly Minister, He is dispensing the riches of life into us. As the divine Administrator, He is executing God’s economy. Christ’s ministry in heaven is for the building up of His Body. He desires to build up the church so that He may have His bride. In our Christian walk we need to set our mind on the things above. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lGebDchapj8MhaQa-6qJi3EWhyv6EQoIEBHfdfUryVbKKL4PAwixxjPTbBKYDu4Le">“SWITCHING ON” TO THE DIVINE TRANSMISSION<br/>FOR THE RENEWING OF THE NEW MAN</h2><p data-content-id="OLv1qDRjKPpb7WeQhnpjddP7gT7MQ_5E-1ppPPLq1fp8MR8MpzzfwWWMlwmSEija5"> Following the setting of the mind on the things above is the renewing of the new man. Apparently there is no connection between setting our mind on the things above and the renewing of the new man. Actually, according to our experience, these two matters are closely related. The renewing of the new man is fully dependent on our setting the mind on the things above. The reason for this is that a spiritual transmission is involved. When we set our mind on the things above, we open our being to what is taking place in heaven. We also respond to Christ’s ministry in heaven and reflect it. Simultaneously, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit flows into us. This transmission may be illustrated by electricity. On the one hand, electricity is in the power plant; on <span class="pg" data-page-id="560" id="560">[560]</span> the other hand, it is in our homes. Between these two ends, the power plant and our homes, a transmission is taking place. This transmission is called the flow of the current of electricity. The current of electricity is actually electricity itself in motion. In the same principle, between Christ in heaven and us on earth, there is a divine transmission, the flowing of the life-giving Spirit. By means of this transmission, heaven and earth are brought together. Those with experience realize that this is not a dream or a religious superstition. It is a divine, heavenly, and spiritual reality. The heavenly electricity is flowing, and it joins heaven and earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="4IBzwnFeZUmiPTldQylpqjfn56Eu4bBeAumWT0F5vBeYLZvZUxnAH8UtbPcg2OgXO"> The all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is the issue of Christ’s redemption. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93678" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">Galatians 3:14</span> indicates that Christ has redeemed us so that we may receive the Spirit. Christ accomplished redemption not merely to save us from sin, but even the more to impart Himself into us as the life-giving Spirit. Praise the Lord that in the universe there is a wonderful, heavenly, divine “electricity”—the life-giving Spirit! When we open our being and set our mind on the things above, this Spirit transmits the riches of the divine life into us. All we need to do is “switch on” and the heavenly current flows. The way to “switch on” is to set our mind on the things above. This causes the heavenly transmission to function in our experience to bring the divine essence of Christ into us. The more this essence is added into our being, the more we experience the renewing of the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="omf13Bx02SFTK6-4sHpHdKgUzamjqsigyrvnjZRmemRqzlC_dbZvNK2s_tofFhghm"> Renewing is different from teaching. We may be taught about God without having anything of the divine substance added into our being. Renewing depends on the transmission of the divine substance into us. The more the divine element is added to us, the more we are renewed. Most of today’s Christians do not experience this renewing. What they have is merely teaching. By the Lord’s mercy, our aim in His recovery is not to pass on mere teachings, but to help the saints to experience the divine transmission. In the ministry we wish to share the revelation from the Word of God. Then as the saints have the hearing of faith and open to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="561" id="561">[561]</span> Lord, “switching on” by setting their mind on the things above, they will be supplied by the heavenly transmission. At times we may be sad or depressed. But if we open to the heavenly transmission, we shall be filled with joy. We may even want to shout and praise the Lord. The reason for this change is that the heavenly transmission brings the divine element into our being. This is what produces the renewing, which affects our mind, emotion, and will. It is crucial for us to see the connection between the renewing of the new man and setting our mind on the things above. </p>

Do you know what the peace of Christ is? This term is used just once in the New Testament. Elsewhere, in Romans and in Philippians, Paul speaks of the God of peace. Moreover, at the beginning of his Epistles he invariably has a word about grace and peace. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93681" data-verses="Colossians 3:15">Colossians 3:15</span> he tells us that the peace of Christ should arbitrate in our hearts. We should not assume that we understand what it means for the peace of Christ to arbitrate in our hearts. Instead of taking this word for granted, we should exercise to get the proper understanding. </p>
<p data-content-id="P48e1Zv0yLRjkEdD3vDxRlw0qxtxDBSsNs7_pSaWHLCXEoMkdyKlIfpN-GyxhQQiF"> According to the context of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93682" data-verses="Colossians 3:1">Colossians 3</span>, when we set our mind on the things above, the divine element is transmitted into us for the renewing of the new man. As the new man is being renewed, we should allow the peace of Christ to arbitrate in our hearts. The renewing of the new man is actually the spreading of the new man within us. As the new man spreads, we need to let the peace of Christ arbitrate within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="-8P5_We9HlrZyO3mbt2-Dnw25Hhjn3ZMPtZfEzTH8mFI2NJZdM2qdWpYHt1XsAb0_"> It is very easy in the church life to offend one another or to make one another unhappy. In the matter of arranging chairs in the meeting hall, a brother may be unhappy if the arrangement is not according to his opinion. But if we open to the Lord when we are offended and tell Him that we love <span class="pg" data-page-id="562" id="562">[562]</span> Him, something heavenly will be transmitted into us. Then spontaneously we shall be happy with the one who offended us. This is an example of the peace of Christ arbitrating in our heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="piRKMgn5tqXQZ3-2TvISTCkGOvw07Q5jTePG4ht9Tcd7P32I3OUf8n-_v44p36SzH"> This arbitrating peace preserves the oneness in the church life. The divisions caused by different opinions are a serious damage to the church life and cut the new man into pieces. But the arbitrating peace of Christ brought in by the heavenly transmission keeps us in oneness and preserves the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="vIx9uQjmeEwOiVEgDgH8y0xEdfA03MyCYgINrThFa0OoCG1Z0wmuhOJ40BCNUJHpK"> I can testify that often, when I have been unhappy with someone in the church life, I have contacted the Lord and called on His name. Many times I say, “Lord Jesus, I thank You for Your presence, for Your anointing, and for everything You have been to me.” When I give thanks to the Lord in this way, the divine transmission begins to work. After a few minutes, I may be so full that I am beside myself with joy. Then spontaneously I begin to count the one who made me unhappy better than myself. When I see him the next time, I have no problem with him. Because I experience the Lord’s transmission and arbitration, I do not have problems with any of the saints in the Lord’s recovery. </p>
<p data-content-id="W0UKyOT0t1IBxSIccUYMsUMOjR7Z3c_JmT-k52DOjH1qiyrn6ODlKeTuGk-ooeEF4"> When a local church is first established, the saints may experience a church-life honeymoon. But just as there is no permanent honeymoon in married life, there is no permanent honeymoon in the church life. Friction develops eventually between the saints. This friction causes the wrinkles Paul speaks of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93683" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span>. If we do not have the peace of Christ arbitrating in us, wrinkles will continue to develop. But if the heavenly transmission supplies us with the divine element, the wrinkles will be removed metabolically. Then instead of friction there will be the arbitrating peace of Christ. </p>

Why does Paul mention the peace of Christ before the word of Christ? The answer to this question is related to the basic principle revealed in the Bible that God’s speaking requires oneness. Whenever God’s people are divided, His word becomes rare. God does not speak where there is division. Division causes God’s speaking to diminish, even to cease altogether. </p>
<p data-content-id="ggDaF55GyBbxJPqPBphLCbZadPBKbmgCTqIDR3goq-SVfvSN8prg0TR811vkyUmRZ"> When the children of Israel were in the wilderness, God spoke in the tent of meeting. The tent of meeting was a sign of the oneness of God’s people. The twelve tribes were arranged around the tent of meeting, and God spoke to the people from within the tent of meeting. Any Israelite at that time who wanted God’s speaking had to come to the tent of meeting, the place of oneness. </p>
<p data-content-id="ebF32ctwP_e7REaxpIcbMtYbZo4fCvMLDYsGl3bv4T3pP5hTy7t2LO_iBZ3Z1dSVZ"> The temple built in Jerusalem was the continuation of the tent of meeting. When God’s people were divided into the northern and southern kingdoms, God’s speaking was found only in the south, because that was where the temple was located. Because there was no temple in the north, God’s speaking through the priesthood was not found there. God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="568" id="568">[568]</span> speaking through the priests came out of the Holy of Holies, the center both of the tabernacle and of the temple. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5znjdl0RibbATJcKH_ecb09_kcBFnWQnNfuxNd8ItWQaf-xO-QYNQQKXpfnLolJRo">GOD SPEAKING<br/>IN THE SON AND THROUGH THE BODY</h2><p data-content-id="c33eAwsfVfXraWL3f3puOBKwofKxS_tqYFcEXib3Lo6hB_NVq0ahbWwl2qspOIzbJ"> The book of Hebrews opens with these words: “In many portions and in many ways, God, having spoken of old to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93691" data-verses="Hebrews 1:1-2">Heb. 1:1-2a</span>). As the Son of God, the Lord Jesus not only spoke the word of God, but He Himself was even called the Word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93692" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93693" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93694" data-verses="Revelation 19:13">Rev. 19:13</span>). God spoke in His Son and not merely through Him. Wherever the Son was, there the Word was also. Furthermore, when the Son spoke, God spoke in the Son’s speaking. The Son came to express God, to define God, and to speak forth God. In His very being and Person, the Son was the Word of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="YHo9_4F4rbtTN6uJrNVKlcVHaapwaskIM1JeaWPCErK8lD8OYCz-gEq8DCxiWamqp"> The evil intention of the Jewish religionists was to terminate the Son of God, Jesus of Nazareth, by crucifying Him. But after His crucifixion, the Lord entered into the realm of resurrection, and in resurrection He became the Head of the Body. Before His crucifixion and resurrection, the Lord Jesus was restricted by the flesh. It was not possible for Him to be universal. But through death and resurrection He was enlarged from an individual to a corporate man. On the day of Pentecost Christ came down as the all-inclusive Spirit upon His disciples to make them members of His Body. This Body, a corporate man, includes the resurrected Christ as the Head and the millions of believers in Christ as the members. Now, just as my whole body speaks whenever I speak, so the Body of Christ speaks whenever Christ speaks as the Head. Today the Son of God is no longer merely an individual; He is a corporate, universal man. For this reason, all the members of the Body can speak the word of God. Even young people can go to their parents or classmates and speak to them on God’s behalf. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ekj8KtyS_lkUZoS96keszutDk3I6C2QcNJn28_oNc3vFOaI1hUNqhE5B4RkV_HSQJ"> We all were saved through the hearing of God’s word. When I was saved in China more than fifty years ago, God Himself did not come to speak to me directly. Rather, I heard <span class="pg" data-page-id="569" id="569">[569]</span> God’s word through a member of His Body. This is one example of the fact that God today continues to speak in His Son who has been enlarged to become a corporate man, the Body of Christ. How wonderful that we all are part of the enlargement of Christ, part of a universal man of which Christ is the Head and we are the members! </p>
<p data-content-id="DoDlSswZom_4i2OTnuzO3QHEC5MZ3SZ-vevsKnj9CyhxI_r5snfUvFBDoS7HJ6EHS"> If we are truly one with other members of the Body of Christ, we shall be able to speak God’s word. However, if we are not one with the saints but are filled with murmuring, complaining, and gossiping about others, we shall not be able to speak the word of the Lord. Speaking God’s word requires oneness. Where there is no oneness, there can be no speaking. If we allow the peace of Christ to arbitrate in us to maintain oneness and harmony, we shall be able to speak the word of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sr4B7OdLi_gaxbmxLXiEYa2SW2qIHqPLZGWdu23POQDxs7Xqf3z_YUMIa59gSQKwD"> Christ died on the cross to make peace by accomplishing redemption and reconciling us to God. This peace is vertical, the peace between us and God. Christ died also to create horizontal peace, the peace between us and others. For this, Christ abolished all the ordinances, the different ways of worship and living. By abolishing the ordinances, Christ has made peace horizontally among the different peoples. In doing this, He nullified the effect of Babel. At Babel mankind was confused, confounded, divided, and scattered. There the corporate man created by God was divided. But by His death on the cross Christ cancelled the confusion and division of Babel. He has made peace both vertically and horizontally. Thus, on the day of Pentecost, Christ could come down upon the believers as the uniting Spirit and bring forth the church in a practical way. At Pentecost those who spoke many different languages became one. </p>
<p data-content-id="ggDaF55GyBbxJPqPBphLCbZadPBKd1QCTqIDR3goq-SVfvSN8prg0TR811vkyUmRZ"> Although Christ nullified division to produce oneness, today’s Christianity has destroyed the oneness and produced division. For this reason, in divided Christianity there is no speaking from God. Instead of hearing God’s speaking, many who sit in the chapels, cathedrals, and denominational buildings hear someone talk about social life or politics. This certainly is not the speaking of God in the Son through the <span class="pg" data-page-id="570" id="570">[570]</span> Body. The reason for this lack of speaking is the lack of peace and oneness. Because there is no oneness, there is no center, no oracle, for God’s speaking. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ebF32ctwP_e7REaxpIcbMtYbZo4fL8MLDYsGl3bv4T3pP5hTy7t2LO_iBZ3Z1dSVZ">NO SHORTAGE OF GOD’S WORD</h2><p data-content-id="5znjdl0RibbATJcKH_ecb09_kcBFvFAnNfuxNd8ItWQaf-xO-QYNQQKXpfnLolJRo"> We thank the Lord that the situation in His recovery is altogether different from this. We have an abundance of the Lord’s speaking. Consider how much of the word of God has been released among us in the recovery during the past years. The reason there is so much of God’s speaking in the recovery is that here we have genuine oneness. We experience this oneness and the harmony in the Spirit not only when the churches come together for a conference, but also in the meetings of the various local churches. In the meetings we have the Lord’s speaking, and we are edified, nourished, and enlightened. When the peace of Christ arbitrates in us and keeps us in a situation full of oneness and harmony, we become the place of God’s speaking, His oracle. Deep in my spirit I realize that the meetings are an oracle, a place where God can come in to speak. </p>
<p data-content-id="NvL9nhfr9y1MfkuCnJjWc5-mFnwZRLH-02hvDSNt9dQdENu8DeMorULDAd59B1LCF"> Now we see the connection between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93695" data-verses="Colossians 3:15-16">3:15 and 16</span>. The peace of Christ arbitrates in us to keep us in a proper condition to receive God’s word. The arbitrating peace of Christ is for God’s oracle, the place of His speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="t5iqp8-G4gD5mGLTCIR_DHqa8Tcd6vluKEbpWrQpW1yZ_muRMBVOIaTGcMROMFrnI"> For a proper Christian walk we need to set our mind on things above. When we do this, we “switch on” to the heavenly transmission, the divine current of “electricity” which flows from the throne in heaven to us on earth. This transmission causes the renewing of the new man, for it brings a new element, the divine substance, into our being. Following the renewing, we have the arbitrating peace of Christ. The very element of Christ transmitted into us becomes the essence of the peace which rules in us. This arbitrating peace not only solves our problems, but also dissolves them. It enables us to be kept in oneness and to be preserved in a harmonious condition. It also opens the way for the word of God to come with the bountiful supply. Because we have the arbitrating peace, in the Lord’s recovery there is no shortage of God’s word. <span class="pg" data-page-id="571" id="571">[571]</span> </p>

In married life a husband and wife may persevere in the exchange of words. Once an argument begins, neither the husband nor the wife may be willing to give in. During my many years in the church life, I have observed many cases where the saints persevered in the expression of their ideas, concepts, or opinions. No matter what the situation, they were not willing to change their opinion. These negative examples show that we do know what it means to persevere. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9CMGouSfiMWAlo_AF78CKdna62X884-Yi6ay6JvhbqmWxQR8qwvMZ9jTvWt74Euid">PRAYER AND WARFARE</h2><p data-content-id="jSqu1fKMETv3AEO0jRP6XSxNAbR2Tgp3Bj8ZR-J9t-t3Qs846TNRWzfLsChMbFjod"> According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93705" data-verses="Colossians 4:2">4:2</span>, the thing that requires our perseverance is prayer. We need to persevere in prayer <span class="pg" data-page-id="578" id="578">[578]</span> because prayer involves a battle, a fight. Two parties, God and Satan, are hostile to each other. The meaning of the name Satan is adversary. Satan is both the enemy without and the adversary within. On the one hand, he is the enemy trying to defeat God; on the other hand, he is the adversary within God’s realm seeking to cause damage. As the adversary, Satan opposes God from within God’s realm, God’s kingdom. This is the reason the Bible clearly indicates that even today Satan has access to the place of God’s throne. In the book of Job we see that Satan can stand before the throne of God and accuse people before Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93706" data-verses="Job 1:6-12">Job 1:6-12</span>). It is difficult for us to understand why God allows His enemy such freedom. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93707" data-verses="Revelation 12:10">Revelation 12:10</span>, Satan accuses us day and night. </p>
<p data-content-id="uei5QW3MGv90tAA2FxD3LJZfcM3-F4R75QFjeBrVrSzVrCFjdoepppbzqxBliOuF8"> Although the battle raging in the universe is between God and Satan, another party is involved. This third party consists of God’s chosen and redeemed people, the ones who will actually decide the outcome of the battle. If we take sides with Satan, God will lose, even though He is almighty. As the infinite, all-powerful Creator, God will not lower Himself to fight against one of His creatures. Thus, it is necessary for another of God’s creatures—man—to fight against Satan. In a very real sense, God needs us. Without us, He would not have a way to carry on the battle against Satan. He must maintain His status as the Creator. For this reason, He needs us to carry on the actual work of warfare. </p>
<p data-content-id="f5FHReDvsyzvBMFzyvsIslz0UP1lMYqgmUB6rb4-E6X-5JRriI2ZE461KcHMoNa9f"> In order to fight on God’s side against Satan, we need to persevere in prayer. This perseverance is needed because the course of the whole world is away from God. To pray is to go against the current, the trend, in the fallen universe. Persevering in prayer is like rowing a boat upstream. If you do not persevere, you will be carried downstream by the current. No doubt, to persevere in this way, either in rowing or in praying, requires a great deal of energy. The entire universe is under Satan’s influence and is contrary to God’s will. Hence, there is a strong current in the world in opposition to the will of God. As those who take sides with God, we <span class="pg" data-page-id="579" id="579">[579]</span> find that the whole universe is against us and, in particular, against our prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ij7bPPSnYgJ7k5YLk7p3WF7OCu049jispqhi6sQh09yxxcsmTBisNQ0qrwyEIQciJ"> Many of the experiences we have with respect to prayer day by day prove that Satan opposes our prayer in every way possible. For example, a telephone call may come just when you are at a very important point in your prayer. You have prayed yourself into the Spirit, and you are touching the heavens. Then, at that very moment, the telephone may ring. You may answer the telephone only to learn that someone has dialed the wrong number. Your praying spirit may be seriously damaged by the irritation this causes you. When we try to pray, we may also be disturbed by our children, by callers at the door, or by any animal pets there may be in the house. Because there is so much resistance to our prayer, we definitely need to persevere in prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="HJXSCv7FjRX11Nlg8l5j7efQg6HgONZ6T3GdC5v5dCb9ChbHCNsZDKBUk5DL1WVtx"> Some sisters claim that they have very little time to pray. In their attempt to make excuses for themselves, they may point to all the responsibilities they must fulfill day by day. However, these same sisters may have plenty of time to gossip on the telephone. They find it extremely easy to talk on the telephone, but very difficult to pray. To them, praying is like climbing a mountain. It is tiring and takes tremendous energy. But they do not find it exhausting to gossip. This illustration indicates that resistance to prayer lies not only outside us, but even within us. This is the reason we all find it difficult to pray. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XqFwK4-uCOxRvgyEbG31TFRJZBXgOw1v26KaLLx9rvafbSffqSmEd1W12EaU8vYF3">A VOW CONCERNING OUR PRAYER LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="kX1nUfZuqQkzrLrgt3NFkih8hBhwQ2eJ9RDPm9pQmA9VJDK3iAAZbqak9qWDfH_Sw"> In light of the fact that there is great resistance to praying, let us now consider in a very practical way how to persevere in prayer. Before you try to persevere in prayer, you should first make a deal with the Lord concerning your prayer life. Pray to Him in a definite way and say, “Lord, I mean business with You about this matter of prayer. I call heaven and earth to witness that from this time forth I will have a life of prayer. I will not be a prayerless person. Rather, I will be a praying person.” If you do not have such a prayer to the Lord, you will not be able to persevere in <span class="pg" data-page-id="580" id="580">[580]</span> prayer. We need to say to Him, “Lord, I am desperate about this. I offer myself to You so that I may have a prayer life. Lord, keep me in the spirit of prayer. If I forget this or neglect this, I know that You will not forget it. Remind me again and again about prayer.” This kind of prayer may be regarded as a vow made to the Lord. We all need to make a vow to Him concerning our prayer life. We should tell the Lord, “Lord, I know that if I forget this vow, You will not forget it. From the very beginning, Lord, I want to clearly hand the responsibility over to You. Lord, don’t let me go. Remind me to pray.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="J_nFMNQorB6p2GT8JBzVIJEJng9RIYNHJ9mfOn7jgTGQpHDcX8vywWDQZdhqUypmp">SETTING ASIDE DEFINITE TIMES</h2><p data-content-id="zxxKVZo0L_3UdrO9iX46Tdlvzm1Hq-fB11uoqtjPBjhY_rEsDeSQDqGrA0qATN0ay"> After we make such a deal with the Lord concerning prayer, we should set aside definite times for prayer. For instance, you may reserve ten minutes every morning. During this time, prayer must be the top priority. Our attitude should be that prayer is our most important business and that nothing should be allowed to interfere with it. If we do not have this attitude, we shall not be able to have a successful prayer life. No matter how many things we have to do each day, we can reserve at least a few minutes here and there for prayer. We may pray a little in the morning. Then again at noon, after work, and in the evening we may have other times for prayer. By setting aside definite times during the day, we may be able to have a half hour reserved for prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="aw_owglmYsbhVQpnqDeZZJvwUgVpyKPcebdjcPDhLYFI9FSkEF8RpLBEHkqv-h5U3"> When you are observing a set time for prayer at home, take the telephone off the hook. This will help eliminate distractions. Prayer time is not the time for telephone calls. Furthermore, you should not pay attention to those knocking at your door. The time you have dedicated to the Lord for prayer should be used only for prayer, not for anything else. Regarding this, you need to be strong and persevering. </p>
<p data-content-id="bII_pa96wW65xpS_TOga8Qb0q12g1fUpsR-fiE2GZ2XncQE7FKuNnsp2sqi-cXeIt"> In order to have more time for prayer, we should try to save time during the day. For example, perhaps we can reduce the time spent in personal grooming or in conversation with others. Unnecessary talk weakens our praying <span class="pg" data-page-id="581" id="581">[581]</span> spirit, damages the praying atmosphere, and occupies time that can be used for prayer. The battle over prayer is continual. Probably it will last until eternity. </p>
