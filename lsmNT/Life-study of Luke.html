It may seem that the Gospel of Luke is not as profound as the Gospel of Matthew or as mysterious as the Gospel of John. The reason for this is that Luke gives us a record of our Savior, the Lord Jesus, as a Man. A man, of course, is not profound when compared to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="EnWCv_eiedBm6acXaSgAyz436_MxGVx9OO_VMk3ydCyoMCmwj4AjjstBnWwxvP728"> Although the Gospel of Luke is not the most profound or mysterious of the four Gospels, it is the most sweet and pleasant of the Gospels. Yes, God is profound. But when He became a man, He became sweet and pleasant. </p>
<p data-content-id="DoAIPBJjBHkq_0FWb5TCpPOpXz6H4o4mOlsgbBKk_d-ko1FGk9fqp5bptFLQcr1Cs"> In Matthew we see the King; in Mark, the Slave; and in John, God Himself. In Luke we see the Man. Luke’s narration concerning the Lord Jesus as the Man-Savior is very sweet and pleasant. Both the narrative and the narration itself are sweet and pleasant. </p>

The “matters” in this verse are the events of John the Baptist’s birth, ministry, <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> and martyrdom, and of Jesus’ birth, life, ministry, teaching, death, resurrection, and ascension for the accomplishment of God’s redemption to save sinners by grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="8rK9hZU17CqFQv_7a-sMeUDV076l38frJWrb3fYskUnsCbvB8WxSNVgXi8Bko75qT"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67985" data-verses="Luke 1:2">Verse 2</span> indicates that the writer of this Gospel was not among those disciples who were with the Savior in His earthly life. By “those who from the beginning became eyewitnesses and attendants of the Word,” Luke denotes the first group of New Testament believers, who were with the Savior in His ministry on earth. They are called attendants of the Word. The Greek word rendered “attendants” means official servants, who attend or serve an officer or who have authority to carry out his orders. This word is used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67986" data-verses="Luke 4:20">Luke 4:20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67987" data-verses="Matthew 5:25">Matthew 5:25</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67988" data-verses="Mark 14:54">Mark 14:54</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67989" data-verses="Acts 26:16">Acts 26:16</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67990" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:1">1 Corinthians 4:1</span>. The Word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67991" data-verses="Luke 1:2">1:2</span> is the Word of the gospel ministered and preached to people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67992" data-verses="Acts 6:4">Acts 6:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67993" data-verses="Acts 8:4">8:4</span>). </p>

This consecutive account concerns the life, ministry, and martyrdom of John the Baptist and the life, ministry, teaching, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus the Man-Savior. This Gospel may be regarded as a biography of these two persons. Of course, the Gospel of Luke is mainly a biography of the Savior. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="_ZwqsA5v5sK5Gd_CAsUVx_U-oyUvJZvrd4_dLBztnh2YyrGo-ZQKJ0rrkSkFZAXKk">Written by Luke</h2><p data-content-id="B-xax8NKp7LCijI7XuQMm9Jos3kSlmvYlicWUqjousBPGePPVlOH7nulgHhpJQvmR"> The early church recognized Luke as the author of both this Gospel and Acts. Luke’s authorship is evident from the style of composition of the two books. Luke was a Gentile (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67995" data-verses="Colossians 4:14">Col. 4:14</span>, cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67996" data-verses="Colossians 4:11">11</span>), probably an Asiatic Greek, and a physician (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67997" data-verses="Colossians 4:14">Col. 4:14</span>). Starting in Troas, he joined Paul in his ministry and accompanied him in his last three ministry journeys (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67998" data-verses="Acts 16:10-17">Acts 16:10-17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67999" data-verses="Acts 20:5">20:5—21:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68000" data-verses="Acts 27:1">27:1—28:15</span>). He was a faithful companion of Paul until Paul was martyred <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68001" data-verses="Philemon 1:24">Philem. 24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68002" data-verses="2Timothy 4:11">2 Tim. 4:11</span>). Hence, his Gospel should represent Paul’s views, as Mark’s represents Peter’s. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="xdxTxFZ3QLG06tmoUaQONLKoarNeZMRzYj39H4NLabyTJr4rWTMePzQvvgQ8LEOaY">To Theophilus</h2><p data-content-id="rR_dpE6vYaDaPaCKi11uoiNGNcFtz_3rupQBp4xmcb2zrtZinaTEqSTzFHUuwqBbj"> We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68003" data-verses="Luke 1:3-4">Luke 1:3-4</span> that this Gospel was written to Theophilus. This is a Greek name meaning loved by God, or friend of God. Theophilus was probably a Gentile believer who occupied some official position under the Roman Empire. Hence, this Gospel was written by a Gentile physician to a Gentile officer. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dvWnnIN7e0JKw-7c5LXxsoFKvbCR3lHyth-Z-qR8i3gE62O3MzE72ycw46N8mvBgO">SUBJECT—THE MAN-SAVIOR AND HIS SALVATION<br/>IN THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF MORALITY</h2><p data-content-id="QS_uuvFcVjx6uGVtPvuBZAQnlYKY1jnXQkbZwmBnmy1XcRsI7z2kVs1C7kIjs7vSf"> Because Luke’s Gospel is one of the synoptic Gospels concerning the Savior’s humanity, its purpose is to present the Savior as a genuine, normal, and perfect Man, revealing God among men in His saving grace to fallen mankind. It narrates a complete genealogy of the Man Jesus, from His parents back to Adam, the first generation of mankind. This shows that He is a genuine descendant of man—a son of man. Its record of this Man’s life impresses us with the completeness and perfection of His humanity. Hence, its emphasis is the Man-Savior. It presents, based upon the moral principles which apply to all men, gospel messages as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68004" data-verses="Luke 4:16-21">4:16-21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68005" data-verses="Luke 7:41-43">7:41-43</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68006" data-verses="Luke 12:14-21">12:14-21</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68007" data-verses="Luke 13:2-5">13:2-5</span>; gospel parables as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68008" data-verses="Luke 10:30-37">10:30-37</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68009" data-verses="Luke 14:16-24">14:16-24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68010" data-verses="Luke 15:3-32">15:3-32</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68011" data-verses="Luke 18:9-14">18:9-14</span>; and gospel cases as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68012" data-verses="Luke 7:36-50">7:36-50</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68013" data-verses="Luke 13:10-17">13:10-17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68014" data-verses="Luke 16:19-31">16:19-31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68015" data-verses="Luke 19:1-10">19:1-10</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68016" data-verses="Luke 23:39-43">23:39-43</span>; these are not recorded in the other Gospels. Luke does not stress the dispensational aspect or the Jewish background as Matthew does. The Gospel of Luke is the Gospel written to mankind in general, announcing the good news to all people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68017" data-verses="Luke 2:10">2:10</span>). Its characteristic is absolutely not Jewish, but Gentile (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68018" data-verses="Luke 4:25-28">4:25-28</span>). It is a Gospel to all sinners, both Jews and Gentiles. As such, its record is according to the sequence of morality, not according to the sequence of historical events. </p>
<p data-content-id="K6HmpZJGTPRsiY1ah0OYCD534UlqtsBFDVHQgSo9S8is_l13ggA-7Yse3XgT2zYV3"> The subject of the Gospel of Luke is marvelous: the Man-Savior and His salvation in the highest standard of morality. Here we have the Man-Savior, His salvation, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> the highest standard of morality. I believe that most readers of this Gospel would realize that this book speaks of a Man who is our Savior. Hence, we may call Him the Man-Savior. Also, it is rather easy to realize that this book shows us the Man-Savior’s salvation. However, not many readers of this Gospel realize that the Man-Savior and His salvation are both in the highest standard of morality. </p>
<p data-content-id="lXx03sAZnH1566ErI8gk8LmN6YjVqHNC8OyUynANn47kviFgaPXvRFBN-BRclOuC0"> When some hear that Luke presents the Man-Savior and His salvation in the highest standard of morality, they may say, “We can’t find the word ‘morality’ in this book. We do not even see the thought of morality.” Apparently, this may be the case. But if we search into the depths of this book, we shall see that it does convey the highest standard of morality. According to the Gospel of Luke, our Savior lives, behaves, and works in the highest standard of morality. Moreover, His salvation is carried out in the highest standard of morality. Therefore, we need to keep in mind that the subject of the Gospel of Luke is the Man-Savior and His salvation in the highest standard of morality. </p>

<p data-content-id="ov0pwXq8uOJOycOiF0aN9dWIpYzHGrTUx1Dbcc3jku5CrgeFN6HqgZR5btlLER604"> We need to see that the Lord Jesus is the Man-Savior. As the Man-Savior, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence. Unlike other biographies, Luke records the conception of the one whose life he records. Other biographies may speak of a person’s birth, but not his conception. In this matter, Luke is unique. He tells us how the Man-Savior was conceived. He was not conceived of a man; rather, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence. </p>
<p data-content-id="37AX-gTuAtUIfnNeOW6h5mlkDbtYWR3LTu6iLVxczyu6wYZF7FopoaS4d9S_W-BJ4"> The Holy Spirit is God Himself reaching man. This means that when God reaches man, He is the Holy Spirit. With the conceiving of the Man-Savior, the Holy Spirit came into humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="Gn7ewN6nSdByHJgqnTngUU0Oe-1UTJncAcUqo6emH0AAxLxRlyu8isObL6a-GDD-q"> We have pointed out that the Man-Savior was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence. Here we are using the word “essence” in a strong sense to denote something <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> even more intrinsic than nature. The essence is the intrinsic constituent of a certain substance. The Man-Savior was conceived of the Holy Spirit not only with the divine nature but with the divine essence. It is extremely important that we see this matter. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="crbZLnwlQe1t-R2NMGUjsLgIu5vZMDiBZWVp3fX5a8i7iFrksEzKqpk9CFqNeA0KZ">Born of a Human Virgin with the Human Essence</h2><p data-content-id="Y58zRdwVwZdOug4OgsXYUwui5YTN0tMwYIpE2xtAxeB5rWIwx_UI_h1Cxbmt9gLsn"> The Man-Savior was born of a human virgin with the human essence.

<p data-content-id="EnWCv_eiedBm6acXaSgA3jI36_MxGVx9OO_VMk3ydCyoMCmwj4AjjstBnWwxvP728"> Because the Man-Savior was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence and was born of a human virgin with the human essence, He has two essences, the divine and the human.

Therefore, He possesses both the divine nature with its divine attributes and the human nature with its human virtues.

<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="iKUb-yZjUMq0U5rbLwGQedyKhlmsitCl_HgCC1JygvKdbgTH8NQIWMexx8ZGM2f34">Gospel Parables</h2><p data-content-id="nV3M-hxr_PahH5f0EO3BPMrmHTm7hkZMtOU1wXRdLUKzbd2Rwvo4ANlkJXwIqXfdH"> The parable of the good Samaritan in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68029" data-verses="Luke 10:1">chapter ten</span> is an excellent example. When we come to this chapter, we shall see that this Samaritan signifies the Lord Himself, who was slandered by being called a low and mean Samaritan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68030" data-verses="John 8:48">John 8:48</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68031" data-verses="John 4:9">4:9</span>) by the self-exalting and self-justifying Pharisees. <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="6v5bqSZVkxM1HMGlQPBeNpm8O5Ww8o25b4qVQMP5MlzkvkTR8-sJeZYdiAzVYImAy"> According to this parable, a “certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who having stripped him and beat him, went away, leaving him half dead” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68032" data-verses="Luke 10:30">10:30</span>). Both a priest and a Levite observed him and then passed by on the opposite side. Then a certain Samaritan came down to him and was moved with compassion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68033" data-verses="Luke 10:33">v. 33</span>). “And coming to him, he bound up his wounds, pouring on them oil and wine. And placing him on his own beast, he brought him to an inn and took care of him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68034" data-verses="Luke 10:34">v. 34</span>). In this simple story, which even children may appreciate, we see that the Man-Savior lived in the highest standard of morality. He cared for the wounded man, brought him to the inn, and said to the innkeeper, “Take care of him; and whatever you spend in addition, when I return, I will repay you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68035" data-verses="Luke 10:35">v. 35</span>). This is not only a matter of love; it is also a living in the highest standard of morality. </p>
<p data-content-id="RZzGEogxd1MGIsl2YZ5kp2iHSdLcm5J3IdyqcTX_a5S28-G-Yz8OH2qUTV12ioiQD"> The three parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68036" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span> also illustrate the Man-Savior’s salvation in the highest standard of morality. These three parables form a full set. The good shepherd signifies God the Son as our shepherd, the woman signifies the Holy Spirit, and the loving father, of course, signifies God the Father. Hence, in these three parables we have the Trinity working together to seek, save, and receive a repentant sinner. The good shepherd loves the lost sheep, the woman treasures the lost coin, and the loving father receives the prodigal son when he returns. </p>
<p data-content-id="sd53dK7V3RACxeAhdZJarIvJWY7CXd4lKCZrOk5KHHUk8v9DyXsEuqfotQsdDEpDq"> Some readers of the Gospel of Luke may regard these parables merely as illustrating love. But we need to realize that it is Luke’s intention in his narration to portray the Divine Trinity full of the divine attributes shown in human virtues. In these parables we see not only the divine attributes, in particular, the attribute of love; we also see the divine attributes in human virtues. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="whXJpCNVhaMbONnpIp1lLEbV78Gr88OYrW5ZYazISocRSVFEj93Rh6WuKCXo2tcws">Gospel Cases</h2><p data-content-id="Lj54LQasZ-K8EIg0P9QBinZk1nfFprp5qpL9M39N7uxjTamFkVxVWNhxhdjVx7yWi"> The Man-Savior’s salvation in the highest standard of morality is also shown in the gospel cases recorded in Luke. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68037" data-verses="Luke 7:36-50">7:36-50</span> we have the case of the Lord Jesus forgiving a <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> sinful woman. This woman was despised by the Pharisee who had invited the Lord Jesus to eat with him. As we read this portion of the Gospel of Luke, we see that in dealing with this sinful woman, and also with the Pharisee, the Lord lived according to the highest standard of morality. </p>
<p data-content-id="mFzvXUhbhqpISr0cfCdgujl1AZG80kf7bH6haSXLEJRmHfrjBcKo82-9Gg2bAZ_94"> Another case that reveals the same high standard is the case of Zaccheus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68038" data-verses="Luke 19:1-10">19:1-10</span>). Although Zaccheus, a tax collector, was an evil person, he was seeking the Man-Savior. Because he was seeking Jesus, “he ran on ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree that he might see Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68039" data-verses="Luke 19:4">v. 4</span>). The Lord Jesus responded to Zaccheus, saying, “Zaccheus, hurry and come down; for today I must stay in your house” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68040" data-verses="Luke 19:5">v. 5</span>). The Man-Savior’s response must have far exceeded all that Zaccheus could have hoped for. The Man-Savior was not held back by the fact that Zaccheus was a despised man, one rejected by society. The Lord went with Zaccheus and stayed in his house. In His dealing with Zaccheus, the Man-Savior lived in the highest standard of morality. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZOnBpaevoPlkI92KPLGpCsDTUxvcifQzDL7AE4fhd-GIrB27yf8bZOWtB76IdtGDS"> Even when the Man-Savior was on the cross, He acted in the highest standard of morality in relation to the two criminals who were crucified with Him. One of the criminals said to the Lord Jesus, “Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68041" data-verses="Luke 23:42">23:42</span>). Immediately the Man-Savior answered, “Truly I tell you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68042" data-verses="Luke 23:43">v. 43</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="AUNZZyVVAVOomKPrqQmiXXO12JhGBpIJR1Zd6ilPf-0XAUbPCWwsUR_yeQ_zGl6pN"> In these three cases we have a portrait of the Man-Savior with the highest standard of morality. This is a crucial matter in the Gospel of Luke. This Gospel depicts a Man who possesses the divine nature with all the human virtues. In the Man-Savior the divine attributes are mingled with the human virtues as one unit. Therefore, the Lord’s human virtues, according to this Gospel, are strengthened and enriched by the divine attributes. </p>

While He was on earth, He lived a life <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> in the highest standard of morality. Such a life was a composition of the divine attributes and the human virtues. Of course, the Lord Jesus lived this kind of life outside the disciples. But from the time of His resurrection He has been living this kind of life within the believers. This means that within us today the Man-Savior is still living a life in the highest standard of morality, a life that is a composition of the divine attributes and the human virtues. If we see this, we shall say with Paul, “It is no longer I, but Christ lives in me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68043" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>). </p>

We have also seen this life displayed in different gospel cases. Suppose you had been the criminal who asked the Lord to save him, and He immediately gave you more than you had asked without any terms or conditions. Perhaps you would say, “Oh, what love this is!” Actually, it is not adequate to call this love. This is the highest standard of morality. </p>

<p data-content-id="WVNqXX68ZMdi0Is0I2irCaWMw6vNnBJsEhQPV8kOVHacHdtLj25qcwOhqs0Rn3f7G"> The subject of the Gospel of Luke is the Man-Savior and His salvation in the highest standard of morality.

This Man revealed God among men in His saving grace to fallen mankind. I like the expression “saving grace.” In the Gospel of Luke God is revealed in a Man who saves sinners by His grace. In this book we have a picture of a Man who is genuine, moral, and perfect, a Man who reveals God in His saving grace to fallen mankind. This Man did not reveal Himself. Instead, He revealed God in His saving grace. </p>

And they were both righteous in the sight of God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.” Zachariah and Elizabeth were God’s chosen people, preserved in the custody of the law in the Old Testament. They were brought forth by the <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> law to be useful to God for the initiation of the gospel in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="dvWnnIN7e0JKw-7c5L3xsqFKvbCR3lHyth-Z-qR8i3gE62O3MzE72ycw46N8mvBgO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68074" data-verses="Luke 1:6">1:6</span> we are told that Zachariah and Elizabeth were righteous in the sight of God. This does not contradict <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68075" data-verses="Romans 3:20">Romans 3:20</span>. Here “righteous” means to be right, blameless in the sight of God according to the Old Testament commandments and ordinances (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68076" data-verses="Luke 2:25">Luke 2:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68077" data-verses="Philippians 3:6">Phil. 3:6</span>). It does not mean that these righteous ones were not sinful, that they were without sin and sins. They were blameless, but they were not without blemish. They still needed the unblemished sin and trespass offerings in type (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68078" data-verses="Leviticus 4:28">Lev. 4:28</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68079" data-verses="Leviticus 5:15">5:15</span>) for their atonement that they might have contact with God. </p>

Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68080" data-verses="Luke 1:7">1:7</span> says, “And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in age.” This was sovereign of the Lord.

This indicates that Zachariah had prayed for his wife to bear him a son. This also indicates that our prayer carries out God’s operation. Moreover, it implies that our natural strength must be brought to an end so that God’s operation may begin by His divine act. This was revealed in the case of Abraham and Sarah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68091" data-verses="Genesis 17:15-19">Gen. 17:15-19</span>) and in the case of Hannah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68092" data-verses="1Samuel 1:5-20">1 Sam. 1:5-20</span>). </p>

Hence, the conception of John the Baptist was by the divine power in a miraculous way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68093" data-verses="Luke 1:19-20">vv. 19-20</span>). In Old Testament times God did this in bringing forth both Isaac and Samuel. Now in the case of John the Baptist, born of parents naturally unable to produce a child, God came in to enable them to have a son by His power. </p>

Instead of drinking wine, he would be filled with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit replaces the wine (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68100" data-verses="Ephesians 5:18">Eph. 5:18</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> </p>

But this chosen priest of God became a Nazarite in addition. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68101" data-verses="Numbers 6:1">chapter six</span> of Numbers, a Nazarite is not a chosen one; rather, a Nazarite is a volunteer. Therefore, John the Baptist had a dual status. On the one hand, as a priest he was chosen by God; on the other hand, as a Nazarite he was a volunteer. John volunteered himself to serve God. </p>

The Holy Spirit is the first divine title ascribed to the Spirit of God in the New Testament. Such a title was not used in the Old Testament. (In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68103" data-verses="Psalms 51:11">Psa. 51:11</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68104" data-verses="Isaiah 63:10-11">Isa. 63:10-11</span> “the Holy Spirit” should be translated “the Spirit of holiness.”) It was at this time, for the initiation of the gospel of God, to prepare the way for the Savior’s coming and to prepare a human body for Him, that this divine title of God’s Spirit was used. The preparing of the way for the Savior’s coming required that His forerunner be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb, so that he could separate the people unto God from all things other than God, making them holy unto Him for His purpose. The preparing of a human body for the Savior required that the Holy Spirit impart the divine nature into humanity, making man holy for the carrying out of God’s plan of redemption. </p>

This verse tells us that she was filled with the Spirit. There is no indication that she prayed or fasted in order to be filled with the Spirit. This verse simply says that Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. By being filled with the Spirit she blessed Mary, the mother of the Man-Savior. </p>

<p data-content-id="PIjOD0qFuTXceUSZuDWZDZcE0eeqSfaj3wRhOBw1FeXJDCmFaOPLe_ykOCcLaqUht"> It is significant that Elizabeth blessed the fruit of Mary’s womb. Instead of using the word “child,” Elizabeth used the word “fruit.” It is correct to say that the fruit here refers to a child. But this word also indicates that the Lord Jesus is fruit to us, the fruit for us to take in as our life supply. </p>
<p data-content-id="-L1fy_zrwSJXUU5n8unTQQRsvBf8gL-7zbw6oEqqqLY7uMvSfrnIP_SgjrRC490ZA"> Elizabeth also blessed Mary in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68164" data-verses="Luke 1:45">verse 45</span>: “And blessed is she who believed, because there shall be a completion of the things spoken to her from the Lord.” In contrast to the unbelieving Zachariah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68165" data-verses="Luke 1:20">v. 20</span>), Mary believed what the angel said to her. Elizabeth said to Mary that there would be a completion of the things spoken to her from the Lord.

<p data-content-id="WVNqXX68ZMdi0Is0I3CrBa2Mw6vNnBJsEhQPV8kOVHacHdtLj25qcwOhqs0Rn3f7G"> When the word fruit is used in the Scriptures to denote a child, it refers to humanity. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68170" data-verses="Luke 1:42">1:42</span> “fruit” refers to the Lord Jesus in His humanity. Now we see in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68171" data-verses="Luke 1:43">verse 43</span> that Elizabeth went on to recognize this human One as her Lord. <span class="pg" data-page-id="33" id="33">[33]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="2tNCATtNEU-uXYvQrMQ4mnXqLxK2yI2K223oVb_0w5iwpZu36YT9EiPenSev2WCos"> Elizabeth and Mary were cousins. No doubt, Elizabeth was much older than Mary. Nevertheless, this elderly woman recognized that the child of her younger cousin was her Lord. Even before His birth, Elizabeth recognized that the Lord Jesus, the Man-Savior, was both man and God. In her blessing, therefore, we have a revelation of the divine-human Person of the Man-Savior. </p>

The forerunner of the Man-Savior even exulted upon meeting the Savior, while both of them were still in their mothers’ wombs. Concerning this, Elizabeth says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68173" data-verses="Luke 1:44">verse 44</span>, “For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby leaped in my womb with exultation.” This is marvelous and beyond our understanding. </p>

This indicates that she was a godly woman, qualified to be a channel for the Savior’s incarnation. It also indicates that the Lord Jesus would grow up in a family which would be filled with the knowledge and love of God’s holy Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jgkr79uXp4nHSqPJyGYf1Ncwm7qGnaecC8bfNtJTx_m3Ubj0zJ3n8sOq8U2GgJfUN"> Although Mary was a young woman, she was very knowledgeable concerning the Old Testament and could quote verses from it in her praise to God. Actually, her praise was a composition of quotations from the Scriptures. Surely she was the right person for God to use in conceiving the Savior who was to be born. <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="zYdoNmJ8sJ3EfPJeCm3NgpbY9_7RUWZfgnhUmVfdTB_5mEQTlpUx_z2KThQMh-S0-"> Before Mary was visited by the angel to receive the word concerning the conception of the Man-Savior, she was already full of the knowledge of God’s Word. Many verses of the Scriptures had been absorbed into her being. Therefore, at the proper time she could pour out what was within her as she offered up praise to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="aJBHB16Du0i39s63u8r46mfcHmEpg--JpExe5woWN23707a7BR6E28G078JPrLzJy"> Mary’s praise indicates that in order for us to be used by God, we need to have certain qualifications. One qualification is the proper knowledge of the Word of God. I hope that the young people in particular will learn of Mary in this matter. Do you intend to be used by the Lord to bring forth something of the Lord, even, in a spiritual sense, to “conceive” the Lord Jesus and bring Him forth? If so, then you need to be qualified by being filled with the Scriptures, filled with the Word of God. </p>

Her praise to God was initiated from her spirit and then was expressed through her soul. Her spirit was filled with joy in God her Savior so that her soul manifested her joy for the magnification of the Lord. She lived and acted in her spirit, which directed her soul. Her exultation in God in her spirit was due to her enjoyment of God as her Savior, and her magnifying of the Lord in her soul was due to her exaltation of the Lord—Jehovah, the great To Be. </p>
<p data-content-id="y695EWmpNHnEWPC-uqz1A12J3jSUoQBFyaZAx96FqVB_sFX0OYnWKsHhj6JUg1n-e"> Mary’s spirit exulted in God. To exult is higher than to rejoice. It is significant that Mary said that her spirit exulted in God her Savior, rather than in God her Creator. She regarded God as more than her Creator; she considered Him her Savior. She realized that she was a created person who had become fallen. Therefore, she needed her Creator to be her Savior. <span class="pg" data-page-id="35" id="35">[35]</span> </p>

In content and standard, her praise is like some of the Old Testament Psalms. However, she does not say anything concerning Christ as does Elizabeth in her blessing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68179" data-verses="Luke 1:41-43">vv. 41-43</span>) and Zachariah in his prophecy through the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68180" data-verses="Luke 1:67-71">vv. 67-71</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68181" data-verses="Luke 1:76-79">76-79</span>). </p>

In these verses we see that Mary regarded God as both her Savior and Lord. We all need to experience what Mary experienced in knowing God as our Savior and Lord. When we enjoy God as our Savior, exulting in Him, then we shall magnify Him as our Lord. </p>

<p data-content-id="Jgkr79uXp4nHSqPJyGIfweswm7qGnaecC8bfNtJTx_m3Ubj0zJ3n8sOq8U2GgJfUN"> As we have begun to see, the preparation of the Man-Savior is in His humanity with His divinity. In principle, His preparation is the same as His conception, for in both the conception and the preparation we have the divine essence and the human essence. The conception of the Man-Savior was of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence in the womb of a human virgin with the human essence. In other words, the Lord’s conception was of the divine essence in the human essence. Likewise, His preparation was in His humanity with His divinity. How excellent, marvelous, and extraordinary is this preparation! </p>

We have pointed out that the conception of John the Baptist and that of Jesus the Savior are different in essence. The conception of John was God’s miracle, accomplished with the overaged human essence, simply by the divine power without the divine essence being involved. Therefore, the result of this conception was simply a man, one who was filled with <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> the Spirit of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68201" data-verses="Luke 1:15">1:15</span>) but who lacked the nature of God. The conception of the Man-Savior was God’s incarnation, constituted not only by the divine power, but also of the divine essence added to the human essence. Therefore, this conception produced the God-man, the One with two natures—divinity and humanity. </p>

God moved redemptively for the salvation of His people by raising Christ as a horn of salvation in the house of David in His humanity and as the rising sun from on high in His deity through God’s rich mercy according to His holy covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68213" data-verses="Luke 1:68-73">vv. 68-73</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68214" data-verses="Luke 1:76-79">76-79</span>). Zachariah’s prophecy brings in more light concerning the divine-human Person and the saving work of the Man-Savior than Elizabeth’s blessing brings in, yet it still bears an Old Testament color in the Old Testament style and flavor, just as that borne by Mary’s praise and Elizabeth’s blessing. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mixvss-j9tzRFTxyrep8FaxNaqOl6bARPohV1ILcl2Rfd6ZbvrtmR-ZjJ-Sa8BhLR"> Zachariah’s prophecy concerns God’s move. This is the move of God’s redemption for His people resulting in their salvation. By raising up Christ as a horn of salvation and as the rising sun, God’s redemptive work results in the salvation of His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="VnpGtuJZc2t4WkT0UafTqKQs9FrNE0CWBPCyIGrj5PYt8QUzResVcYufIW_qbioEP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68215" data-verses="Luke 1:69">1:69</span> Zachariah says, “And raised a horn of salvation for us in the house of David His servant.” This horn of salvation is Jesus the Savior, who came out of the house of David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68216" data-verses="Jeremiah 23:5-6">Jer. 23:5-6</span>). A horn signifies fighting power. Hence, the horn of salvation is the fighting power of God’s salvation <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> in the house of David. The phrase “the house of David” indicates that this salvation is in the humanity of the Man-Savior. </p>
<p data-content-id="iKUb-yZjUMq0U5rbLx2QVOCKhlmsitCl_HgCC1JygvKdbgTH8NQIWMexx8ZGM2f34"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68217" data-verses="Luke 1:70">verse 70</span> we see that the raising up of the horn of salvation was according to what God spoke “through the mouth of His holy prophets from of old.” This refers to God’s faithfulness in keeping His word. </p>
<p data-content-id="10Y2CNEKWaUAkDvQ3l8a80LffZ6_98e4N8ozCPPMzkmQPd2gHT1E_ldnAuur5g5vG"> After speaking of Christ in His humanity, Zachariah goes on to speak of Him in His deity: “Because of the merciful compassions of our God, in which the rising sun from on high shall visit us, to appear to those sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68218" data-verses="Luke 1:78-79">vv. 78-79</span>). Jesus the Savior is the dawning sun to the dark age. His coming ended the night of the Old Testament and began the day of the New Testament. As the fruit in Elizabeth’s blessing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68219" data-verses="Luke 1:42">v. 42</span>), He is life to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68220" data-verses="John 14:6">John 14:6</span>); as the sun in Zachariah’s prophecy, He is the light to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68221" data-verses="John 9:5">John 9:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68222" data-verses="Matthew 4:16">Matt. 4:16</span>). As such a One, He is the Accomplisher and the center of God’s redemption for His people’s salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="9ja0oN4pSUA1PfKrUR8CWxW84jNQuXvNrAFRd3n77So0-KjQ2N1zKueNosjiAaC8D"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68223" data-verses="Luke 1:78">1:78</span> Zachariah speaks of the Lord as the rising sun from on high. Whereas the horn of salvation is from the house of David, the rising sun is from on high, that is, from God. This means that it is in His deity that the Lord is the rising sun from on high. </p>
<p data-content-id="jXdlQ8xxZMxS77oeA_8s00vSEOMlQ9s1jH8YQMk7cEhKguIbR9jLLFm6wFfxpAM7f"> When we compare Zachariah’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68224" data-verses="Luke 1:69">verse 69</span> with that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68225" data-verses="Luke 1:78">verse 78</span>, we see that he speaks concerning Christ’s dual Person. He speaks concerning His humanity and His deity. In His humanity Christ is the horn of salvation raised up by God in a human house, the house of David. In His deity He is the rising sun from the heavens. The Lord, therefore, is both Man and God. As Man, He is the horn of salvation; as God, He is the rising sun. God’s redemptive work for the salvation of His people is accomplished by raising up Christ in the two aspects of the horn of salvation and the rising sun. </p>
<p data-content-id="TNosbqa7UDYgYcvACIc1sL5_AhIjoMFZ1RknVLQVa51Kalz7wwEWcHnDTjWi7J3AL"> God’s redemptive work is also through His mercy according to His holy covenant. Regarding this, Zachariah says, “To <span class="pg" data-page-id="43" id="43">[43]</span> show mercy to our fathers, and to remember His holy covenant, the oath which He swore to Abraham our father” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68226" data-verses="Luke 1:72-73">vv. 72-73</span>). Here Zachariah says that God remembered His covenant. This refers to God’s faithfulness in keeping His word, which was made His covenant by His oath. </p>
<p data-content-id="nV3M-hxr_PahH5f0EPHBNMrmHTm7hkZMtOU1wXRdLUKzbd2Rwvo4ANlkJXwIqXfdH"> God’s covenant is enacted upon His promise (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68227" data-verses="Hebrews 8:6">Heb. 8:6</span>). A promise is a common, ordinary word, a word without confirmation. In the Old Testament, after God made a promise, He sealed it with an oath. He swore by His Godhead to confirm His promise, by His oath thus making the promise His covenant. </p>
<p data-content-id="6v5bqSZVkxM1HMGlQOxePpm8O5Ww8o25b4qVQMP5MlzkvkTR8-sJeZYdiAzVYImAy"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68228" data-verses="Luke 1:74-75">verses 74 and 75</span> Zachariah goes on to say, “To grant us that, having been delivered out of the hand of our enemies, we might serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.” Literally, the word rendered “serve” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68229" data-verses="Luke 1:74">verse 74</span> means to serve as priests. This service will be in holiness and righteousness. Holiness is mainly toward God, and righteousness is mainly toward men. This Gospel stresses the humanity of Jesus. Hence, it singles out holiness and righteousness here as the main characteristics of human behavior toward God. </p>

This beginning was due to the fact that fallen mankind was fully occupied with its own fallen activities. We may say that the manger is a symbol of the Savior’s human living. </p>
<p data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IOOQlFycrPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW"> Luke presents a Man-Savior. Following the narration of His conception, Luke gives us, in this chapter, an excellent record concerning certain aspects of the Man-Savior’s human life. Luke describes His genuine human birth according to the law of God’s creation of man so that He might be a Man-Savior for the salvation of man. He gives an account of His physical circumcision according to the law of God’s ordination (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68255" data-verses="Luke 2:21-24">2:21-24</span>) so that He might be the legal seed of Abraham (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68256" data-verses="Genesis 17:9-14">Gen. 17:9-14</span>), to be the One in whom the promise of God to Abraham—“in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68257" data-verses="Genesis 12:3">Gen. 12:3</span>)—as the gospel preached to him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68258" data-verses="Galatians 3:8">Gal. 3:8</span>), could be carried out for all the nations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68259" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">Gal. 3:14</span>). In this chapter we see the Man-Savior’s human growth according to the law of human life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68260" data-verses="Luke 2:40">v. 40</span>), so that He might be a perfect Man to express God for the fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan. Finally, Luke records the Lord’s proper boyhood, the boyhood of the One who grew in the interest of God in relation to His deity as the Son of the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68261" data-verses="Luke 2:40-52">vv. 40-52</span>), so that He might have the full measure of wisdom, stature, and favor with God and men. <span class="pg" data-page-id="49" id="49">[49]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="kAQNthUaZvalgvsKHuzCdAMJbCrdyQWj0UWwMbQUlst1TdatH57vU3-PT1x1LNEeo"> The record in this chapter concerning the Savior’s birth and youth is completely different from that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68262" data-verses="Matthew 2:1">Matthew 2</span>. What Matthew records of events that took place at the Savior’s birth and during His youth constitutes striking evidence of Christ’s legitimate kingship. Luke’s record of the same birth and the same youth is of another category, that of events which offer strong proof of Jesus’ genuine humanity. The two records cover only two of the different aspects of the Savior’s wonderful status. Whereas Matthew’s record testifies that Christ is the proper King prophesied in the Scriptures, Luke’s record concerning the youth of Jesus proves that He is a proper man. The two are absolutely different. </p>

When the angel of the Lord stood by the shepherds and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, they feared greatly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68265" data-verses="Luke 2:9">2:9</span>).

This means that this news was announced not only to the Jewish people but to all of mankind. </p>

First He was introduced by John the Baptist (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68331" data-verses="Luke 3:1-20">vv. 1-20</span>), and then He was baptized (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68332" data-verses="Luke 3:21">v. 21</span>) and anointed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68333" data-verses="Luke 3:22">v. 22</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="37AX-gTuAtUIfnNeOXah81VkDbtYWR3LTu6iLVxczyu6wYZF7FopoaS4d9S_W-BJ4"> As we shall see, the inauguration of the Man-Savior mainly involves His being baptized by John the Baptist and His being anointed by the Father. Actually, this inauguration is an introduction, but it is more than merely an introduction. To introduce a person does not mean to officially put him into office. But to inaugurate a person means not only to introduce him, but also to usher him officially into his office. </p>
<p data-content-id="Gn7ewN6nSdByHJgqnSHgeH0Oe-1UTJncAcUqo6emH0AAxLxRlyu8isObL6a-GDD-q"> In the foregoing chapters, the Man-Savior was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin. Through His conception, birth, and youth He was prepared as a complete Person to be our Savior in His humanity with His divinity. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68334" data-verses="Luke 3:1">chapter three</span> it is necessary for Him to be introduced and ushered into His ministry. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68335" data-verses="Luke 3:1-22">3:1-22</span> we have a record of the inauguration of the Man-Savior. Regarding this inauguration, both John the Baptist and God the Father played a part. John did something on man’s side, and the Father did something on God’s side. </p>

Due to the impenitence of the Jews, both this word and the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68350" data-verses="Luke 3:9">verse 9</span> have been fulfilled. God has cut them off and raised up the believing Gentiles to be children unto Abraham in faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68351" data-verses="Romans 11:15">Rom. 11:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68352" data-verses="Romans 11:19-20">19-20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68353" data-verses="Romans 11:22">22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68354" data-verses="Galatians 3:7">Gal. 3:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68355" data-verses="Galatians 3:28-29">28-29</span>).

To those of the crowd who asked him what to do, John said, “He who has two tunics, let him share with the one who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68359" data-verses="Luke 3:11">v. 11</span>). To the tax collectors who came to be baptized, John said, “Exact no more than what you have been instructed” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68360" data-verses="John 13:1">v. 13</span>). To those serving in the military he said, “Extort nothing from anyone by force, nor take anything from anyone by false accusation, and be satisfied with your wages” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68361" data-verses="Luke 3:14">v. 14</span>). What John says here is related to morality. By this we see that in his Gospel Luke emphasizes morality because his intention is to present the Man-Savior in the highest standard of morality. </p>

He did not make himself the center of his ministry, as a magnet attracting others to himself. He realized that he was only a messenger sent by Jehovah of hosts to bring people to Jesus Christ and exalt Him as the goal of his ministry. </p>

Water signifies death and burial for the termination of repenting people; the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life and resurrection for the germination of terminated people. The first was a sign of John’s ministry of repentance; the latter, a sign of the Man-Savior’s ministry of life. John buried the repenting people into the death-water; the Man-Savior raised them up for their regeneration in the Spirit by His resurrection life. </p>

For the Lord Jesus to be baptized means that He put Himself aside. He allowed Himself to be put into death so that He might minister not in a natural way, but in the way of resurrection. Therefore, as a Man it was necessary for the Lord Jesus to put Himself aside in order that He might live God. </p>
<p data-content-id="zYdoNmJ8sJ3EfPJeCl3Njo7Y9_7RUWZfgnhUmVfdTB_5mEQTlpUx_z2KThQMh-S0-"> If we would have a proper understanding of the significance of the baptism of the Man-Savior, we need to consider further what is the highest standard of morality. The highest standard of morality is actually the result of the God-created man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68403" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Gen. 1</span>) with the human virtues created by God plus the tree of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68404" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Gen. 2</span>), a tree that signifies God as life to us with all His divine attributes.

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68405" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">chapter two</span> of Genesis, this God-created man with his human virtues was placed in front of the tree of life. The tree of life signifies God as life with His divine attributes. When the tree of life is added to the God-created man, the result is a living in the highest standard of morality. </p>

If we see this, we shall realize that not only does fallen man need to be set aside, but even the man created by God in His image needs to be set aside so that he may live a life that expresses God. Therefore, no matter what kind of person we may be, if we would live a life to express God, we need to be put aside. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68406" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Romans 8:3</span> Paul says that Christ came in the likeness of the flesh of sin.

On the one hand, He represented the God-created man; on the other hand, in appearance He represented fallen man. Have you ever realized that when the Lord Jesus came to be baptized by John, He represented the God-created man and, in outward appearance, the fallen man? We would emphasize the fact that the Lord Jesus did not have the actual nature of fallen man, but He did have the appearance of fallen man. Therefore, in actual nature He represented the God-created man, and in appearance, likeness, but not in nature, He also represented fallen man. In His actual human nature He represented the man created by God; in appearance He represented the man who had become fallen. </p>
<p data-content-id="_ZwqsA5v5sK5Gd_CAuEVx8U-oyUvJZvrd4_dLBztnh2YyrGo-ZQKJ0rrkSkFZAXKk"> We have seen that fallen man certainly needs to be judged, terminated, and buried. We have also seen that even the God-created man must be set aside in order to live a life in which the human virtues express the divine attributes. For this, even a good, complete, and perfect God-created man must be set aside. This is the reason that the Lord Jesus as the God-man said in the Gospel of John that He did not do anything by Himself. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68407" data-verses="John 5:19">John 5:19</span> He said, “The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68408" data-verses="John 5:30">John 5:30</span> He said again, “I can do nothing from Myself.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68409" data-verses="John 8:28">John 8:28</span> the Lord declared, “I do nothing from Myself.” </p>

Both as a God-created man and as a fallen man, we need to be terminated. The first aspect of the Man-Savior’s inauguration into His ministry for God was for Him to be set aside. We also need to be terminated and buried in the waters of death. </p>

Before the Holy Spirit in power descended upon Him, He already had the Holy Spirit in essence from His birth. Furthermore, while the Holy Spirit in power was descending upon Him, He was existing with the Holy Spirit in essence. </p>

Therefore, with the Lord Jesus there is the matter of His Person and the matter of His ministry. For His Person He had the Holy Spirit as His intrinsic essence from the time of His conception.

<p data-content-id="9ja0oN4pSUA1PfKrUS8CVw284jNQuXvNrAFRd3n77So0-KjQ2N1zKueNosjiAaC8D"> Christ as the wonderful center of the Bible is all-inclusive, having many aspects. The New Testament at its beginning presents four biographies to portray the four main aspects of this all-inclusive Christ. The Gospel of Matthew testifies that He is the King, the Christ of God according to the prophecies of the Old Testament, the One who brings the kingdom of the heavens to earth. The Gospel of Mark presents Him as the Slave of God, the One who <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> labors for God faithfully. Mark’s account is most simple, for a slave does not need a detailed record. The Gospel of Luke presents a full picture of Christ as the only proper and normal man who ever lived on earth, and thus the Savior of mankind. The Gospel of John unveils Him as the Son of God, the very God Himself, to be life to God’s people. Among the four Gospels, Matthew and Luke have a record of genealogies; Mark and John do not. To testify that Jesus is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, Matthew needs to show us the antecedents and status of this King, proving that He is the proper successor to the throne of David. To prove that Jesus is a proper and normal Man, Luke needs to show the generations of this Man, attesting that He is qualified to be the Savior of mankind. For the record of a slave, Mark does not need to tell us His origin. To unveil that Jesus is the very God, neither does John need to give us a human genealogy. Rather, John declares that as the Word of God He is the very God in the beginning. </p>

For this reason, the genealogy of Christ in Matthew begins with Abraham, the father of the called race, not with Adam, the father of the created race. God’s kingdom is built not with the created race of Adam, but with the called race of Abraham, including both the real Israelites (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68434" data-verses="Romans 9:6-8">Rom. 9:6-8</span>) and the believers in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68435" data-verses="Galatians 3:7">Gal. 3:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68436" data-verses="Galatians 3:9">9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68437" data-verses="Galatians 3:29">29</span>).

<p data-content-id="sd53dK7V3RACxeAhdb5arJvJWY7CXd4lKCZrOk5KHHUk8v9DyXsEuqfotQsdDEpDq"> We need to be impressed with the fact that the genealogy of the Lord Jesus in Matthew begins with Abraham and comes down to Christ, whereas the genealogy in Luke traces backward from Jesus to God. In Luke’s genealogy four names are especially striking: God, Adam, Abraham, and Jesus. We were created by God, we became fallen in Adam, we received God’s promise in Abraham, and we were saved in Jesus who is Christ. Therefore, we were created, we became fallen, we received the promise, and we have been saved. We can praise the Lord for God, Abraham, and Jesus. After we were created by God and became fallen in Adam, we received the promise of God’s salvation in Abraham. Then in Jesus, who is Christ, we have been saved. This is a summary of the genealogy of our Man-Savior. </p>

The Lord Jesus was strong, and He could withstand temptation. We, on the contrary, are not able to withstand temptation at all. We should not be proud, thinking that because we have the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit we are now able to withstand temptation.

Even though we have been regenerated and to some extent sanctified and transformed, we nevertheless are not able to withstand the temptation of the evil one. Therefore we need to pray, “O Father, do not lead me into temptation.” No matter how strong we may feel, we actually are weak and cannot stand Satan’s temptation.

<p data-content-id="Cx-Kq8f_kufcXTjbP-whAs18OaHzT6d8wbuRcXv4ortX3gIXqwulpXeobzCQdoJJ1"> In the first three and a half chapters of the Gospel of Luke we see that two angels and a number of human beings were involved in the preparation of the Man-Savior. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68485" data-verses="Luke 1:30-35">1:30-35</span> we have the prophecy of the archangel Gabriel, who came to Mary and told her that God intended that she conceive the Man-Savior. In that prophecy Gabriel spoke of four matters concerning the coming Man-Savior. First, Gabriel said that the Man-Savior would be called Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68486" data-verses="Luke 1:31">1:31</span>), which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah. Second, Gabriel indicated that the coming Man-Savior would be called Son of the Most High (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68487" data-verses="Luke 1:32">v. 32</span>), a title that refers to His deity. Third, Gabriel said, “The Lord God will give to Him the throne of David His father” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68488" data-verses="Luke 1:32">v. 32</span>). Here we see that in His humanity the coming Savior was to be a descendant of David. Fourth, the archangel Gabriel refers to the coming Savior as “the holy thing” which is to be born and who will be called Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68489" data-verses="Luke 1:35">v. 35</span>). Therefore, according to Gabriel’s word, the Man-Savior is Jesus, the Son of the Most High, a descendant of David, and the holy thing. </p>

In these verses Elizabeth says, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And how can this be, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?” Here Elizabeth speaks of the Man-Savior as the fruit of Mary’s womb and as the Lord. The “fruit” refers to His humanity, and “Lord” refers to His deity. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68493" data-verses="Luke 1:76">verse 76</span> Zachariah also refers to the Man-Savior as the Lord. The horn of salvation refers to the Lord’s humanity; the rising sun from on high denotes His divinity. Zachariah knew that his son, John, would prepare the way for this One, who is the Lord. </p>

The first of the angels was the archangel Gabriel. Gabriel is noted for bringing good news to God’s people. Gabriel brought good news not only in Luke, but also in Daniel, where he spoke concerning the seventy weeks (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68499" data-verses="Daniel 9:24-27">Dan. 9:24-27</span>). The second angel was the one who made the announcement to the shepherds concerning the birth of the Man-Savior. It is possible that this one who made the announcement was also Gabriel. However, it is my belief that it was a different angel who announced the Lord’s birth. </p>

For man to be created in God’s image means that man is created according to God’s attributes. God is love and light, and He is also holy and righteous.

However, the man created by God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68502" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> merely bore God’s image. He did not have God within him.

These verses begin the third major section of the Gospel of Luke. The first section is the introduction (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68516" data-verses="Luke 1:1-4">1:1-4</span>), and the second concerns the preparation of the Man-Savior in His humanity with His divinity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68517" data-verses="Luke 1:5">1:5—4:13</span>). The third section, which is quite lengthy, covers the ministry of the Man-Savior in His human virtues with His divine attributes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68518" data-verses="Luke 4:14">4:14—19:27</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68519" data-verses="Luke 4:14">4:14—9:50</span> we have the ministry of the Man-Savior in Galilee.

We have seen that the preparation of the Man-Savior was in His humanity with His divinity. The conception, birth, and growth of the Man-Savior were all in His humanity with His divinity. After undergoing a full preparation, He began to minister. Like His preparation, His ministry was in His humanity with His divinity. In particular, His ministry was not only in His humanity but in His human virtues, and not only with His divinity but also with His divine attributes. The Man-Savior ministered in His human virtues with His divine attributes. <span class="pg" data-page-id="90" id="90">[90]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68521" data-verses="Luke 7:36-50">7:36-50</span> a sinful woman came into the home of a Pharisee who had invited the Lord Jesus to eat with him. As we read the account of this incident, we see that Jesus, the Man-Savior, conducted Himself in His human virtues. He was not at all bothered by that sinful woman, even when “she began to wet His feet with her tears, and to wipe them with the hair of her head” and when “she kissed His feet affectionately and anointed them with the ointment” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68522" data-verses="Luke 7:38">v. 38</span>). If we had been the Lord Jesus, we probably would have been troubled by the behavior of this woman. We might have said to her, “Don’t you know that I am a guest in this house? Can’t you see that I am eating?” However, to act in that way would be to fail to act in the proper human virtues. In this situation the Man-Savior was very kind and patient, realizing that this woman had been convicted of her sins. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lj54LQasZ-K8EIg0O9gBimZk1nfFprp5qpL9M39N7uxjTamFkVxVWNhxhdjVx7yWi"> He was also merciful. People often speak about love, but rarely about mercy. Mercy, however, is more tender than love. To be merciful is to sympathize with others in their poor condition and low estate. </p>
<p data-content-id="mFzvXUhbhqpISr0ceCtguil1AZG80kf7bH6haSXLEJRmHfrjBcKo82-9Gg2bAZ_94"> In addition to exercising kindness, patience, and mercy toward the woman, the Lord Jesus also exercised His understanding. Often we fail to understand others, but the Lord Jesus was very understanding in the case of this woman. Furthermore, He was wise and loving. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZOnBpaevoPlkI92KOL2pCtDTUxvcifQzDL7AE4fhd-GIrB27yf8bZOWtB76IdtGDS"> Perhaps you are wondering what divine attributes are expressed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68523" data-verses="Luke 7:36-50">7:36-50</span>. First, here we have the divine forgiveness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68524" data-verses="Luke 7:47-48">7:47-48</span>). God is the only one who can grant forgiveness of sins. He alone is qualified to forgive sins. Therefore, forgiveness is one of the divine attributes. </p>
<p data-content-id="AUNZZyVVAVOomKPrrQWiXUO12JhGBpIJR1Zd6ilPf-0XAUbPCWwsUR_yeQ_zGl6pN"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68525" data-verses="Luke 7:50">7:50</span> the Lord Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.” The giving of peace is also a divine attribute. God is the only one who can give inner peace. </p>
<p data-content-id="FyPO0Bs_RXrorVGaubddDrLFgpUWneMjMpEk0aYSfanBP0SA21ajMTzZdZb6Sdt3F"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68526" data-verses="Luke 7:36-50">7:36-50</span> we see the Man-Savior in the house of a <span class="pg" data-page-id="91" id="91">[91]</span> Pharisee acting in His human virtues with His divine attributes. He could behave in such a manner because He was the God-man. We may say that He was a man equipped by God and with God. He possessed all the human virtues created by God, and He also had the divine attributes. Hence, He acted in the highest standard of morality, for His human virtues expressed His divine attributes. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Cx-Kq8f_kufcXTjbP-ghJ_18OaHzT6d8wbuRcXv4ortX3gIXqwulpXeobzCQdoJJ1">The Parable of the Good Samaritan</h2><p data-content-id="PIjOD0qFuTXceUSZvCGZDYcE0eeqSfaj3wRhOBw1FeXJDCmFaOPLe_ykOCcLaqUht"> The Man-Savior’s human virtues and divine attributes are also revealed in the parable of the good Samaritan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68527" data-verses="Luke 10:25-37">10:25-37</span>). The good Samaritan signifies the Man-Savior. It is easy to see the human virtues of the Samaritan, but where in this parable do we see the divine attributes? The Lord’s divine attributes are seen in the Samaritan’s bringing the wounded one to an inn. “And on the next morning, taking out two denarii, he gave them to the innkeeper and said to him, Take care of him; and whatever you spend in addition, when I return, I will repay you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68528" data-verses="Luke 10:35">10:35</span>). Here we see something of the Lord’s divine attributes. Who besides God can do things in such an unexpected, unanticipated way? If this One were not God, how could He have spoken these words to the innkeeper? The Lord’s doing the unexpected may be considered an expression of His divine attributes. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="-L1fy_zrwSJXUU5n9v3TQTRsvBf8gL-7zbw6oEqqqLY7uMvSfrnIP_SgjrRC490ZA">The Lord’s Word to the Thief</h2><p data-content-id="pQRuKAJlDonWZe7uSZxG1fCH2ZE-H030jYTeXH3ooRncRbKpIKHOqeYDJyj9C--Un"> The Lord also acted in His human virtues with His divine attributes when He was on the cross. The thief said to Him, “Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68529" data-verses="Luke 23:42">23:42</span>). The Lord replied, “Truly I tell you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68530" data-verses="Luke 23:43">v. 43</span>). Here we see the human virtues expressing the divine attributes. In the Lord’s word to the thief we see not merely the human virtues, but also the divine attributes manifested in the Lord’s human virtues. Although He was a man, He was filled with all the divine attributes. Therefore, He could act in His human virtues with His divine attributes. These illustrations should <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> help us understand how the Lord ministered in His human virtues with His divine attributes. </p>

<p data-content-id="f5f0VDzn9jkRQSn1Oy1f_bxwlK3eq6Siv45D3Z1PVOSaG41wTyIuG2c1MeKQAjvFj"> Man’s fall into sin broke his fellowship with God, making all men ignorant of the knowledge of God. Such ignorance issued first in darkness and then in death.

His teaching released the word of light to enlighten those in the darkness of death so that they might receive the light of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68538" data-verses="John 1:4">John 1:4</span>). The teaching of the Man-Savior was to bring people out of satanic darkness into the divine light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68539" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>). </p>

According to His custom, He entered on the Sabbath day into the synagogue and stood up to read. The book, the scroll of the prophet Isaiah, was handed to Him. Then He opened the scroll and found the place where it was written, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to <span class="pg" data-page-id="93" id="93">[93]</span> the blind, to send away in release those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68540" data-verses="Luke 4:18-19">4:18-19</span>). After the Lord closed the book and gave it back to the attendant, He sat down. Then He said to the people, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your ears” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68541" data-verses="Luke 4:21">v. 21</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IOPRVFxcLPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW"> Here we see that the Spirit of the Lord was upon the Man-Savior because God had anointed Him to bring good news to the poor. The Greek word rendered “bring good news” is <em>euaggelizo,</em> which means to evangelize, to announce good news. To preach the gospel was the first commission of the Savior as God’s anointed One, the Messiah. The good news was to be preached to the poor, that is, to the poor in heavenly, spiritual, and divine things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68542" data-verses="Luke 12:21">12:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68543" data-verses="Revelation 3:17">Rev. 3:17</span>; see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68544" data-verses="Matthew 5:3">Matt. 5:3</span>). </p>

In the word of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68599" data-verses="Luke 4:19">4:19</span>, He proclaimed the acceptable year of the Lord. This is the New Testament age typified by the year of jubilee (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68600" data-verses="Leviticus 25:8-17">Lev. 25:8-17</span>). The year of jubilee was the fiftieth year, the conclusion of a half century. Thus, according to the book of Leviticus, at the end of every half century there was to be a year called the year of jubilee and also called the acceptable year. The acceptable year signifies the year for the Lord to accept people. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68601" data-verses="Isaiah 61:1">chapter sixty-one</span> of Isaiah there is a prophecy concerning the fulfillment of this jubilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="0yMFLpTNFijhdJXKYAdsYHr0HDyobmW8BsYvNv_3Cioz9unzd69fVMg-p6C0n6Ifp"> It is not likely that before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68602" data-verses="Luke 4:1">Luke 4</span> the Jews understood Isaiah’s word concerning the acceptable year of the Lord. One day the Lord Jesus entered into the synagogue and read from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68603" data-verses="Isaiah 61:1">Isaiah 61</span> regarding the acceptable year of the Lord. The acceptable year is the jubilee of Jehovah. </p>

Fifty years is the length of the entire life of a fallen <span class="pg" data-page-id="98" id="98">[98]</span> person. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68604" data-verses="Psalms 90:10">Psalm 90:10</span> Moses said that the days of our years are threescore years and ten, and by reason of strength they may be fourscore years. According to Moses, the length of human life is seventy years. If someone is strong, he may live to the age of eighty. According to the Bible, in one sense a person’s life may be regarded as beginning at the age of thirty, the age at which a priest began to function. Even the Lord Jesus was thirty years old when He began to minister (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68605" data-verses="Luke 3:23">3:23</span>). Thirty plus fifty equals eighty. Hence, a half century, fifty years, signifies the length of a person’s life in the fallen nature. As the fiftieth year, the year of jubilee is the conclusion of our entire fallen life. </p>
<p data-content-id="454lFLK2tydPg5el-HGBbdHpHQtD5QB0eD81SP4uSuDpX_AQORq44Je3A02kXbzxC"> What happened to us in our fallen life? We lost our birthright, sold ourselves into captivity, and became slaves. We lost everything, including our birthright and our status. </p>

In fact, to such a one, the jubilee might be a suffering. But the one who has lost everything, including his land and himself, would surely look forward to the year of jubilee. When the year of jubilee came, he would rejoice at being released and recovering the right to his portion of the land. </p>

Therefore, to lose one’s right to the good land is to lose the right to enjoy Christ. Every fallen human being has lost the right to enjoy God as the tree of life and the right to enjoy Christ as the good land. Furthermore, every fallen one has sold himself to sin, the world, and Satan. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68606" data-verses="Romans 7:14">Romans 7:14</span> Paul said of himself, “I am fleshly, sold under sin.” Even Paul had become a slave to sin. </p>

A partial gospel tells people that they are sinners destined for hell, but Jesus loved them and died on the cross for them, and that if they believe in Him they will have eternal life. This is only a part of the jubilee. The jubilee is a proclamation of release from slavery and of the recovery of our spiritual birthright. This jubilee is the acceptable year of the Lord. </p>

The good land is actually more mysterious than the tree of life, for the good land is the fulfillment of the tree of life. Adam did not eat of the fruit of the tree of life, but the children of Israel partook of the riches of the good land. Today we are enjoying the Triune God as the tree of life, and, even the more, we are enjoying Christ as the good land. Praise the Lord that we have an allotment of this good land! According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68608" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">Colossians 1:12</span>, this allotment is the portion of the saints. This proves that our birthright, which had been lost, has been recovered in the New Testament jubilee. </p>

Since the New Testament age is the real year of jubilee, this means that God will restore us to our original condition. In Adam we became lost, and we sold ourselves to sin as slaves. But now Jesus, the Man-Savior, has come, and He has brought in the acceptable year of the Lord. This acceptable year of the Lord is, in the New Testament, the fulfillment of the Old Testament jubilee. In this year we are released, and our lost birthright is recovered, redeemed, and restored. </p>

The order of Mark’s record, showing that Jesus is the Servant of God, is according to history. The order of Matthew’s record, proving that Christ is the King of the kingdom of the heavens, is according to doctrine, with certain instances put together to present a doctrine. The order of Luke’s record, revealing that Jesus is the proper man to be our Savior, is according to morality. </p>

Immediately following, we have the case of the cleansing of a man full of leprosy, the cleansing of a contaminated one. Peter was not only an occupied person but also a contaminated person.

When people are busy with their occupation, they may think that they are very good. But when they are released from their occupation to follow the Lord, they realize that they are sinful. Furthermore, after they are cleansed, they realize that they are paralyzed with respect to God and the things of God. They are not able to walk in God’s way. But after they are healed, they come to see that they are “tax collectors,” despised persons considered to be of no value.

And immediately the leprosy left him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68677" data-verses="Luke 5:13">v. 13</span>). In this case the Lord acts in the highest standard of morality. Here we see that the Man-Savior sympathized with the leper. According to the Old Testament, a leper was not to be touched by anyone. In order to keep others away from him, a leper was required to cry out, “Unclean, unclean!” Hence, a leper was altogether isolated. But the Man-Savior stretched forth His hand to touch this leper. The Lord’s touching the leper reveals His human virtue. </p>

In this case the Lord’s human virtues express His divine attributes. </p>
<p data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IOPR1FyfrPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW"> According to the scriptural examples, leprosy comes from rebellion and disobedience. Miriam became leprous because of her rebellion against God’s deputy authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68678" data-verses="Numbers 12:1-10">Num. 12:1-10</span>). Naaman’s leprosy was cleansed because of his obedience (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68679" data-verses="2Kings 5:1">2 Kings 5:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68680" data-verses="2Kings 5:9-14">9-14</span>). All fallen human beings have become leprous in the sight of God because of their rebellion. But the Man-Savior has come to save men from their rebellion and to cleanse them from their leprosy. </p>
<p data-content-id="kAQNthUaZvalgvsKGvjCeBsJbCrdyQWj0UWwMbQUlst1TdatH57vU3-PT1x1LNEeo"> A leper, according to the law, was to be excluded from the people because of his uncleanness. No one could touch him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68681" data-verses="Leviticus 13:45-46">Lev. 13:45-46</span>). But the Man-Savior touched the one full of leprosy. What mercy and sympathy! By His one touch, “immediately the leprosy left him.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Jgkr79uXp4nHSqPJzHof1Mcwm7qGnaecC8bfNtJTx_m3Ubj0zJ3n8sOq8U2GgJfUN"> A leper portrays a typical sinner. Leprosy is the most contaminating and damaging disease, isolating its victim both from God and men. To cleanse the leper signifies to recover the sinner to the fellowship with God and with men. <span class="pg" data-page-id="110" id="110">[110]</span> It is significant that the leper was not only healed but cleansed. The one with leprosy not only requires healing as those with other diseases; he also needs cleansing, as from sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68682" data-verses="1John 1:7">1 John 1:7</span>), because of the filthy and contaminating nature of the disease. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68684" data-verses="Luke 5:20">5:20</span> He said to the paralytic, “Man, your sins have been forgiven you!” When the scribes and Pharisees heard this, they began to reason, saying, “Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68685" data-verses="Luke 5:21">v. 21</span>). The Lord Jesus exercised His divine authority to forgive the paralytic’s sins and His divine power to heal him. But in this case we also see the exercise of the Lord’s kindness, which is a human virtue. Therefore, in this case also the Lord’s human virtue expresses His divine attribute. </p>
<p data-content-id="baXaoDjM31g4vdogLOY_AnJsY6kl2rRDOpin976WeiNY5gEGyluhr_T3XIAmn92Sv"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68686" data-verses="Luke 5:24">Luke 5:24</span> says, “In order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins—He said to the paralyzed one, To you I say, rise and pick up your cot, and go to your home.” The Man-Savior was the very God incarnated, not regarding equality with God a thing to be grasped. He was outwardly in the likeness and fashion of man, but inwardly He was God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68687" data-verses="Philippians 2:6-7">Phil. 2:6-7</span>). He was the Man-Savior and the God-Savior as well. Hence, He had not only the ability to save sinners, but also the authority to forgive their sins. In this incident, He forgave the paralytic’s sins as God, but asserted that He was the Son of Man. This indicates that He was the true God and a real Man, possessing deity and humanity. In Him, men can see both His divine attributes and His human virtues. </p>

<p data-content-id="8rK9hZU17CqFQv_7b-MMdVjV076l38frJWrb3fYskUnsCbvB8WxSNVgXi8Bko75qT"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68688" data-verses="Luke 5:27-39">5:27-39</span> we have the case of the calling of a despised tax collector named Levi or Matthew. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68689" data-verses="Luke 5:27">Verse 27</span> says, “And after these things He went out and beheld a tax collector <span class="pg" data-page-id="111" id="111">[111]</span> named Levi, sitting at the tax office, and He said to him, Follow Me.” The tax office was a tollhouse, where Matthew collected taxes for the Romans. Matthew was one of the tax collectors (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68690" data-verses="Matthew 10:3">Matt. 10:3</span>), probably in a high position, a man who was condemned, despised, and abhorred by the Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68691" data-verses="Luke 18:11">Luke 18:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68692" data-verses="Matthew 5:46">Matt. 5:46</span>). Yet he was called by the Man-Savior and was later chosen and appointed as one of the twelve apostles. What mercy! </p>
<p data-content-id="0yMFLpTNFijhdJXKYANsSXL0HDyobmW8BsYvNv_3Cioz9unzd69fVMg-p6C0n6Ifp"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68693" data-verses="Luke 5:28">Luke 5:28</span> says of Matthew, “And leaving all, he rose up and followed Him.” It seems that this was the first time the Lord met Matthew. There must have been some attracting power with the Lord, either in His word or appearance, that caused Matthew to follow Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="7WKyJ1T_uHk5hAsLORc1rIcFJj4I670thJCRuFLar2G9usySzvd5B-MQRqEDy9EDO"> We have pointed out that the Jewish people despised the tax collectors because they were collecting taxes for the Roman imperialists. They were considered traitors, and the Jews were disgusted with them and despised them to the uttermost. Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus came to one of these tax collectors and called him. </p>

This portion of the Gospel of Luke covers two matters: the Lord’s appointing twelve apostles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68711" data-verses="Luke 6:12-16">vv. 12-16</span>) and His teaching His disciples the highest morality (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68712" data-verses="Luke 6:17-49">vv. 17-49</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="SlZ9LfzTj9oNzJ6-saC1Oqm-FtUqhJ-Hu1E2vmyVDkctfWDUrJm1vTh_wbOlz4rGj">APPOINTING TWELVE APOSTLES</h2><p data-content-id="gIbolEPmx05b9aaM-ItXXvD6mLMAfdyt6RkK1EfHgPUcUpUKFw_EQp0WLDUU4a_bg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68713" data-verses="Luke 6:12">Luke 6:12</span> says, “And it came about in these days that He went out to the mountain to pray, and He spent the whole night in prayer to God.” On the next day, He called His disciples and chose twelve to be His apostles. The Lord Jesus prayed in order to have fellowship with God and seek God’s will and pleasure concerning His ministry. The Man-Savior did not carry out His ministry by Himself in a way that was independent of God or according to His own will. Rather, He fulfilled His ministry according to God’s will and pleasure by being one with God to fulfill His purpose. In particular, the Lord Jesus did not appoint the twelve by Himself. In this matter He acted as a man who was one with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="eZHFLAbNWwOTr1-IruSDhzdBlkr6ZBJMGzugC7yI_anSHrEw64TAXVbz6cBzraKtb"> When the Lord Jesus was baptized, He put Himself aside. This indicates that in His ministry He would not do anything by Himself, but would do everything by God and with God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68714" data-verses="Luke 6:12">6:12</span> we have the application of the Lord’s baptism. In His prayer the Lord rejected Himself and put Himself aside. In the crucial matter of appointing certain ones to be <span class="pg" data-page-id="118" id="118">[118]</span> His helpers, to be the apostles sent out to reach others, the Lord did not act in Himself or by Himself. He did this absolutely in God and with God. The main point in the choosing of the twelve as described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68715" data-verses="Luke 6:13-16">6:13-16</span> is that the Lord Jesus set Himself aside and did not act by Himself. In appointing the twelve, He acted in God, by God, and with God. </p>

Hence, there were two groups with the Lord as He was teaching. The first group was His disciples; the second was the crowd of unbelievers. We need to remember this if we would understand the Lord’s teaching here. Sometimes His word refers to the believers, and at other times it refers to the unbelievers. </p>
<p data-content-id="gIbolEPmx05b9aaM-ItXe9D6mLMAfdyt6RkK1EfHgPUcUpUKFw_EQp0WLDUU4a_bg"> Much of the Lord’s teaching in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68719" data-verses="Luke 6:17-49">6:17-49</span> is similar to that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68720" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapters five through seven</span> of the Gospel of Matthew. Whatever is decreed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68721" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">Matthew 5—7</span>, as the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, constitutes the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. Whatever is cited in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68722" data-verses="Luke 6:20-49">Luke 6:20-49</span>, as principles of the character of God’s children, governs and measures the behavior of the believers, who have been born of God and possess His life and nature. At the time of speaking, this portion, except <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68723" data-verses="Luke 6:24-26">verses 24 through 26</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68724" data-verses="Luke 6:39">39</span>, applied to the believing remnant of the Jews. </p>
<p data-content-id="eZHFLAbNWwOTr1-IruSDphNBlkr6ZBJMGzugC7yI_anSHrEw64TAXVbz6cBzraKtb"> We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68725" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapters five through seven</span> of Matthew we have the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens. The teaching in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68726" data-verses="Luke 6:1">chapter six</span> of Luke is not a constitution, but it is the principles of the character of those who believe in the Lord, of those who have been born of God and possess His life and nature. As those who have been regenerated by God, we, the believers, have God’s life and nature. Now we need to see what principles should govern our character, our behavior. How should we conduct ourselves? How should we act and have our being? The principles given in this chapter answer these questions. All the aspects of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="119" id="119">[119]</span> Lord’s teaching here are principles that should govern our Christian behavior. If we see this, we shall see the difference between the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68727" data-verses="Matthew 5:1-7">Matthew 5 through 7</span> and the principles of Christian behavior in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68728" data-verses="Luke 6:1">Luke 6</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5xKEgdpuEwfEMeypOU5XxTKMqK2Fa2tvJZgq5hBR6INjxpLJ7ifzk23cJPGz7OALQ">FOUR CHARACTERISTICS OF BLESSED PEOPLE</h2><p data-content-id="NIP9vcQSpsaW9kg2zIXratOUIxlFrb3RZvwz6cWaDdxDBDLgKxxI62zDhQMwvPdhT"> The first principle in these verses is that we who believe in Christ and who have been born of God should be a people blessed by God. We should be a blessed people, not a cursed people. As a result of the fall, mankind came under the curse. But in the jubilee of grace the Lord Jesus has rescued us from the curse and has brought us into God’s blessing. Hence, we should be a people blessed by God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68729" data-verses="Luke 6:20-23">6:20-23</span> there are four characteristics of blessed people. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="tm_3_WpwudCvX6CkRpoA4tXM1GTBpy9OgG7uBMDbsNsUIce-CSAdVjV8DKlJDOLGv">Poor</h2><p data-content-id="hR1Jkh6fGpavWnsBRy6fAlaA95DtKL_27Gp4pGUAt4ZXghu0FgoVfq59grebM748A"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68730" data-verses="Luke 6:20">verse 20</span> the Lord Jesus says, “Blessed are the poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.” In this verse “poor” has two denotations. First, it denotes poor in material things; second, it denotes poor in spiritual things. Therefore, the word poor here indicates poor in earthly, material things and also poor in heavenly, spiritual things. </p>
<p data-content-id="UwoI3MPYw_sWGgTUeS47VyFGshtzOQ5LUvhTMmv7LdK1FIytONjnEzyH0ZWFVMBnz"> It is often difficult for those who are rich in earthly, material things to be poor in heavenly, spiritual things. If someone chosen and called by God becomes rich in material things, it may be very difficult for that one to become poor in spiritual things. It may even be necessary for God to take away that person’s material riches in order that he might become poor in relation to spiritual things. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mixvss-j9tzRFTxyqe58GYRNaqOl6bARPohV1ILcl2Rfd6ZbvrtmR-ZjJ-Sa8BhLR"> If we would be a blessed people, we need to be poor. Mainly we need to be poor in spiritual things, in heavenly things. Concerning spiritual things, we should sense that we have nothing, that we are poor. </p>
<p data-content-id="VnpGtuJZc2t4WkT0VaPTqLQs9FrNE0CWBPCyIGrj5PYt8QUzResVcYufIW_qbioEP"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68731" data-verses="Matthew 5:3">Matthew 5:3</span> speaks of being poor in spirit. To be poor in spirit is not only to be humble, but also to be emptied in our spirit, in the depths of our being, not holding on to the old <span class="pg" data-page-id="120" id="120">[120]</span> things. To be poor in spirit also means to be unloaded to receive new things. </p>
<p data-content-id="iKUb-yZjUMq0U5rbKxmQVPCKhlmsitCl_HgCC1JygvKdbgTH8NQIWMexx8ZGM2f34"> Our human spirit, the deepest part of our being, is the organ for us to contact God and to realize spiritual things. We need to be poor, emptied, unloaded, in this part of our being so that we may realize and possess the kingdom of God. All the time we need to be poor in our spirit, having the sense deep within that we are poor in relation to spiritual things, in relation to the things concerning God. If we are poor in this way and humble, immediately the kingdom of God becomes our blessing. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="10Y2CNEKWaUAkDvQ2lsa81LffZ6_98e4N8ozCPPMzkmQPd2gHT1E_ldnAuur5g5vG">Hungry Now</h2><p data-content-id="9ja0oN4pSUA1PfKrVRsCWwW84jNQuXvNrAFRd3n77So0-KjQ2N1zKueNosjiAaC8D"> The second characteristic of a blessed people is to hunger now: “Blessed are those who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68732" data-verses="Luke 6:21">6:21a</span>). This verse speaks of spiritual hunger. First we realize that we are poor in spiritual things, and then we hunger after the things we lack in the spiritual realm. </p>
<p data-content-id="jXdlQ8xxZMxS77oeB_ss03vSEOMlQ9s1jH8YQMk7cEhKguIbR9jLLFm6wFfxpAM7f"> The Lord says that those who hunger now will be satisfied. When we hunger, we shall be filled. We shall be satisfied with the spiritual riches of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="TNosbqa7UDYgYcvADIM1sI5_AhIjoMFZ1RknVLQVa51Kalz7wwEWcHnDTjWi7J3AL">Weeping Now</h2><p data-content-id="nV3M-hxr_PahH5f0FPXBMNLmHTm7hkZMtOU1wXRdLUKzbd2Rwvo4ANlkJXwIqXfdH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68733" data-verses="Luke 6:21">6:21b</span> the Lord Jesus says, “Blessed are those who weep now, for you shall laugh.” This is the third characteristic of those who are blessed by God. In this verse to weep means to repent and to regret. To weep in this sense means that we are not happy about our spiritual situation and condition. Therefore, we regret and repent and desire to have a change in our spiritual condition. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="6v5bqSZVkxM1HMGlROheOoG8O5Ww8o25b4qVQMP5MlzkvkTR8-sJeZYdiAzVYImAy">Hated</h2><p data-content-id="RZzGEogxd1MGIsl2ZYZkq0CHSdLcm5J3IdyqcTX_a5S28-G-Yz8OH2qUTV12ioiQD"> The fourth characteristic is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68734" data-verses="Luke 6:22-23">verses 22 and 23</span>: “Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they separate you from them and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; <span class="pg" data-page-id="121" id="121">[121]</span> for in the same manner their fathers did to the prophets.” Here we see that it is a blessing to be hated and reproached for the sake of the Son of Man. We, however, like to be praised by others and to be valued, honored, and highly regarded by them. We need to realize that believers will be hated and evil spoken of by the world. The reason for this is that the entire world is following Satan, and we are following the Lord to go in the opposite way. Because our way is opposite to that of the world, the worldly people will hate us and speak evil about us. </p>

<p data-content-id="9ja0oN4pSUA1PfKrVR8CdiG84jNQuXvNrAFRd3n77So0-KjQ2N1zKueNosjiAaC8D"> If we live in a humble spirit under the Lord’s ruling, we shall always judge ourselves, not others. God’s children will be judged with what they judge. If they judge others with righteousness, they will be judged by the Lord with righteousness. If they judge others with mercy, they will be judged by the Lord with mercy.

<p data-content-id="HjWwmoGOlsak0TUDSCy_sclVb6Y9pPEtBKlHqojq6TpIxbKDnyfW41Pa33wfqt__Y"> Years ago I heard what C. H. Spurgeon said in a sermon on forgiveness. In that sermon he pointed out that it is difficult for Christians to forgive others. He said that we may think that we have forgiven someone. However, our forgiveness can be compared to burying a dead dog and allowing the tail to show. After forgiving someone, we may <span class="pg" data-page-id="126" id="126">[126]</span> say, “So-and-so offended me, but I have forgiven him.” This is to show the “tail” of the “dog.” </p>
<p data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IOPQVFydrPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW"> If we have really forgiven someone, we should also forget the offense. Once we have forgiven someone in a matter, we should not mention it again. Every time we mention an offense which supposedly has been forgiven, we are pulling out the tail of the buried dog to show others that the dog has been buried. If we do this, it indicates that we have not released the one who offended us. </p>
<p data-content-id="kAQNthUaZvalgvsKGuDCdBMJbCrdyQWj0UWwMbQUlst1TdatH57vU3-PT1x1LNEeo"> According to the New Testament, to forgive means to forget and to release. We need to forget the offense and release the offender. Once we have done this, we should never speak of the matter again. </p>

R. Vincent has pointed out that here “bosom” denotes “the gathered fold of the wide upper garment, bound together with the girdle, and thus forming a pouch.” Here the Lord is saying that when we give to others, our Father in heaven will always return to us much more than we give. </p>
<p data-content-id="aJBHB16Du0i39s63v8745m_cHmEpg--JpExe5woWN23707a7BR6E28G078JPrLzJy"> I once heard of a saint who was considering giving a particular gift to someone. In this case the gift was a number of fish. First this saint had the thought of giving away ten fish. But the more he thought about it, the more he reduced the number. At a certain point he realized that the thought of giving less was a temptation from the enemy. Becoming angry with the Devil, he said to him, “Satan, if you keep on tempting me, I will give away everything.” This illustrates our need for the willingness to give. If we give to others, we shall receive in return. What we measure to others will also be measured to us. </p>

How can you say to your brother, Brother, allow me to take out the speck in your eye, not seeing the log that is in your own eye? Hypocrite, first take the log out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck in your brother’s eye.” As children of God living in a humble spirit, we should first take the log out of our own eye whenever we look at the speck in our brother’s eye. The speck in our brother’s eye should remind us of the log in our own eye. As long as the log remains in our eye, our sight is blurred, and we shall not see clearly. </p>

But he who hears and does not do is like a man building a house upon the earth without a foundation, against which the river broke, and immediately it collapsed; and the crash of that house was great.” Here the house refers both to our being and to our work, our conduct. If our being is according to the Lord’s word, it will have a proper foundation. Likewise, if our work is based on the Lord’s word, it will have a solid foundation. If our being and our work are based upon the Lord’s word, they will be able to withstand any kind of test, any “flood” or “river.” But if our being and our work are not founded on the Lord’s word, the river will carry them away. </p>

And a certain centurion’s slave, who was highly valued by him, was ill and about to die.” A centurion was an officer over one hundred in the Roman army. This centurion represents the believing Gentiles, who are saved through faith in the Lord’s word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68799" data-verses="Luke 7:7">v. 7</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="ZOnBpaevoPlkI92KOKGpK_TTUxvcifQzDL7AE4fhd-GIrB27yf8bZOWtB76IdtGDS"> Having heard about Jesus, this centurion “sent to Him elders of the Jews, requesting that He might come and bring his slave safely through his illness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68800" data-verses="Luke 7:3">v. 3</span>). When these elders reached Jesus, “they entreated Him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that You should grant this to him.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68803" data-verses="Luke 7:8">verse 8</span> we have a further word of the centurion conveyed to the Lord Jesus through his friends: “For I also am a man set under authority, having under myself soldiers; and I tell this one, Go, and he goes; and another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68804" data-verses="Luke 7:8">v. 8</span>). </p>

I am under the authority of others, and others are under my authority. All I need to do is speak a word to one of the soldiers, and he does what I say.

<p data-content-id="VnpGtuJZc2t4WkT0VavTpLws9FrNE0CWBPCyIGrj5PYt8QUzResVcYufIW_qbioEP"> How did this Roman centurion, a Gentile, come to know the Lord’s authority? According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68806" data-verses="Luke 7:5">verse 5</span>, he loved the Jewish nation and built a synagogue for the Jews. From this we see that probably he had some knowledge of the Old Testament. Furthermore, he referred to the Man-Savior as Lord. Hence, he realized that the Man-Savior was the One who has the genuine authority. </p>
<p data-content-id="iKUb-yZjUMq0U5rbKxGQWPiKhlmsitCl_HgCC1JygvKdbgTH8NQIWMexx8ZGM2f34"> The centurion also knew the significance of a word of authority. This was the reason he could say to the Man-Savior, “Say a word, and let my servant be cured” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68807" data-verses="Luke 7:7">v. 7</span>). He knew authority and the word as the expression of authority. The centurion’s slave was in fact healed by the word of the Man-Savior. </p>

Thus, he believed not only in the Man-Savior, but also in His word. He asked the Lord not to come personally, but only to send His word. The Man-Savior marveled at this great faith. <span class="pg" data-page-id="137" id="137">[137]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="9ja0oN4pSUA1PfKrVRMCVx284jNQuXvNrAFRd3n77So0-KjQ2N1zKueNosjiAaC8D"> In this case also we see the Lord’s human virtues with His divine attributes. His virtue was expressed in the fact of His going to the home of the centurion. The Lord Jesus is the Lord of the entire universe. Nevertheless, He was willing to go to see an officer in the Roman army. The centurion had only one hundred soldiers under his authority, but the Lord Jesus has the whole universe under His authority. In the Man-Savior’s human virtue, His divine attribute of authority was expressed. He spoke a word, and the centurion’s slave was healed. Here we see the Lord’s divine attribute manifested in His human virtue. </p>

Now as He came near the gate of the city, behold, one who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a considerable crowd from the city was with her.” This situation was very sad, and no one could do anything to comfort the grieving widow. First she had lost her husband, and now she had lost her only son. </p>
<p data-content-id="nV3M-hxr_PahH5f0FP3BPOrmHTm7hkZMtOU1wXRdLUKzbd2Rwvo4ANlkJXwIqXfdH"> This case was unique in its misery—the only son of a widow was being carried in the coffin. The Savior’s compassion was also unique in His loving sympathy. He volunteered, in His tender mercy, His power of resurrection to raise the widow’s son from death, without being asked to do so. This indicates His unique commission, coming to save lost sinners (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68811" data-verses="Luke 19:10">19:10</span>), and shows the high standard of His morality, as a Man-Savior, in saving sinners. </p>

And approaching, He touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. And He said, Young man, I say to you, arise! And the dead man sat up and began to speak; and He gave him to his mother.” Here we see the Man-Savior’s compassion in speaking to <span class="pg" data-page-id="138" id="138">[138]</span> the widow and in touching the coffin. When He touched the coffin, those who were carrying it stood still. Then the Lord commanded the dead son of the widow to arise. This is the Lord’s divine attributes expressed in His human virtues. </p>
<p data-content-id="RZzGEogxd1MGIsl2ZY5kq2CHSdLcm5J3IdyqcTX_a5S28-G-Yz8OH2qUTV12ioiQD"> In His compassion, the Man-Savior spoke to the widow and touched the coffin. He was not asked to do these things. But seeing the situation, He initiated the action that caused the dead son to be raised up. To the great surprise of those present, the Lord initiated this action according to His human virtue. What caused Him to be moved with compassion? The cause of this was His human virtue. Then in His human virtue His divine attributes were expressed by raising the young man from the dead. </p>
<p data-content-id="sd53dK7V3RACxeAhcYJaoIPJWY7CXd4lKCZrOk5KHHUk8v9DyXsEuqfotQsdDEpDq"> Again we see that the Lord Jesus is full of the human virtues and of the divine attributes. In His raising up the dead son and giving him to his mother, we see the expression of the Man-Savior’s divine attributes in His human virtues. </p>
<p data-content-id="whXJpCNVhaMbONnpJo1lIF7V78Gr88OYrW5ZYazISocRSVFEj93Rh6WuKCXo2tcws"> Luke, who wrote his Gospel according to the sequence of morality, put together the two cases of the healing of the centurion’s slave and the raising up of the widow’s son. In the case of the healing of the centurion’s slave we see the Lord’s authority, but in the case of the raising up of the widow’s son we see His affection. When the Lord touched the coffin, He showed His sympathy, affection, and love. Therefore, the first case is a matter of authority; the second case is a matter of affectionate sympathy. In both cases we see the Man-Savior in His human virtues with His divine attributes. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lj54LQasZ-K8EIg0O8QBhm5k1nfFprp5qpL9M39N7uxjTamFkVxVWNhxhdjVx7yWi"> Actually, in both cases we see the authority of the Man-Savior. Saying a word that the centurion’s servant may be healed implies authority. However, the authority expressed here is not as high as that expressed in the raising up of the widow’s son. When we put these two cases together, we see that the Man-Savior, the God-man, was full of human virtues with the divine attributes. </p>

It seemed that the One with authority and sympathy would not do anything for John. Instead, it was as if He had forgotten him. The disciples of John may have been bothered by this, and they reported to him concerning all these things. They may have been troubled by the fact that the Man-Savior, who healed the centurion’s slave and raised up the widow’s son, was not doing anything for John the Baptist. </p>

First we see that sinners are forgiven not because of their love, but because of their faith in the Lord. Faith, not love, is what causes us to experience the forgiveness of sins. Second, the saved ones, those whose sins have been forgiven, follow the Lord and minister to Him. Third, those who have been forgiven and who now love the Lord, follow Him, and minister to Him should grow in life and shine as lamps. Fourth, eventually such ones become the genuine relatives of the Man-Savior. From this we see that the four matters covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68857" data-verses="Luke 7:36">7:36—8:21</span> go together in our spiritual experience. In this message we shall consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68858" data-verses="Luke 7:36-50">7:36-50</span>, and in the following message we shall cover <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68859" data-verses="Luke 8:1-21">8:1-21</span>. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68860" data-verses="Luke 7:36-50">7:36-50</span> Luke presents in a very effective way a case of the forgiveness of sins. Here we have a vivid description of a sinful woman experiencing the forgiveness of sins. This portion of the Gospel of Luke is an affectionate account of the case of the forgiveness of sins. <span class="pg" data-page-id="144" id="144">[144]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="uZQjh9ACdCObo73nBj6mSZADnu18yBYq6-Sf_S2e8ePelXrhqcHNu9IrQr-mDbhX0">A Pharisee and a Sinful Woman</h2><p data-content-id="y695EWmpNHnEWPC-vqD1C12J3jSUoQBFyaZAx96FqVB_sFX0OYnWKsHhj6JUg1n-e"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68861" data-verses="Luke 7:36">Luke 7:36</span> says, “Now a certain one of the Pharisees asked Him that He would eat with him. And entering into the Pharisee’s house, He reclined at the table.” In this verse Luke does not say that the Pharisee prepared a feast and invited the Lord Jesus to eat with him. Instead, Luke tells us that the Pharisee asked the Savior to eat with him. This may indicate the Pharisee asked the Lord in a rather cold manner; that is, he did not give Him a warm invitation full of affection. Nevertheless, the Man-Savior went into the Pharisee’s house to eat with him. </p>
<p data-content-id="8rK9hZU17CqFQv_7b_MMeUDV076l38frJWrb3fYskUnsCbvB8WxSNVgXi8Bko75qT"> For whose sake did the Man-Savior go to the Pharisee’s house? Did He do this for the sake of the Pharisee or for the sake of the woman? I believe that He did this for the sake of both the Pharisee and the woman. In His omniscience the Man-Savior knew that the woman would come into the house. We may say that by accepting the Pharisee’s request that He eat in his house, the Lord afforded the woman an opportunity to contact Him. Otherwise, this woman who was sinful and who was known for her sinfulness may not have had a way to contact the Savior. By accepting the Pharisee’s request to come to his house to eat, the Lord gave an opportunity to this saved sinner to express her love for Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="0yMFLpTNFijhdJXKYBNsRVr0HDyobmW8BsYvNv_3Cioz9unzd69fVMg-p6C0n6Ifp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68862" data-verses="Luke 7:36-50">7:36-50</span> Luke does not tell us what the host did to the Lord. There is nothing to indicate that the Pharisee was polite and loving toward Him. Actually, Luke does not say very much about the host. However, he has much to say concerning what the woman did to the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="7WKyJ1T_uHk5hAsLOQc1oK8FJj4I670thJCRuFLar2G9usySzvd5B-MQRqEDy9EDO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68863" data-verses="Luke 7:37-38">Verses 37 and 38</span> say, “And behold, there was a woman in the city who was a sinner, and learning that He was reclining at the table in the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster flask of ointment; and she stood behind Him at His feet weeping, and she began to wet His feet with her tears, and to wipe them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet affectionately and anointed them with the ointment.” The hair is the glory of the woman (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68864" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:15">1 Cor. 11:15</span>), the top part of her body. With her top part she wiped the <span class="pg" data-page-id="145" id="145">[145]</span> Savior’s feet, the lowest part of His body, loving Him with her glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="_ZwqsA5v5sK5Gd_CBt0Vx_U-oyUvJZvrd4_dLBztnh2YyrGo-ZQKJ0rrkSkFZAXKk"> The woman kissed the Lord’s feet affectionately, that is, in love, and she anointed them with the ointment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68865" data-verses="Luke 7:38">v. 38</span>). This ointment indicates the great worth and sweetness of the Savior to the woman. Even the Savior’s feet were worthy and sweet to her. </p>
<p data-content-id="B-xax8NKp7LCijI7WvwMm9Jos3kSlmvYlicWUqjousBPGePPVlOH7nulgHhpJQvmR"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68866" data-verses="Luke 7:39">verse 39</span> we see that the Pharisee criticized the woman and despised her: “But when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he said within himself, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, because she is a sinner.” A considerable crowd in Nain, having witnessed the Man-Savior’s power of resurrection, recognized Him as a great prophet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68867" data-verses="Luke 7:16">7:16</span>). Yet the Pharisee wondered if He were a prophet. He not only doubted concerning the Savior, but also despised the woman as a sinner. </p>
<p data-content-id="xdxTxFZ3QLG06tmoVbwONLKoarNeZMRzYj39H4NLabyTJr4rWTMePzQvvgQ8LEOaY"> By His divine attribute of omniscience, the Man-Savior knew what His host was saying in his heart. Because He is God, He knows what is in man’s heart. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68868" data-verses="Luke 7:40">Verse 40</span> says, “And Jesus answered and said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you.

But having nothing to repay, he graciously forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him more?” The Lord’s word here indicates that both Simon and the woman were sinners. Simon considered the woman a sinner, but did not consider himself a sinner, and he doubted that the Savior knew that she was a sinner. But the Savior’s parable indicated that both Simon and the woman were sinners, debtors to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="QS_uuvFcVjx6uGVtOuOBZAQnlYKY1jnXQkbZwmBnmy1XcRsI7z2kVs1C7kIjs7vSf"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68870" data-verses="Luke 7:42">verse 42</span>, when the two debtors had nothing to repay the moneylender, he graciously forgave them both. This indicates that all sinners have nothing to repay their <span class="pg" data-page-id="146" id="146">[146]</span> debt to God their Savior. The Lord’s word here also indicates that the Savior had already forgiven them both. </p>
<p data-content-id="K6HmpZJGTPRsiY1ag1uYCD534UlqtsBFDVHQgSo9S8is_l13ggA-7Yse3XgT2zYV3"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68871" data-verses="Luke 7:42">verse 42</span> the Lord Jesus asked Simon which of the debtors would love the moneylender more as a result of having been forgiven by him. This indicates that love to the Savior is the issue, not the cause, of His forgiveness. </p>
<p data-content-id="lXx03sAZnH1566ErJ9Ak8LmN6YjVqHNC8OyUynANn47kviFgaPXvRFBN-BRclOuC0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68872" data-verses="Luke 7:44-46">verses 44 through 46</span> the Lord went on to say to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered into your house; you did not give Me water for My feet, but this woman has wet My feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair. You did not give Me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing My feet affectionately. You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with ointment.” The Savior’s word in these verses indicates that Simon should take the woman as an example and learn of her. </p>
<p data-content-id="O6A_Zpet8NpkAD123ynVL9396Jkgmribh2Ghh9n9QaeX9vJyetjJM0RwCL0BYvdJK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68873" data-verses="Luke 7:47">verse 47</span> the Lord said, “For this reason I say to you, her sins which are many have been forgiven, because she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, he loves little.” The great love of the woman was a proof that her many sins had been forgiven. Simon’s little love testified that he had experienced forgiveness only a little. </p>

This shows the Savior’s tender care for the dead and sinful, and it conveys the principle of morality as the unique characteristic of this Gospel. </p>

The Greek word rendered “bringing good news” is <em>euaggelizo,</em> which means evangelize, to announce good news, to declare glad tidings, to preach the gospel. Therefore, to bring good news of the kingdom of God is to preach the kingdom of God as the good news, as the gospel. </p>

It may have been that, under the Lord’s sovereignty, the husbands of these women were wealthy. We may say that this wealth was the result of the Lord’s exercise of His divine attributes. Then the women exercised their human virtues to use their possessions to minister to the Lord and His disciples. </p>

The women, however, ministered both to the Lord and to the disciples in a practical way. In the church life sometimes the sisters are more practical than the brothers are. Whereas the brothers may find it easy to speak, the sisters will often serve, minister, in a practical way. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68911" data-verses="Luke 8:5-8">verses 5 through 8</span> four kinds of soil are mentioned. As we shall see, these kinds of soil signify four conditions of the human heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="AUNZZyVVAVOomKPrrSGiXXO12JhGBpIJR1Zd6ilPf-0XAUbPCWwsUR_yeQ_zGl6pN"> When the disciples questioned the Lord concerning this parable (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68912" data-verses="Luke 8:9">v. 9</span>), He said, “To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables, in order that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68913" data-verses="Luke 8:10">v. 10</span>). This verse indicates that God’s economy concerning His kingdom was a hidden mystery, a mystery which has been unveiled to the Man-Savior’s disciples. Because the nature and character of the kingdom of God are wholly divine and because the elements through which it is brought forth are the divine life and divine light, the kingdom of God, especially in its reality as the genuine church in this age (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68914" data-verses="Romans 14:17">Rom. 14:17</span>), is still all a mystery to the natural man. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="FyPO0Bs_RXrorVGauZNdDoLFgpUWneMjMpEk0aYSfanBP0SA21ajMTzZdZb6Sdt3F">Four Kinds of Hearts</h2><p data-content-id="Cx-Kq8f_kufcXTjbP8whK-V8OaHzT6d8wbuRcXv4ortX3gIXqwulpXeobzCQdoJJ1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68915" data-verses="Luke 8:11-15">Luke 8:11-15</span> we see four kinds of hearts into which the seed is sown. The first kind of heart is likened to the soil “beside the road” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68916" data-verses="Luke 8:5">v. 5</span>). Concerning this, the Lord says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68917" data-verses="Luke 8:12">verse 12</span>, “Those beside the road are those who heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and be saved.” The earth beside the road is the earth on the wayside. This earth has been hardened by a great deal of traffic. As a result, wheat cannot grow in that kind of soil. <span class="pg" data-page-id="154" id="154">[154]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="PIjOD0qFuTXceUSZvAWZAZ8E0eeqSfaj3wRhOBw1FeXJDCmFaOPLe_ykOCcLaqUht"> A heart that is like the wayside, like the soil beside the road, is a heart in which there is too much traffic of worldly business. If our heart is occupied with making a living, there will be too much traffic in our heart. The result will be that our heart will not be the proper soil for the growing of Christ, for it will be a heart hardened by worldly traffic. </p>
<p data-content-id="-L1fy_zrwSJXUU5n9tnTTRxsvBf8gL-7zbw6oEqqqLY7uMvSfrnIP_SgjrRC490ZA"> A second kind of heart is likened to rocky ground (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68918" data-verses="Luke 8:6">8:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68919" data-verses="Luke 8:13">13</span>). This kind of ground has soil on the surface, but underneath it is full of rocks. It is not possible for Christ to grow in this kind of heart. A person with such a heart may receive Christ and be saved; however, it will be difficult for him to grow in life. Because of the rocks, it is difficult for Christ to grow in the heart signified by the rocky ground. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68920" data-verses="Matthew 13:5">Matthew 13:5</span> describes this kind of heart as rocky places, which do not have much earth. This signifies the heart that is shallow in receiving the Lord’s word. Such a heart is shallow because deep within are “rocks”—hidden sins, personal desires, self-seeking, and self-pity—which frustrate the seed from gaining root in the depths of the heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="pQRuKAJlDonWZe7uSbhG2diH2ZE-H030jYTeXH3ooRncRbKpIKHOqeYDJyj9C--Un"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68921" data-verses="Luke 8:7">Luke 8:7</span> says. “And other seed fell in the midst of the thorns, and the thorns sprouted up with it and choked it.” Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68922" data-verses="Luke 8:14">verse 14</span> explains: “And that which fell into the thorns, these are those who heard, and they are choked by the ongoing anxieties and riches and pleasures of life, and do not bring any fruit to maturity.” Here we see clearly that the “thorns” signify anxieties, riches (in particular, the deceitfulness of riches—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68923" data-verses="Matthew 13:22">Matt. 13:22</span>), and the pleasures of life. These things choke the word and prevent it from growing in the heart and becoming fruitful. </p>
<p data-content-id="vOVAPClIw9o-SMbO8PVlH2yn2shm1hmqQ-J4zvC1dCk_Dq1MQU0ZikmVpJu7Jramo"> The fourth kind of heart is that signified by the good earth: “And other seed fell into the good earth, and having sprouted up, it produced fruit a hundredfold” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68924" data-verses="Luke 8:8">v. 8</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68925" data-verses="Luke 8:15">verse 15</span> the Lord explains, “But that in the good earth, these are those who in a noble and good heart hear the word, and hold it fast, and bear fruit with endurance.” This good earth signifies the good heart, a heart that is not hardened by worldly traffic, that does not have hidden sins, and that is without the anxiety of the age, the deceitfulness of riches, <span class="pg" data-page-id="155" id="155">[155]</span> and the pleasures of life. Such a heart gives all the ground to receiving the word so that the word may grow, bear fruit, and produce even a hundredfold. </p>
<p data-content-id="WVNqXX68ZMdi0Is0J0CrCaWMw6vNnBJsEhQPV8kOVHacHdtLj25qcwOhqs0Rn3f7G"> A heart without worldly traffic, rocks, and thorns is a purified heart. This kind of heart is good for growing Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="2tNCATtNEU-uXYvQqPQ4lk3qLxK2yI2K223oVb_0w5iwpZu36YT9EiPenSev2WCos"> After we have been forgiven and have begun to live a life in peace, we should follow the Lord and minister to Him. Then according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68926" data-verses="Luke 8:4-15">8:4-15</span>, we need to deal with our hearts. </p>

This portion of the Gospel of Luke covers three matters: the quelling of the storm (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68950" data-verses="Luke 8:22-25">8:22-25</span>), the casting out of a legion of demons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68951" data-verses="Luke 8:26-39">vv. 26-39</span>), and the healing of a woman with a flow of blood and the raising up of a dead girl (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="68952" data-verses="Luke 8:40-56">vv. 40-56</span>). </p>

In Mark they are put together in order to show the authority of the kingdom of God. By the authority of the kingdom, the storm is calmed, the demons are defeated, the sick are healed, and the dead are raised. In Matthew the same three matters are put together in order to show a dispensational change. But in Luke these things are put together in order to show the journey we must make as those who believe in the Lord Jesus and follow Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="QS_uuvFcVjx6uGVtOtuBRQgnlYKY1jnXQkbZwmBnmy1XcRsI7z2kVs1C7kIjs7vSf"> We have seen from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68953" data-verses="Luke 7:36">7:36—8:21</span> that the Christian life begins with the forgiveness of sins and continues with living in peace, following the Lord, ministering to His need, and growing in life so that we may shine. Eventually, we become the Lord’s real relatives, His members. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68954" data-verses="Luke 8:22-56">8:22-56</span> Luke goes on to show that those who believe in the Lord are on a <span class="pg" data-page-id="160" id="160">[160]</span> journey with Him. This journey is not chosen by us; rather, it is ordained by the Savior. </p>
<p data-content-id="dvWnnIN7e0JKw-7c4JXxsqFKvbCR3lHyth-Z-qR8i3gE62O3MzE72ycw46N8mvBgO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68955" data-verses="Luke 8:22">Luke 8:22</span> indicates that the journey of which we are speaking is ordained by the Lord: “And it came about on one of the days that He got into a boat, and His disciples; and He said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake; and they launched out.” Here we see that the Lord told the disciples to go over to the other side of the lake. This indicates that the journey was not initiated by the disciples, but was ordained by the Lord. This indicates further that after we become the Lord’s relatives, the members of His Body, we do not have the right to choose our own way. Instead, we must take the way chosen by Him, the way ordained by Him. The disciples, therefore, launched out at the Lord’s word. He said, “Let us go over to the other side of the lake,” and they took His word and launched out. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="QS_uuvFcVjx6uGVtOtuBZCQnlYKY1jnXQkbZwmBnmy1XcRsI7z2kVs1C7kIjs7vSf">The Lord Rebuking the Wind<br/>and the Raging of the Water</h2><p data-content-id="K6HmpZJGTPRsiY1ag2OYBDZ34UlqtsBFDVHQgSo9S8is_l13ggA-7Yse3XgT2zYV3"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68956" data-verses="Luke 8:23-24">Verses 23 and 24</span> tell us what happened on the journey: “And as they sailed, He fell asleep. And a whirlwind came down upon the lake, and they were filling with water and were in danger. And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing! And He, being awakened, rebuked the wind and the raging of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm.” Here we see that while the Lord was asleep, a whirlwind came down upon the lake, and the boat was being filled with water. The disciples were frightened and called on the Lord. The Lord awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. </p>
<p data-content-id="lXx03sAZnH1566ErJ-gk_LGN6YjVqHNC8OyUynANn47kviFgaPXvRFBN-BRclOuC0"> Why did the Lord rebuke the wind and the raging of the water? Why would He rebuke something that is without life? He rebuked the wind and the water because behind them were evil spirits and demons. The evil spirits are in the air, and the demons are in the water. Both the evil spirits and the demons follow Satan and trouble us in our journey as we follow the Lord. This means that the evil spirits and the demons will cause a “storm” to frustrate us in our journey. <span class="pg" data-page-id="161" id="161">[161]</span> </p>

And they were afraid and marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this, that He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him?” Here we see that after quelling the storm, the Lord rebuked the disciples, asking them, “Where is your faith?” </p>

If we did not have a word from the Lord, we would not have any basis for our faith. The Lord’s word produces faith. Faith, therefore, is based on the word of the Lord. What was the word given to the disciples by the Lord in this instance? It was the word, recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68958" data-verses="Luke 8:22">verse 22</span>: “Let us go over to the other side of the lake.” Since the Lord had spoken this word, certainly He would fulfill it. </p>
<p data-content-id="37AX-gTuAtUIfnNePU6h6mFkDbtYWR3LTu6iLVxczyu6wYZF7FopoaS4d9S_W-BJ4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68959" data-verses="Luke 8:22-25">8:22-25</span> the disciples had not only the Lord’s word but the Lord Himself. He was with the disciples in the boat. In that situation the disciples had the word of the Lord and the Lord Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="Gn7ewN6nSdByHJgqmRngXXUOe-1UTJncAcUqo6emH0AAxLxRlyu8isObL6a-GDD-q"> Since the disciples had both the Lord’s word and His presence, they should have been at peace, not caring about the storm. The Lord had told them to go to the other side of the lake, and the Lord was with them in the boat. They should not have been frightened by the storm. </p>
<p data-content-id="crbZLnwlQe1t-R2NNEUjvIAIu5vZMDiBZWVp3fX5a8i7iFrksEzKqpk9CFqNeA0KZ"> Our trouble as today’s followers of the Lord is that when a storm comes we often forget the Lord’s word. Furthermore, instead of looking at the Lord, we may look at the storm. We all need to learn that whenever we are on a journey following the Lord and a storm arises, we should look at the sleeping Lord and not at the storm. We should not care for the storm—we should care for the Lord’s word. The Lord has said, “Let us go over to the other side,” and whatever He says will come to pass. Once the Lord speaks concerning a certain thing, it is settled. The Lord always fulfills His word. Hence, when He tells us to go over to the other side, we may be sure that we shall reach the other side, no matter what kind of storms may come. <span class="pg" data-page-id="162" id="162">[162]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Y58zRdwVwZdOug4OhuXYUyui5YTN0tMwYIpE2xtAxeB5rWIwx_UI_h1Cxbmt9gLsn">Resting with the Lord</h2><p data-content-id="EnWCv_eiedBm6acXbQgA3hI36_MxGVx9OO_VMk3ydCyoMCmwj4AjjstBnWwxvP728"> We need to believe in the Lord and not look at our environment or circumstances. Instead of looking at the storm, let us look at the resting Lord. Which will you follow—the storm or the resting Lord? We may even want to say to the Lord, “Lord, since You are resting, I shall rest with You. Let the wind blow. Because You are resting, I can rest with You.” However, it is easy to say this, but it is difficult to practice it. As one who has been practicing for more than fifty years to look at the Lord and not at circumstances, I must confess that I am still learning this lesson. </p>
<p data-content-id="DoAIPBJjBHkq_0FWa7TCjdOpXz6H4o4mOlsgbBKk_d-ko1FGk9fqp5bptFLQcr1Cs"> Often in our journey with the Lord we shall encounter a storm or a whirlwind. Then we may become distracted and forget the Lord’s word and the fact that He is with us and is at rest. Are you able to say, “Lord, since You are resting, I shall rest also”? Let us all learn to practice this. </p>
<p data-content-id="SlZ9LfzTj9oNzJ6-sZS1L42-FtUqhJ-Hu1E2vmyVDkctfWDUrJm1vTh_wbOlz4rGj"> Luke’s account in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68960" data-verses="Luke 8:22-25">8:22-25</span> does not show a dispensational change; neither does it present the authority of the kingdom of God. Here Luke portrays the Christian journey. According to the portrait in Luke, while we are taking the way ordained by the Lord, the Lord will be at rest, and the enemy will be busy. The evil spirits and the demons will be active to cause storms to frustrate us on our journey. We need to remember that actually this is not our journey; it is the Lord’s journey, and we are journeying with Him. We are taking His way, and He is on the way with us. In fact, He is even in the boat with us. We may say that the boat here signifies the church. For the Lord to be with us in the boat means that He is with us in the church. Although the “boat” of the church may be in the midst of a whirlwind and raging waters, we should not be troubled. Instead of being troubled, we should have peace in the resting Lord. </p>

Now we need to see that their being perfected was for the spreading of the jubilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="EnWCv_eiedBm6acXYSwA8z436_MxGVx9OO_VMk3ydCyoMCmwj4AjjstBnWwxvP728"> After the Man-Savior was fully prepared, He was baptized, tested, and anointed. Being fully qualified and perfected, He began His ministry. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68980" data-verses="Luke 4:1">chapter four</span>, His ministry opened with the proclamation of the jubilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="AUNZZyVVAVOomKProQGiXVO12JhGBpIJR1Zd6ilPf-0XAUbPCWwsUR_yeQ_zGl6pN"> When the Lord proclaimed the jubilee, He alone was carrying out the God-given ministry. After He made the proclamation concerning the jubilee, He called certain ones to Himself. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68981" data-verses="Luke 6:13">6:13</span> we see that He called His disciples, and “He chose from them twelve, whom He also named apostles.” We may say that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68982" data-verses="Luke 6:1">chapters six through eight</span> the twelve apostles were “apprentices” following the Lord to learn how to carry out His ministry. As indicated by the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68983" data-verses="Luke 7:36">7:36—8:56</span>, their sins were forgiven and they began to love the Lord and live a life of peace. They also began to grow in <span class="pg" data-page-id="168" id="168">[168]</span> life, shine as lamps, and become the relatives of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68984" data-verses="Luke 8:1">chapter eight</span> they journeyed with the Lord at His word. In one place they encountered demons and saw how the Lord cleared up the business of hog raising. Elsewhere, they encountered a woman with a life-leaking condition and a girl who was raised from the dead. Therefore, at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68985" data-verses="Luke 8:56">chapter eight</span> these followers of the Lord had been perfected to a certain extent. </p>

What is the jubilee? The jubilee is actually the gospel of the New Testament. As we have seen, this gospel is the proclamation of the release of the captives and of the recovery of the lost birthright. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68987" data-verses="Luke 9:1">chapter nine</span> we have the start of the spreading of this jubilee. Prior to this time, the ministry was carried out only by the Lord Himself. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68988" data-verses="Luke 9:1">9:1</span> we have the spreading through twelve others. Therefore, beginning with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68989" data-verses="Luke 9:1">9:1</span> we see the spreading of the ministry, the spreading of the jubilee, through the twelve apostles. </p>

Certain of the cases in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68991" data-verses="Luke 9:1-26">9:1-26</span> are found also in Matthew and Mark. In Matthew these cases are used as evidence to prove the doctrine of the kingdom of the heavens, and in Mark they are used to present the Lord Jesus as the faithful Slave of God carrying out God’s ordained ministry. In Luke, however, these cases are used to point out the spreading of the jubilee. The jubilee had already been proclaimed by the Man-Savior, and this proclamation continued until the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68992" data-verses="Luke 8:56">chapter eight</span>. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68993" data-verses="Luke 9:1">Luke 9</span> the spreading of the jubilee begins. No longer is there just one person proclaiming the jubilee. Now twelve others are sent out to spread the jubilee. Of course, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="68994" data-verses="Luke 9:1-26">9:1-26</span> the words “jubilee” or “acceptable year of the Lord” are not mentioned. Nevertheless, the underlying thought is very much related to the matter of jubilee. </p>

Therefore, the Man-Savior gave the twelve power and authority over demons and diseases. This is the negative aspect of the jubilee, the aspect of the release of the captives. </p>

The kingdom of God is the Savior (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69006" data-verses="Luke 17:21">17:21</span>) as the seed of life, sown into His believers, God’s chosen people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69007" data-verses="Mark 4:3">Mark 4:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69008" data-verses="Mark 4:26">26</span>), and developing into a realm which God may rule as His kingdom in His divine life. Its entrance is regeneration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69009" data-verses="John 3:5">John 3:5</span>), and its development is the believers’ growth in the divine life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69010" data-verses="2Peter 1:3-11">2 Pet. 1:3-11</span>). It is the church life today, in which the faithful believers live (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69011" data-verses="Romans 14:17">Rom. 14:17</span>), and it will develop into the coming kingdom as an inheritance reward (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69012" data-verses="Galatians 5:21">Gal. 5:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69013" data-verses="Ephesians 5:5">Eph. 5:5</span>) to the overcoming saints in the millennium (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69014" data-verses="Revelation 20:4">Rev. 20:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69015" data-verses="Revelation 20:6">6</span>). Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God, an eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God’s eternal life for all God’s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69016" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-4">Rev. 21:1-4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69017" data-verses="Revelation 22:1-5">22:1-5</span>). Such a kingdom, the kingdom of God, is what the Savior preached as the gospel, the good news (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69018" data-verses="Luke 4:43">4:43</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="HjWwmoGOlsak0TUDRDi_vcFVb6Y9pPEtBKlHqojq6TpIxbKDnyfW41Pa33wfqt__Y"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69019" data-verses="Luke 9:2">9:2</span>, the Lord sent out the twelve to proclaim the kingdom of God. To proclaim the kingdom of God is to proclaim the jubilee. In particular, it is to proclaim the positive aspect of the jubilee—the recovery of our lost right to the enjoyment of God. Therefore, in sending out the twelve, the Man-Savior was spreading the jubilee through them to the surrounding country. </p>

And into whatever house you enter, remain there, and from there go out.” Why did the Man-Savior tell the sent ones not to take anything for their journey? The reason He told them to take nothing was that in the jubilee things are common under God’s ordination. Therefore, there was no need for the twelve to take anything for themselves. The picture here indicates that when the jubilee comes there will not be any selfishness. Instead, everything will be both for us and for others. <span class="pg" data-page-id="171" id="171">[171]</span> </p>

After making that proclamation, He called certain ones to be His disciples, and of these He chose twelve to be His apostles. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69042" data-verses="Luke 9:1-6">9:1-6</span> the Lord sent out the twelve to spread the jubilee. In this portion of the Gospel of Luke we have the spreading of the Man-Savior’s ministry through the twelve apostles. </p>
<p data-content-id="UwoI3MPYw_sWGgTUdTo7cilGshtzOQ5LUvhTMmv7LdK1FIytONjnEzyH0ZWFVMBnz"> The apostles went out to proclaim the kingdom of God.

The feeding of the five thousand in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69043" data-verses="Luke 9:10-17">9:10-17</span> is also related to the jubilee. Luke’s account here indicates that in the jubilee there is no lack, no shortage. In the jubilee everyone is satisfied. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mixvss-j9tzRFTxypfp8OIhNaqOl6bARPohV1ILcl2Rfd6ZbvrtmR-ZjJ-Sa8BhLR"> We need to be impressed with the fact that Luke wrote his Gospel from the viewpoint of the jubilee. The ministry of the Man-Savior began in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69044" data-verses="Luke 4:1">chapter four</span> with the proclamation of the jubilee. We need to keep this in mind as we read the following chapters of Luke. However, when many readers of this Gospel come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69045" data-verses="Luke 9:1">chapter nine</span>, they may forget about the jubilee that was announced in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69046" data-verses="Luke 4:1">chapter four</span>. We should not make this mistake, but should keep the jubilee in mind as <span class="pg" data-page-id="176" id="176">[176]</span> we read through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69047" data-verses="Luke 5:1">chapters five through twenty-four</span>. The concept of the jubilee announced in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69048" data-verses="Luke 4:1">chapter four</span> governs all the following chapters. Therefore, we should regard what is recorded in these chapters as part of the jubilee declared in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69049" data-verses="Luke 4:1">Luke 4</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="Gn7ewN6nSdByHJgqlTngXVUOe-1UTJncAcUqo6emH0AAxLxRlyu8isObL6a-GDD-q"> If we have this view as we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69050" data-verses="Luke 9:10-17">9:10-17</span>, we shall want to see how the Man-Savior handles the situation with the hungry multitude. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69051" data-verses="Luke 9:13">verse 13</span> we see that “there were about five thousand men.” If the women and children are counted, the number must have exceeded ten thousand. Suppose the Lord had dismissed the crowd without feeding them, allowing them to remain hungry. In that case there would not have been the jubilee. Some might have complained and said, “I have been here all day long, and now I am hungry. Why have we been dismissed? Where shall we go, and how shall we find food?” If this had taken place, there would have been famine instead of jubilee. But as a result of the Lord’s feeding the crowd, there was a real application of the jubilee. Everyone was satisfied, and there was an abundance of food left over. </p>
<p data-content-id="crbZLnwlQe1t-R2NOGUjvKAIu5vZMDiBZWVp3fX5a8i7iFrksEzKqpk9CFqNeA0KZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69052" data-verses="Luke 9:12">9:12</span> the apostles said to the Lord, “Send the crowd away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms to lodge and find provisions.” But the Lord said to them, “You give them something to eat” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69053" data-verses="Luke 9:13">v. 13</span>). The disciples asked the Lord to send the crowds away so that they could obtain food for themselves, but the Lord told the disciples to give the crowd something to eat. Their concept was to ask people to do something; this is the principle of the law. But the Lord’s concept is to give people something to enjoy; this is the principle of grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y58zRdwVwZdOug4OisXYXyOi5YTN0tMwYIpE2xtAxeB5rWIwx_UI_h1Cxbmt9gLsn"> When the Lord told the twelve that they should give the crowd something to eat, they replied, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish among us” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69054" data-verses="Luke 9:13">v. 13</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69055" data-verses="John 6:9">John 6:9</span> tells us that these five loaves are barley loaves. In figure, barley typifies the resurrected Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69056" data-verses="Leviticus 23:10">Lev. 23:10</span>). Thus, the barley loaves signify Christ in resurrection as food to us. While the loaves are of the vegetable life, signifying the generating aspect of Christ’s life, the fish are of the animal life, <span class="pg" data-page-id="177" id="177">[177]</span> signifying the redeeming aspect of Christ’s life. To satisfy our spiritual hunger, we need Christ’s generating life as well as His redeeming life. Both aspects of His life are symbolized by small items—loaves and fishes. This indicates that the Man-Savior has come to be small pieces of food to feed His followers. </p>
<p data-content-id="EnWCv_eiedBm6acXYSgA0ho36_MxGVx9OO_VMk3ydCyoMCmwj4AjjstBnWwxvP728"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69057" data-verses="Luke 9:16">Luke 9:16</span> says, “And taking the five loaves and the two fish, looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.” The loaves were from the disciples, and they brought them to the Lord. After being blessed and broken by the Lord, they were given back to the disciples for distribution to the crowd, to whom the loaves became a great satisfaction. This indicates that the disciples were not the source of blessing; they were only the channels used by the Lord, who is the source of people’s satisfaction. </p>

Furthermore, the twelve baskets of broken pieces indicate that the resurrected Christ is unlimited and inexhaustible, and also that the Lord’s provision for us is abundant, more than sufficient to meet all our need. </p>
<p data-content-id="SlZ9LfzTj9oNzJ6-vbS1I5W-FtUqhJ-Hu1E2vmyVDkctfWDUrJm1vTh_wbOlz4rGj"> The ministry of the Man-Savior was a ministry of jubilee. Through the twelve He had begun to spread this ministry of jubilee. In the jubilee no one is poor; instead, everyone is filled and satisfied. In the jubilee there are no captives; on the contrary, all captives are released and brought back to the enjoyment of God. In the application of the jubilee in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69062" data-verses="Luke 9:12-17">9:12-17</span>, the people might have been beside themselves with joy. Some of the disciples might have said, “This is the jubilee proclaimed by the Lord. Now no one is poor, but everyone is satisfied.

This portion of the Gospel of Luke also is related to the jubilee. Here we see that it was necessary for the Lord Jesus to be transfigured. According to the entire revelation of the New Testament, we need transfiguration in order to enjoy the jubilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="RZzGEogxd1MGIsl2aZ5kgkiHSdLcm5J3IdyqcTX_a5S28-G-Yz8OH2qUTV12ioiQD"> The Greek word rendered “transfigured” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69093" data-verses="Matthew 17:2">Matthew 17:2</span> is the same as that translated “transformed” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69094" data-verses="Mark 9:2">Mark 9:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69095" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69096" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Romans 12:2</span>. The same Greek word is used also in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69097" data-verses="Philippians 3:21">Philippians 3:21</span>.

<p data-content-id="sd53dK7V3RACxeAhfZJaja_JWY7CXd4lKCZrOk5KHHUk8v9DyXsEuqfotQsdDEpDq"> The Man-Savior in the flesh needed transfiguration because He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, the likeness of the flesh of fallen man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69098" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Rom. 8:3</span>). Just as the brass serpent on the pole had the form of a serpent but not the poisonous nature of a serpent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69099" data-verses="Numbers 21:8-9">Num. 21:8-9</span>), so the Lord Jesus in the flesh had the likeness of the flesh of sin but not the nature of the flesh of sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69100" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span>). When He became flesh, He took on the form of the old man. Man had already become fallen when the Lord Jesus became flesh.

In Paul’s words in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69103" data-verses="1Timothy 3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>, this was a matter of God manifested in the flesh.

However, this is not yet the time of the full application of the jubilee. The full application of the jubilee involves transfiguration. Do you know when the Savior was transfigured in full? He was fully transfigured in His resurrection. The transfiguration on the mountain was on a small scale. But when the Lord was resurrected from among the dead, He was fully transfigured. He now remains in this state of transfiguration. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69104" data-verses="Philippians 3:21">Philippians 3:21</span>, when He comes back, we all shall be transfigured. </p>
<p data-content-id="f5f0VDzn9jkRQSn1NyFf8aRwlK3eq6Siv45D3Z1PVOSaG41wTyIuG2c1MeKQAjvFj"> Presently our transformation, or transfiguration, is taking place in our soul. Our spirit has been regenerated, and our soul is being transformed. A matured believer is one who has been fully transformed in his soul, that is, transformed in his mind, will, and emotion. Such a believer only needs his physical body to be transfigured at the coming of the transfigured Savior. This transfiguration of the body is called the redemption of the body by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69105" data-verses="Romans 8:23">Romans 8:23</span>. The redemption of the body is also the entering into the liberty of the glory of the children of God. Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69106" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> indicates that although we are in the jubilee today, we are not yet in the jubilee in a full way. When our body has been fully redeemed, fully transfigured and transformed, then we shall be brought into the freedom of the glory of the children of God, and that will be the jubilee in full. </p>

Even though we are in the year of jubilee, the acceptable year of the Lord, which is actually the entire New Testament age, if we <span class="pg" data-page-id="187" id="187">[187]</span> remain in the old creation we have nothing to do with participating in the enjoyment of the jubilee. This is the reason the situation among Christians today is pitiful. Many believers know only that their sins have been forgiven, but they do not know that their spirit has been regenerated. However, a forgiven person who does not know that he has been regenerated still remains in the old creation and cannot participate in the enjoyment of the jubilee. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IOMRlFycrPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW">TRANSFORMATION FOR<br/>THE ENJOYMENT OF THE JUBILEE</h2><p data-content-id="kAQNthUaZvalgvsKFvzCdAMJbCrdyQWj0UWwMbQUlst1TdatH57vU3-PT1x1LNEeo"> In order that we may enjoy the jubilee, our spirit has been regenerated. God has regenerated our spirit as the beginning of our participation in the enjoyment of the jubilee. This means that we began to enter into the enjoyment of the jubilee when our spirit was regenerated. When we called on the name of the Lord for salvation and experienced the forgiveness of sins, our spirit was regenerated. Even though we did not have the knowledge of what had taken place, within us there was rejoicing. The joy within us was a sign of the beginning of our participation in the enjoyment of the jubilee. A proper conversion and experience of salvation always bring in such an enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jgkr79uXp4nHSqPJwH4f2N8wm7qGnaecC8bfNtJTx_m3Ubj0zJ3n8sOq8U2GgJfUN"> Many believers, after being regenerated, have been misled into caring for doctrine merely in a mental way. As a result, they have lost their enjoyment of the jubilee. However, we in the Lord’s recovery have been brought back from theology and from mere doctrinal, mental understanding to our regenerated spirit. The more the Lord spreads from our spirit into our soul, saturating our mind, will, and emotion, the more we participate in the enjoyment of the jubilee. As we experience <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69107" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69108" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Romans 12:2</span>, that is, as we are being transformed in our soul, we enjoy the jubilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="zYdoNmJ8sJ3EfPJeAnXNjq7Y9_7RUWZfgnhUmVfdTB_5mEQTlpUx_z2KThQMh-S0-"> Have you seen what the jubilee is? The jubilee is a release from bondage and the entering into the enjoyment of the Triune God. We began to experience this jubilee when we were regenerated. Through regeneration we were released from bondage and entered into the enjoyment of the Triune <span class="pg" data-page-id="188" id="188">[188]</span> God. But soon after we were regenerated, many of us were misled by blind teachers, and we lost the enjoyment of the jubilee. Now in the Lord’s recovery we have come back to our regenerated spirit, and we have begun to experience transformation in our soul. </p>
<p data-content-id="aJBHB16Du0i39s63s9L45l_cHmEpg--JpExe5woWN23707a7BR6E28G078JPrLzJy"> According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69109" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>, we are being transformed into the same image, the image of the Lord, from one degree of glory to another. As we go on from one degree of glory to another degree, we are excited because as we progress we participate more in the release from bondage and enter more fully into the enjoyment of the Triune God. This is transformation for the enjoyment of the jubilee. This transformation is depicted by the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus on Mount Hermon. </p>
<p data-content-id="baXaoDjM31g4vdogIOI_AmJsY6kl2rRDOpin976WeiNY5gEGyluhr_T3XIAmn92Sv"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69110" data-verses="Luke 9:23-24">9:23 and 24</span> the Lord says, “If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his soul life will lose it, but whoever loses his soul life for My sake, this one shall save it.” To bear our cross to follow the Lord and to deny our soul life is to identify ourselves with His death. The Lord’s death crosses off the natural life and the old creation so that we may enter into the new creation, into a transfigured condition. Here, in a transfigured state, we participate in the enjoyment of the jubilee. Hence, for the enjoyment of the jubilee there is the need of transfiguration. </p>

This was fulfilled by the Lord’s transfiguration on the mountain. This means that His transfiguration was the coming of the kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="8rK9hZU17CqFQv_7Y-cMdUjV076l38frJWrb3fYskUnsCbvB8WxSNVgXi8Bko75qT"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69112" data-verses="Luke 9:28-29">Luke 9:28 and 29</span> say, “And about eight days after these words, it came about that He took with Him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray. And it came about that as He prayed the appearance of His <span class="pg" data-page-id="189" id="189">[189]</span> face became different, and His garment dazzling white.” Literally, the Greek words rendered “dazzling white” mean flashing like lightning. Unlike <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69113" data-verses="Matthew 17:1">Matthew 17</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69114" data-verses="Mark 9:1">Mark 9</span>, these verses do not use the word “transfigured.” Nevertheless, in these verses we certainly can see the Lord’s transfiguration. His transfiguration was the coming, the appearing, of the kingdom of God. </p>

The first section was accomplished in Galilee (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69140" data-verses="Luke 4:14">4:14—9:50</span>). This section concludes with the Lord’s unveiling His death the second time and with a word that exposes the naturalness of His disciples. The second section of the Man-Savior’s ministry takes place on the way from Galilee to Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69141" data-verses="Luke 9:51">9:51—19:27</span>). The first section of His ministry covered twenty-six matters. As we shall see, thirty-seven matters are covered in the second section. The first matter in this section is the Man-Savior’s being rejected by the Samaritans (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69142" data-verses="Luke 9:51-56">9:51-56</span>). </p>

As the Lamb of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69144" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>), it was necessary for the Lord to be offered to God at Mount Moriah, which is Mount Zion, where Abraham offered Isaac and enjoyed God’s provision of a ram as a substitute for his son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69145" data-verses="Genesis 22:2">Gen. 22:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69146" data-verses="Genesis 22:9-14">9-14</span>) and where the temple was built in Jerusalem <span class="pg" data-page-id="196" id="196">[196]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69147" data-verses="2Chronicles 3:1">2 Chron. 3:1</span>).

It should also be there that He would be crucified according to the Roman style of punishment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69152" data-verses="John 18:31-32">John 18:31-32</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69153" data-verses="John 19:6">19:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69154" data-verses="John 19:14-15">14-15</span>) to fulfill the type concerning the kind of death He would die (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69155" data-verses="Numbers 21:8-9">Num. 21:8-9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69156" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span>).

And having gone, they entered into a village of the Samaritans to prepare for Him. And they did not receive Him, because He was going with His face toward Jerusalem.” Here we see that the Man-Savior was rejected by the Samaritans. </p>
<p data-content-id="5xKEgdpuEwfEMeypNVJXxSKMqK2Fa2tvJZgq5hBR6INjxpLJ7ifzk23cJPGz7OALQ"> There was no way the Lord Jesus could go from Galilee to Jerusalem without passing through Samaria. The Samaritans were part Gentile and part Jewish. The Jews absolutely rejected them and refused to consider them part of the holy people. The Samaritans were offended by this and did not think well regarding the Jews. Realizing the situation, the Lord knew that it was difficult for Him and those with Him to pass through Samaria. More than seventy others were journeying with Him. This is proved by the fact that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69172" data-verses="Luke 10:1">10:1</span> He “appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two before His face into every city and place where He Himself was about to come” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69173" data-verses="Luke 10:1">10:1</span>). </p>

These messengers entered into a village of the Samaritans to prepare for the Lord. However, the Samaritans would not receive Him. Because the Lord was rejected by the Samaritans, there was no way for Him and His followers to stay in that village. It was necessary for them to go to some other village. </p>
<p data-content-id="hR1Jkh6fGpavWnsBSzKfAkaA95DtKL_27Gp4pGUAt4ZXghu0FgoVfq59grebM748A"> Seeing that the Samaritans had rejected the Man-Savior, “the disciples, James and John, said, Lord, do You want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69175" data-verses="Luke 9:54">v. 54</span>). Some manuscripts add to this verse the words “as also Elijah did.” The Lord turned to these disciples and rebuked them. It seems that the Lord might have been telling them, “Don’t you know that we are proclaiming the jubilee? The jubilee is not a matter of calling down fire to consume people. Instead of telling fire to come down from heaven, we are bringing peace to others.” </p>

This name was added to James and John because of their impetuosity. Their impetuous word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69177" data-verses="Luke 9:54">Luke 9:54</span> was contrary to the virtue and morality of the Savior whom they accompanied. </p>

He saw crowds being attracted to the Savior (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69187" data-verses="Matthew 8:18">Matt. 8:18</span>) and wanted to follow Him out of curiosity, without counting the cost. This was the reason the Man-Savior answered him in such a way as to cause him to consider the cost. The Savior cautioned him by pointing out that, although crowds were attracted to Him He had nowhere to rest. This indicates that it would cost considerable suffering to the one in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69188" data-verses="Luke 9:57">verse 57</span> to follow the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="jXdlQ8xxZMxS77oeC-cs02vSEOMlQ9s1jH8YQMk7cEhKguIbR9jLLFm6wFfxpAM7f"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69189" data-verses="Luke 9:58">9:58</span> the Lord pointed out specifically that He had nowhere to lay His head. Here we see that the Savior’s human life was a life of suffering. At His birth there was no room in the inn for Him to lie down (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69190" data-verses="Luke 2:7">2:7</span>). In His marvelous ministry there was likewise no place for Him to rest. Suffering, therefore, is a sign of His human life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69191" data-verses="Luke 2:12">2:12</span>). </p>

To be sure, the scribe in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69193" data-verses="Luke 9:57">verse 57</span> did not know what it would cost him to follow the Lord. Hence the Savior warned this one that following Him would cost him much suffering. </p>

But he said, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.” This one was called by the Savior to follow Him, but he considered his duty to his dead father and would not follow Him immediately. Hence, the Savior encouraged him to pay the price that he might become a follower in His great commission to publish the kingdom of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69195" data-verses="Luke 9:60">v. 60</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="HjWwmoGOlsak0TUDRCi_rOFVb6Y9pPEtBKlHqojq6TpIxbKDnyfW41Pa33wfqt__Y"> In the foregoing message we began to consider the second section of the earthly ministry of the Man-Savior, the section from Galilee to Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69223" data-verses="Luke 9:51">9:51—19:27</span>). We have seen that the Lord was rejected by the Samaritans (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69224" data-verses="Luke 9:51-56">9:51-56</span>). After this rejection, He instructed certain ones how to follow Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69225" data-verses="Luke 9:57-62">9:57-62</span>). This instruction was a preparation for the appointing of seventy disciples to spread His ministry, as recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69226" data-verses="Luke 10:1-24">10:1-24</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IOMQFF0PbPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW">THE SEVENTY RETURNING WITH JOY</h2><p data-content-id="kAQNthUaZvalgvsKFuTCUTMJbCrdyQWj0UWwMbQUlst1TdatH57vU3-PT1x1LNEeo"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69227" data-verses="Luke 10:17">Luke 10:17</span> says, “And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name.” The Lord Jesus replied, “I was beholding Satan when he fell like lightning out of heaven.” At the time of his rebellion against God before the creation of man, Satan was judged and sentenced to be cast into Sheol (Hades), to the recesses, the deepest part of the pit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69228" data-verses="Isaiah 14:15">Isa. 14:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69229" data-verses="Ezekiel 28:17">Ezek. 28:17</span>). Then God began to execute His sentence on him on different occasions in different degrees, such as through the seventy disciples in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69230" data-verses="Luke 10:1">Luke 10</span>, through Christ on the cross (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69231" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Heb. 2:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69232" data-verses="John 12:31">John 12:31</span>), through the manchild and Michael before the great tribulation when he was cast down to the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69233" data-verses="Revelation 12:5">Rev. 12:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69234" data-verses="Revelation 12:7-10">7-10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69235" data-verses="Revelation 12:13">13</span>), and through the angel before the millennium when he was cast into the abyss, the bottomless pit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69236" data-verses="Revelation 20:1-2">Rev. 20:1-2</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="204" id="204">[204]</span>), until finally he will be cast into the lake of fire after the millennium (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69237" data-verses="Revelation 20:10">Rev. 20:10</span>) for eternity. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jgkr79uXp4nHSqPJwGYf-eswm7qGnaecC8bfNtJTx_m3Ubj0zJ3n8sOq8U2GgJfUN"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69238" data-verses="Luke 10:19">10:19</span> the Lord went on to say to the seventy, “Behold, I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall by any means hurt you.” What the Lord gave to the disciples was authority; what the enemy had was power. Authority subdues power. The serpents in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69239" data-verses="Luke 10:19">verse 19</span> may signify Satan and his angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69240" data-verses="Ephesians 2:2">Eph. 2:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69241" data-verses="Ephesians 6:11-12">6:11-12</span>); the scorpions may signify demons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69242" data-verses="Luke 10:17">Luke 10:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69243" data-verses="Luke 10:20">20</span>). The disciples subdued the evil power by the authority of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="zYdoNmJ8sJ3EfPJeAm3Njo7Y9_7RUWZfgnhUmVfdTB_5mEQTlpUx_z2KThQMh-S0-"> After telling the disciples that He was beholding Satan when he fell like lightning out of heaven and after saying that He had given them authority over all the power of the enemy, the Lord said, “However, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are inscribed in the heavens” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69244" data-verses="Luke 10:20">v. 20</span>). Certainly being saved, having our names inscribed in the heavens, is more crucial than casting out demons. Nevertheless, it is easy for believers, especially young ones, to be more excited about the casting out of demons than about having their names inscribed in the heavens. After listening to the report of the seventy, the Lord Jesus was not excited about the subduing of the demons. The Lord told the disciples that they should rejoice, exult, not that the spirits are subject to them, but that their names have been inscribed in the heavens. </p>
<p data-content-id="aJBHB16Du0i39s63s8r45n_cHmEpg--JpExe5woWN23707a7BR6E28G078JPrLzJy"> When we first hear about the jubilee, we may be very excited. I noticed that after a recent message on the jubilee the saints were extremely excited. But they were not excited when I pointed out in a later message that we must be identified with Christ’s death in order to participate in the enjoyment of the jubilee. Christ had to die in order to accomplish the jubilee, and we need to die in order to participate in the jubilee. Apart from death, the jubilee cannot be our experience. We, however, do not find this kind of word very exciting. </p>
<p data-content-id="baXaoDjM31g4vdogIPo_DmpsY6kl2rRDOpin976WeiNY5gEGyluhr_T3XIAmn92Sv"> After the Lord Jesus made the matter of the jubilee clear to the disciples. He spoke to them concerning His death. He <span class="pg" data-page-id="205" id="205">[205]</span> unveiled His death the first time in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69245" data-verses="Luke 9:22">Luke 9:22</span>, and the second time in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69246" data-verses="Luke 9:44">9:44</span>. Before unveiling His death the second time, the Lord told the disciples to “put these words” into their ears. Nevertheless, they did not understand what He was talking about. Like those disciples, we may be excited about the jubilee, but not about the Lord’s word concerning our need to die with Him in order to participate in the enjoyment of the jubilee. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69247" data-verses="Luke 10:20">10:20</span> the Lord told the disciples not to rejoice over the subduing of the demons, over the fact that the spirits are subject to them. He told them to rejoice instead that their names are inscribed in the heavens. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qMcyXCf9JxgO6C4J-WfI29OtWR45eDmy97SasR1HjYltLhBmhnwtFer_oxArsFU1X">THE MAN-SAVIOR EXULTING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="y695EWmpNHnEWPC-sqz1C02J3jSUoQBFyaZAx96FqVB_sFX0OYnWKsHhj6JUg1n-e"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69248" data-verses="Luke 10:21-22">Luke 10:21 and 22</span> say, “In the same hour He exulted in the Holy Spirit and said, I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in Your sight. All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.” The Lord’s prayer here involves the Trinity economically. In the Holy Spirit the Son praised the Father, the Lord of heaven and earth. Economically, all things have been delivered to the Son by the Father. Now no one knows who the Son is except the Father and who the Father is except the Son, and he to whom the Son wills to reveal the Father. The emphasis here is not on the essential Trinity but on the economical Trinity. </p>
<p data-content-id="8rK9hZU17CqFQv_7Y_8MeVDV076l38frJWrb3fYskUnsCbvB8WxSNVgXi8Bko75qT"> In His exulting in the Holy Spirit, the Savior praised the Father, the Lord of heaven and earth. “Father” refers to the Father’s relationship with Him, the Son. “Lord of heaven and earth” refers to God’s relationship with the universe. When God’s people were defeated by His enemy, He was called the God of heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69249" data-verses="Ezra 5:11-12">Ezra 5:11-12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69250" data-verses="Daniel 2:18">Dan. 2:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69251" data-verses="Daniel 2:37">37</span>). But when there was a man standing for God on the earth, He was called the possessor of heaven and earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69252" data-verses="Genesis 14:19">Gen. 14:19</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69253" data-verses="Genesis 14:22">22</span>). Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69254" data-verses="Luke 10:21">Luke 10:21</span> the Man-Savior, as the Son of Man, <span class="pg" data-page-id="206" id="206">[206]</span> also called the Father the Lord of heaven and earth. This indicates that He was standing on the earth for God’s interest. </p>
<p data-content-id="0yMFLpTNFijhdJXKbB9sRUr0HDyobmW8BsYvNv_3Cioz9unzd69fVMg-p6C0n6Ifp"> The Son in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69255" data-verses="Luke 10:21">10:21</span> praised the Father that He has “hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to babes.” The “wise and intelligent” may refer in particular to the people of the three cities mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69256" data-verses="Luke 10:13">verses 13</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69257" data-verses="Luke 10:15">15</span>, people who were wise and intelligent in their own eyes. The Father’s will was to hide the knowledge of the Son and the Father from such people. The “babes” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69258" data-verses="Luke 10:21">verse 21</span> refer to the disciples, who were children of wisdom. The Father was pleased to reveal both the Son and the Father to them. </p>
<p data-content-id="7WKyJ1T_uHk5hAsLNQs1oL8FJj4I670thJCRuFLar2G9usySzvd5B-MQRqEDy9EDO"> We should not regard ourselves as wise and intelligent. If we have such a view of ourselves, we shall not receive the revelation of the Son and the Father. Instead of considering ourselves wise and intelligent, we should regard ourselves as babes, as those who are not knowledgeable. It is well-pleasing in the Father’s sight to reveal the knowledge of the Son and the Father to babes, but to hide it from the wise and intelligent. </p>
<p data-content-id="_ZwqsA5v5sK5Gd_CCtEVx8U-oyUvJZvrd4_dLBztnh2YyrGo-ZQKJ0rrkSkFZAXKk"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69259" data-verses="Luke 10:22">verse 22</span> the Lord says that no one knows who the Son is except the Father and who the Father is except the Son, and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him. The word “knows” here denotes full knowledge, not mere objective acquaintance. Concerning the Son, only the Father has such knowledge, and concerning the Father, only the Son has such knowledge. Hence, to know the Son requires the Father’s revelation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69260" data-verses="Matthew 16:17">Matt. 16:17</span>), and to know the Father requires the Son’s revelation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69261" data-verses="John 17:6">John 17:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69262" data-verses="John 17:26">26</span>). The word “wills” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69263" data-verses="Luke 10:22">10:22</span> means to deliberately exercise the will to counsel. </p>

It is significant that Luke put these two matters together. Apparently they are not related; actually, in our Christian experience, the Lord as the good Samaritan is related to His being received by Martha. In this message we shall consider the portrait of the Lord as the good Samaritan with the highest morality, and in the following message we shall consider His being received by Martha at Bethany. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7WKyJ1T_uHk5hAsLNQ81uYsFJj4I670thJCRuFLar2G9usySzvd5B-MQRqEDy9EDO">THE MAN-SAVIOR<br/>PORTRAYING HIMSELF AS A SAMARITAN</h2><p data-content-id="_ZwqsA5v5sK5Gd_CCtUV4s0-oyUvJZvrd4_dLBztnh2YyrGo-ZQKJ0rrkSkFZAXKk"> We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69283" data-verses="Luke 9:51-56">9:51-56</span> it was necessary for the Lord Jesus and His followers to pass through Samaria. The Samaritans, however, did not receive Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69284" data-verses="Luke 9:53">9:53</span>). Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69285" data-verses="Luke 10:25-37">10:25-37</span> the Lord portrays Himself as a Samaritan. </p>
<p data-content-id="B-xax8NKp7LCijI7VvQMuu5os3kSlmvYlicWUqjousBPGePPVlOH7nulgHhpJQvmR"> In the parable of the good Samaritan many things are covered. This parable refers to Judaism, the Old Testament, the law, the priests, the Levites, Christ, the Spirit, the divine life, the church, the way to bring people to the church, the blessing the Lord gives to the church, the Lord’s coming back, and the Lord’s reward to the church. <span class="pg" data-page-id="212" id="212">[212]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="10Y2CNEKWaUAkDvQ1l8a_1rffZ6_98e4N8ozCPPMzkmQPd2gHT1E_ldnAuur5g5vG"> Samaria was the leading region of the northern kingdom of Israel and the place where its capital was (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69286" data-verses="1Kings 16:24">1 Kings 16:24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69287" data-verses="1Kings 16:29">29</span>). Before 700 B.C. the Assyrians captured Samaria and brought people from Babylon and other heathen countries to the cities of Samaria (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69288" data-verses="2Kings 17:6">2 Kings 17:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69289" data-verses="2Kings 17:24">24</span>). From that time, the Samaritans became people of mixed blood—heathen with Jew. History tells us that they had the Pentateuch (the five books of Moses) and worshipped God according to that part of the Old Testament. But they were never recognized by the Jews as part of the Jewish people. </p>

The Lord seems to be saying, “I am a Samaritan, one despised by you.” </p>

Such a lawyer was a scribe among the Pharisees. This lawyer, one very knowledgeable in the law, was also proud. Being one who justified himself, he stood up to test the Man-Savior. </p>

<p data-content-id="6v5bqSZVkxM1HMGlSOxeNom8O5Ww8o25b4qVQMP5MlzkvkTR8-sJeZYdiAzVYImAy"> To inherit eternal life is also “to enter into life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69294" data-verses="Matthew 19:17">Matt. 19:17</span>). To enter into life is to enter into the kingdom of the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69295" data-verses="Matthew 19:23">Matt. 19:23</span>). The kingdom of the heavens is a realm of God’s eternal life. Hence, when we enter into it, we enter into God’s life. This differs from being saved. To be saved is to have God’s life enter into us, whereas to enter into the kingdom of the heavens is to enter into God’s life. The former is to be redeemed and regenerated with God’s life; the latter is to live and walk by God’s life. The one is a matter of birth; the other is a matter of living. <span class="pg" data-page-id="213" id="213">[213]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="RZzGEogxd1MGIsl2aYJkp3iHSdLcm5J3IdyqcTX_a5S28-G-Yz8OH2qUTV12ioiQD"> According to the New Testament, to receive eternal life is one thing, and to inherit eternal life is another thing. To receive eternal life is for our salvation in this age, but to inherit eternal life is a reward in the coming age, that is, in the coming kingdom. It is important, therefore, that we differentiate these matters concerning our experience of eternal life. Now, in this present age, we may receive eternal life and experience it. This is a matter of salvation. But inheriting eternal life will be a blessing given to us as a reward in the coming age of the kingdom. Thus, inheriting eternal life is not a matter of salvation; instead, it is a matter related to the kingdom reward. </p>
<p data-content-id="sd53dK7V3RACxeAhfY5arJvJWY7CXd4lKCZrOk5KHHUk8v9DyXsEuqfotQsdDEpDq"> When the scribe asked the Man-Savior about what he should do to inherit eternal life, the Lord said to him, “What is written in the law? How do you read it?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69296" data-verses="Luke 10:26">v. 26</span>). The lawyer answered, “You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole strength, and with your whole mind, and your neighbor as yourself” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69297" data-verses="Luke 10:27">v. 27</span>).

As a display of his pride, he asked the Lord who his neighbor was. He seemed to be telling the Lord, “Who is my neighbor that I may love him?” In the parable that follows, the Lord answered the lawyer by showing him that he did not need a neighbor to love. Instead, he needed a neighbor to love him. Because he is not able to love, he needs someone to love him. As we shall see, this neighbor is the good Samaritan. </p>
<p data-content-id="mFzvXUhbhqpISr0cdDtgtiF1AZG80kf7bH6haSXLEJRmHfrjBcKo82-9Gg2bAZ_94"> The parable of the Samaritan is one of the unique parables narrated only by Luke. This parable conveys the principle of high morality in the Savior’s full salvation. The “certain man” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69302" data-verses="Luke 10:30">verse 30</span>, in the Savior’s intention, signified <span class="pg" data-page-id="214" id="214">[214]</span> the self-justified lawyer as a sinner fallen from the foundation of peace (Jerusalem) to the condition of curse (Jericho). </p>

The words “going down” indicate falling from the city of the foundation of peace to the city of curse. Therefore, the certain man in this parable was falling from the foundation of peace to a place of curse. The way he was taking was the way of such a fall. </p>

These robbers signify the legalistic teachers of the Judaic law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69307" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10:1</span>), who used the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69308" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:56">1 Cor. 15:56</span>) to rob the lawkeepers like the self-justified lawyer. The word “stripped” signifies the stripping by the law misused by the Judaizers. The Greek word translated “beat” literally means “laid blows upon.” This beating signifies the killing by the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69309" data-verses="Romans 7:9-10">Rom. 7:9-10</span>). Furthermore, the robbers leaving the man half dead signifies the Judaizers’ leaving the lawkeeper in a dead condition (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69310" data-verses="Romans 7:11">Rom. 7:11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69311" data-verses="Romans 7:13">13</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="PIjOD0qFuTXceUSZsDGZAY8E0eeqSfaj3wRhOBw1FeXJDCmFaOPLe_ykOCcLaqUht"> All the Pharisees, legalistic teachers of Judaism, are here likened to robbers. The lawyer is likened to the one going down from Jerusalem to Jericho who fell among these robbers and was stripped and beaten by them. The legalistic teachers of the Jewish religion stripped people and beat them and then left them half dead. This was the situation of the lawyer, although he did not realize that he was in such a condition. </p>

What is the connection between these two cases? The connection is that after we have been saved through realizing the Savior’s compassion and love, we should serve Him. In other words, saved ones should be serving ones. In order to be saved we need to realize the Savior’s compassion and love. In order to serve Him, we need to know His desire and preference. We should not serve the Lord according to our opinion, concept, or understanding. Instead, we should serve Him according to His desire and preference. </p>
<p data-content-id="ov0pwXq8uOJOycOiH1qN3O2IpYzHGrTUx1Dbcc3jku5CrgeFN6HqgZR5btlLER604"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69333" data-verses="Luke 10:38-39">Luke 10:38 and 39</span> say, “Now as they were going, He entered into a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha received Him as a guest into her home. And she had a sister called Mary, who also was seated at the Lord’s feet and was listening to His word.” The village here is Bethany (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69334" data-verses="John 12:1">John 12:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69335" data-verses="Mark 11:1">Mark 11:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69336" data-verses="Matthew 21:17">Matt. 21:17</span>). The name Bethany means the house of affliction. </p>
<p data-content-id="37AX-gTuAtUIfnNeMXKhy1VkDbtYWR3LTu6iLVxczyu6wYZF7FopoaS4d9S_W-BJ4"> According to the record of the Gospels, in the Lord’s last visit to Jerusalem, He remained in the city only during the <span class="pg" data-page-id="220" id="220">[220]</span> day for His ministry. Every evening He departed to lodge in Bethany, on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69337" data-verses="Mark 11:19">Mark 11:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69338" data-verses="Luke 21:37">Luke 21:37</span>), where the house of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus and the house of Simon were (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69339" data-verses="John 11:1">John 11:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69340" data-verses="Matthew 26:6">Matt. 26:6</span>).

<p data-content-id="_ZwqsA5v5sK5Gd_CCtkVx-U-oyUvJZvrd4_dLBztnh2YyrGo-ZQKJ0rrkSkFZAXKk"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69341" data-verses="Luke 10:38-39">Luke 10:38 and 39</span> mention Martha and Mary. The name Martha probably comes from Chaldean and means “she was rebellious.” The Greek word Mary is Maria, for the Hebrew Miriam and means “their rebellion” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69342" data-verses="Numbers 12:1">Num. 12:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69343" data-verses="Numbers 12:10-15">10-15</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="B-xax8NKp7LCijI7VvgMm8Jos3kSlmvYlicWUqjousBPGePPVlOH7nulgHhpJQvmR"> The meaning of the names of Martha and Mary conveys the thought of rebellion. This may indicate their natural life. The Lord’s salvation can transform the rebellious into the submissive, as portrayed in this story. One like the rebellious Miriam in the Old Testament becomes one like the submissive Mary in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="xdxTxFZ3QLG06tmoWbgONKKoarNeZMRzYj39H4NLabyTJr4rWTMePzQvvgQ8LEOaY"> Mary was listening to the Lord’s word, but “Martha was distracted with much serving” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69344" data-verses="Luke 10:40">v. 40</span>). The Greek word translated “distracted” means to be drawn about in different directions. </p>
<p data-content-id="rR_dpE6vYaDaPaCKg0FuojNGNcFtz_3rupQBp4xmcb2zrtZinaTEqSTzFHUuwqBbj"> Standing over the Lord, Martha said, “Lord, does it not matter to You that my sister has left me to serve alone?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69345" data-verses="Luke 10:40">v. 40</span>). The Lord answered, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things; but one thing is necessary; for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.” Here we see that the Lord prefers His saved ones who love Him to listen to Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69346" data-verses="Luke 10:39">v. 39</span>) that they may know His desire, rather than do things for Him without knowing His will (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69347" data-verses="1Samuel 15:22">1 Sam. 15:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69348" data-verses="Ecclesiastes 5:1">Eccl. 5:1</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="dvWnnIN7e0JKw-7c7KnxsrFKvbCR3lHyth-Z-qR8i3gE62O3MzE72ycw46N8mvBgO"> It is quite significant that this story of Martha and Mary follows immediately after the parable of the good Samaritan. The first shows the compassion and love of the Savior, who is a Man as the sinner’s neighbor. The second unveils the desire and preference of the Lord, who is God as the believers’ Master. The Savior’s compassion and love are for our salvation by Him; the Lord’s desire and preference are for our service to Him. After receiving salvation from the <span class="pg" data-page-id="221" id="221">[221]</span> Savior, we should render service to the Lord. For our salvation we need to realize the Savior’s compassion and love; for our service we need to know the Lord’s desire and preference. </p>

However, Martha served the Savior according to her own concept and understanding. She thought that after making a long journey the Lord wanted to be served with material things. Therefore, she was busy in doing many things for the Man-Savior. </p>
<p data-content-id="lXx03sAZnH1566ErK9Qk_KGN6YjVqHNC8OyUynANn47kviFgaPXvRFBN-BRclOuC0"> Do you think that when the Lord came into Martha’s home in Bethany His desire was to be served with material things? To be sure, it was not His desire to be served with food. On the contrary, His desire was that His saved ones would listen to Him in order to know what was on His heart. The Lord did not care about eating; He wanted those who loved Him to be silent, to sit with Him, to listen to Him, and to concentrate on His speaking. In this way they would know His desire and preference. </p>
<p data-content-id="O6A_Zpet8NpkAD120y3VI_X96Jkgmribh2Ghh9n9QaeX9vJyetjJM0RwCL0BYvdJK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69349" data-verses="Luke 10:39">10:39</span> Mary sat at the Lord’s feet listening to His word. Later, she prepared ointment to anoint Him before His death. How did Mary know to do this? I believe she came to know this through listening to the Savior’s speaking. By sitting at the Savior’s feet and listening to His word, she came to know His desire and preference. </p>
<p data-content-id="454lFLK2tydPg5el9GGBbfHpHQtD5QB0eD81SP4uSuDpX_AQORq44Je3A02kXbzxC"> Today many are busy trying to get saved. They think that salvation depends on what they do. But there is no need for us to do anything to be saved. In order for a person to be saved, he needs to realize that he is incapable of saving himself, for he, like the man in the parable of the good Samaritan, is one who has been stripped, beaten, and left half dead. This indicates that we all need a Savior, One who is full of compassion and love. When we realize the Savior’s compassion and love, we shall enjoy His saving grace, which is full of human virtues and divine attributes. This is what it means to be saved. <span class="pg" data-page-id="222" id="222">[222]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="37AX-gTuAtUIfnNeMXKh5nlkDbtYWR3LTu6iLVxczyu6wYZF7FopoaS4d9S_W-BJ4"> Once we have been convinced by the Savior’s compassion and love and are saved, we may try to do many things for the Lord. We may think that now that we love Him we should be busy doing things for Him. I have never met a saved person who does not have the thought of doing things for the Lord. Every saved person I know has the concept of working for the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="Gn7ewN6nSdByHJgqlSXgUV0Oe-1UTJncAcUqo6emH0AAxLxRlyu8isObL6a-GDD-q"> In recent months certain ones told me that since the Lord is blessing His recovery, we should be busy doing various things. Some proposed that we set up schools, and others, that we establish hospitals. Others suggested that we be busy with different kinds of activities. When I heard these proposals, I said to myself, “I do not have any burden for these things. I am not burdened to set up schools or hospitals. When I hear such proposals, my desire is simply to rest with the Lord. I don’t believe the Lord wants us to be busy in this way.” </p>
<p data-content-id="crbZLnwlQe1t-R2NOHkjsKgIu5vZMDiBZWVp3fX5a8i7iFrksEzKqpk9CFqNeA0KZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69350" data-verses="Luke 10:38-42">10:38-42</span> Martha was very busy in many directions, and she was trying to make the Lord busy. She saw the situation involving the Lord and her sister, Mary. Mary was not doing anything. She was simply sitting at the Lord’s feet and listening to His word, and the Lord seemed to appreciate Mary’s silence. This bothered Martha and she even gave the Lord a command: “Tell her that she should do her part with me.” Here Martha seemed to be saying, “Lord, don’t You realize that I’m very busy? Why, then, don’t You tell my sister to do something to help me?” </p>

They may also be trying to make the Savior busy. But those who know the Lord and who know His desire and preference would say, “Don’t be so busy. The Lord wants to rest. The most precious thing to Him is not that you work for Him or try to do things for Him. What is most precious to Him is that you sit with Him and silently listen to His word. <span class="pg" data-page-id="223" id="223">[223]</span> If you sit with the Lord and listen to His word, you will know His desire and preference.” </p>

This characteristic is that Luke always shows us in the Man-Savior the mingling of the divine attributes with the human virtues to produce the highest standard of morality for the New Testament jubilee. Here we have three matters. First, in Luke’s composition the basic and intrinsic elements are the humanity and divinity of the Man-Savior. The Gospel of Luke is based upon the fact that the Lord has two essences—the divine essence and the human essence. Second, Luke’s Gospel presents the highest standard of morality, a morality that is the result of the mingling of the divine attributes with the human virtues. Third, this Gospel proclaims the New Testament jubilee. The proclamation of the jubilee is clearly made in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69356" data-verses="Luke 4:1">chapter four</span>. We need to keep these three matters in mind in reading the Gospel of Luke, for they will help us understand this Gospel. In the Gospel of Luke we have the divine essence mingled with the human essence and the divine attributes mingled with the human virtues to produce the highest standard of morality, and this is for the New Testament jubilee. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="5xKEgdpuEwfEMeypNUJX4AqMqK2Fa2tvJZgq5hBR6INjxpLJ7ifzk23cJPGz7OALQ">The Divine Essence Mingled with the Human Essence</h2><p data-content-id="NIP9vcQSpsaW9kg2wInrS--UIxlFrb3RZvwz6cWaDdxDBDLgKxxI62zDhQMwvPdhT"> We need to have a full realization of these basic and <span class="pg" data-page-id="228" id="228">[228]</span> intrinsic elements of Luke’s writing. By now we should have seen that in his Gospel, Luke reveals the Man-Savior as the One who is a composition of the divine essence mingled with the human essence. As such a One, He is the God-man because He is both the complete God and a perfect man. In Him we see God and man. In Him we have the complete God and a perfect man. This means that in Him we have a composition of the mingling of God with man. In this mingling, however, the Man-Savior loses neither the divine nature, the nature of God, nor the human nature, the nature of man. Rather, in the mingling these natures remain distinguishable, and there is no producing of a third nature. This is the first main point we should keep in mind for our understanding of Luke. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="whXJpCNVhaMbONnpKollLFbV78Gr88OYrW5ZYazISocRSVFEj93Rh6WuKCXo2tcws">The Highest Standard of Morality</h2><p data-content-id="Lj54LQasZ-K8EIg0N8ABimZk1nfFprp5qpL9M39N7uxjTamFkVxVWNhxhdjVx7yWi"> The Gospel of Luke also reveals that in the Man-Savior we have the mingling of the divine attributes with the human virtues to produce the highest standard of morality. Throughout this Gospel we see in the Man-Savior, who is also the God-man, the complete God and a perfect man, the mingling of the divine attributes with the human virtues. As the complete God, He has the divine nature with the divine attributes, and as a perfect man, He has the human nature with the human virtues. Therefore, in His Person we see the divine nature with its attributes and the human nature with its virtues for the living of a life in the highest standard of morality. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="mFzvXUhbhqpISr0cdDNguil1AZG80kf7bH6haSXLEJRmHfrjBcKo82-9Gg2bAZ_94">The New Testament Jubilee</h2><p data-content-id="ZOnBpaevoPlkI92KNKWpCtDTUxvcifQzDL7AE4fhd-GIrB27yf8bZOWtB76IdtGDS"> The mingling of the divine nature with its attributes and the human nature with its virtues to produce the highest standard of morality are for the New Testament jubilee. In this jubilee we are freed from all bondages—the bondage of sin, the bondage of Satan, the bondage of the world, and even the bondage of the self—and we are also freed into the full enjoyment of our lost birthright, the right to enjoy the Triune God in Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="229" id="229">[229]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="AUNZZyVVAVOomKProR2iXUO12JhGBpIJR1Zd6ilPf-0XAUbPCWwsUR_yeQ_zGl6pN"> What we have been covering in this message is a definition and interpretation of the Gospel of Luke. In this definition we see the intrinsic elements of this Gospel. If we read Luke in a superficial way, we shall be concerned mainly with the stories in this Gospel. But if we get into the depths of this book, we shall see its intrinsic elements. </p>
<p data-content-id="FyPO0Bs_RXrorVGata9dDrLFgpUWneMjMpEk0aYSfanBP0SA21ajMTzZdZb6Sdt3F"> If we have a proper description, definition, and interpretation of the Gospel of Luke, we shall see that his Gospel is composed with certain intrinsic elements. These elements include the Lord’s divine nature with its divine attributes and His human nature with its human virtues. The Man-Savior, therefore, is the composition of the mingling of God and man. As such a One, the Lord lived a life in the highest standard of morality. Such a life is for the New Testament jubilee, because it is a life that frees us from all bondage and that brings us into the enjoyment of the Triune God in Christ. This is a summary of the Gospel of Luke. </p>
<p data-content-id="Cx-Kq8f_kufcXTjbM_AhJ_18OaHzT6d8wbuRcXv4ortX3gIXqwulpXeobzCQdoJJ1"> We need to have an understanding of this summary of Luke when we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69357" data-verses="Luke 11:1">chapter eleven</span>. Otherwise, this chapter may bother us. After the parable of the good Samaritan and after the case of Martha receiving the Lord Jesus into her home, Luke inserts a chapter that covers four matters: the Man-Savior’s teaching about prayer (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69358" data-verses="Luke 11:1-13">11:1-13</span>), the Man-Savior rejected by the evil generation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69359" data-verses="Luke 11:14-32">vv. 14-32</span>), His warning not to be in darkness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69360" data-verses="Luke 11:33-36">vv. 33-36</span>), and His rebuking of the Pharisees and lawyers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69361" data-verses="Luke 11:37-54">vv. 37-54</span>). Why are these four things put together? If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69362" data-verses="Luke 11:1">Luke 11</span> superficially, we shall not understand why this chapter includes the Lord’s teaching on prayer, the rejection of Him by the evil generation, His warning not to be in darkness, and His rebuking the Pharisees and lawyers. However, if we get into the depths of these four sections of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69363" data-verses="Luke 11:1">chapter eleven</span>, we shall see that here the Man-Savior is dealing with the highest standard of morality. We have emphasized the fact that based upon His divine nature with His divine attributes mingled with His human nature with His human virtues to produce the highest standard of morality, the Man-Savior proclaimed the New Testament jubilee. Now we must go on to see that <span class="pg" data-page-id="230" id="230">[230]</span> apart from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69364" data-verses="Luke 11:1">chapter eleven</span> it would be difficult for us to experience the jubilee. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="PIjOD0qFuTXceUSZsDmZDYcE0eeqSfaj3wRhOBw1FeXJDCmFaOPLe_ykOCcLaqUht">PRAYING OURSELVES INTO GOD</h2><p data-content-id="-L1fy_zrwSJXUU5n-uXTQTRsvBf8gL-7zbw6oEqqqLY7uMvSfrnIP_SgjrRC490ZA"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69365" data-verses="Luke 11:1-13">11:1-13</span> we have the Man-Savior’s teaching on prayer. If we read this section carefully again and again, we shall see that prayer means that we pray ourselves into God. When some hear this, they may say, “We cannot find such a point in the pattern of prayer set up by the Lord Jesus in His teaching. How can you say that to pray is to pray ourselves into God?” Apparently, this matter is not found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69366" data-verses="Luke 11:1-13">11:1-13</span>. Actually, in these verses we see that to pray is to pray ourselves into God. </p>
<p data-content-id="pQRuKAJlDonWZe7uRYRG1fCH2ZE-H030jYTeXH3ooRncRbKpIKHOqeYDJyj9C--Un"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69367" data-verses="Luke 11:1">Luke 11:1</span> says, “And it came about that when He was praying in a certain place, as He ceased, a certain one of His disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.” We do not know what the Lord was praying for. When the disciples saw Him praying, they wanted Him to teach them to pray. Then the Lord went on to say, “When you pray, say, Father, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come. Give us each day our bread for the day; and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone indebted to us. And do not bring us into trial” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69368" data-verses="Luke 11:2-4">vv. 2-4</span>). I have spent much time considering this brief word. My conclusion is that if we would pray this way again and again, the result will be that we shall pray ourselves into God. In other words, the issue of this prayer is that we find ourselves in God. </p>
<p data-content-id="vOVAPClIw9o-SMbO_MllH3yn2shm1hmqQ-J4zvC1dCk_Dq1MQU0ZikmVpJu7Jramo"> If we pray according to the Lord’s teaching in these verses, we shall be persons in God. I encourage you to pray, “Father, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come.” If you pray this a number of times, you will find that you are in God. This is both my understanding and my experience. From experience I can testify that to pray according to the Lord’s instruction is to pray ourselves into God. </p>
<p data-content-id="WVNqXX68ZMdi0Is0K3yrCbWMw6vNnBJsEhQPV8kOVHacHdtLj25qcwOhqs0Rn3f7G"> Once we have prayed ourselves into God, what shall we do now that we are in God? We shall simply receive Him with His riches into us. As fallen human beings, we were <span class="pg" data-page-id="231" id="231">[231]</span> altogether outside of God and had nothing to do with His riches. Hence, we could not enjoy the riches of God. We need to pray ourselves into God and then, as those in Him, receive Him and His riches. </p>

This section begins with the account of the casting out of a demon: “And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute; and it occurred that when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds marveled.” Dumbness by demon possession signifies the inability to speak for God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69388" data-verses="Isaiah 56:10">Isa. 56:10</span>) and praise God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69389" data-verses="Isaiah 35:6">Isa. 35:6</span>) due to the worship of dumb idols (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69390" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:2">1 Cor. 12:2</span>). The speaking of the mute man here signifies the recovery of the speaking and praising ability by being filled with the Lord in the spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69391" data-verses="Ephesians 5:18-19">Eph. 5:18-19</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="TNosbqa7UDYgYcvAALM1nbJ_AhIjoMFZ1RknVLQVa51Kalz7wwEWcHnDTjWi7J3AL"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69392" data-verses="Luke 11:15">Luke 11:15</span>, some said, “He casts out the demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.” The name “Beelzebub” means the lord of the flies, the name of the god of the Ekronites (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69393" data-verses="2Kings 1:2">2 Kings 1:2</span>). It was changed in contempt by the Jews to Baalzebel, which means lord of the dunghill, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="236" id="236">[236]</span> used for the ruler of the demons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69394" data-verses="Matthew 12:24">Matt. 12:24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69395" data-verses="Matthew 12:27">27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69396" data-verses="Mark 3:22">Mark 3:22</span>). Those in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69397" data-verses="Luke 11:15">Luke 11:15</span> reviled the Man-Savior by saying that He cast out demons by the ruler of the demons. This most blasphemous name expressed their strongest objection and rejection. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="O6A_Zpet8NpkAD120xXVI9X96Jkgmribh2Ghh9n9QaeX9vJyetjJM0RwCL0BYvdJK">CASTING OUT DEMONS BY THE FINGER OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="454lFLK2tydPg5el9FmBbdHpHQtD5QB0eD81SP4uSuDpX_AQORq44Je3A02kXbzxC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69398" data-verses="Luke 11:17-18">verses 17 and 18</span> the Lord went on to say to those who accused Him of casting out demons by Beelzebub, “Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and a house divided against a house falls. And if also Satan is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? Because you say that I cast out the demons by Beelzebub.” The Lord’s word indicates that Satan has a kingdom. Satan is the ruler of this world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69399" data-verses="John 12:31">John 12:31</span>) and the ruler of the power of the air (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69400" data-verses="Ephesians 2:2">Eph. 2:2</span>). He has his authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69401" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>) and his angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69402" data-verses="Matthew 25:41">Matt. 25:41</span>), who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69403" data-verses="Ephesians 6:12">Eph. 6:12</span>). Hence, he has his kingdom, the authority of darkness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69404" data-verses="Colossians 1:13">Col. 1:13</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="ov0pwXq8uOJOycOiH2KN-c2IpYzHGrTUx1Dbcc3jku5CrgeFN6HqgZR5btlLER604"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69405" data-verses="Luke 11:19-20">Luke 11:19 and 20</span> say, “But if I by Beelzebub cast out the demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. But if I by the finger of God cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.” The “finger of God” is a Hebraistic expression. The finger (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69406" data-verses="Luke 11:46">v. 46</span>) is smaller than the hand and the arm. To cast out the demons does not need the hand of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69407" data-verses="John 10:28">John 10:28</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69408" data-verses="John 10:29">29</span>) nor the arm of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69409" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isa. 53:1</span>); just the finger of God is powerful enough to do this. Yet it is still done by the Spirit of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69410" data-verses="Matthew 12:28">Matt. 12:28</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="37AX-gTuAtUIfnNeMUqh6nFkDbtYWR3LTu6iLVxczyu6wYZF7FopoaS4d9S_W-BJ4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69411" data-verses="Luke 11:21-22">verses 21 and 22</span> the Lord continues, “When the strong man fully armed guards his own house, his possessions are in peace; but when a stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him, he takes away his whole armor on which he had relied, and distributes his spoil.” The strong man here is Satan, the evil one, and the house signifies the kingdom of Satan. But Christ, the Son of God, is much stronger than Satan, the strong man. </p>
<p data-content-id="Gn7ewN6nSdByHJgqlR3gXUUOe-1UTJncAcUqo6emH0AAxLxRlyu8isObL6a-GDD-q"> The first section of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69412" data-verses="Luke 11:1">Luke 11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69413" data-verses="Luke 11:1-13">verses 1 through 13</span>, is wonderful. Here we see the matter of praying ourselves into God <span class="pg" data-page-id="237" id="237">[237]</span> and remaining in Him to receive the life supply, the riches of the Holy Spirit. Now in the second section we have demons, the ruler of the demons, and the strong man. This indicates that as we are in God receiving His riches, we need to remember that demons are around us wherever we may be, and there are evil spirits in the air. Hence, a war is raging all the time. Therefore, the Man-Savior teaches us not only to pray ourselves into God and remain in Him to receive His Spirit as the riches of the life supply, but He also reveals that He is working to cast out demons. </p>
<p data-content-id="crbZLnwlQe1t-R2NOEEjvLAIu5vZMDiBZWVp3fX5a8i7iFrksEzKqpk9CFqNeA0KZ"> If we get into the depths of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69414" data-verses="Luke 11:1">Luke 11</span>, we shall see that when we enjoy the riches of God by remaining in Him, we shall realize that we are in a situation that is full of demons. Therefore, we should never expect that today there can be heaven on earth. No, there are many demons, many obstacles and hindrances to the New Testament jubilee. In the jubilee people are set free from the possession and oppression of the demons. Nevertheless, the demons are still present, and many people cooperate with them. Those who cooperate with the demons are used by Satan to damage the New Testament jubilee. But the Man-Savior is here to cast out the demons. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y58zRdwVwZdOug4OiuHYXzOi5YTN0tMwYIpE2xtAxeB5rWIwx_UI_h1Cxbmt9gLsn"> We have seen that the Devil is likened to a strong man. But the Man-Savior is stronger than this strong man. The Lord is so strong that in order to cast out demons it is not necessary for Him to use His arm or even His hand. It is sufficient for Him to use only His finger. Simply by using His finger, the Man-Savior is able to cast out demons. </p>

Then he goes and takes along other spirits more evil than himself, seven of them, and he enters and makes his home there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.” We need to understand the spiritual significance of this word. The significance here is that after we have been cleansed from the possession of the demons, we may still be empty, not filled with the life supply of the Spirit. In other words, inwardly we are not occupied by God and with God. </p>

Because we are filled with the riches of the divine supply, we are full of light and we can illumine others. This light then brings us into Christ as the One who passed through death and entered into resurrection. Now we can experience Him as the real Jonah and the real Solomon. In Him as the real Solomon we know the wisdom of God, the eternal purpose of God, and the economy of God. In this economy we enjoy the mystery of God. This mystery is Christ as the expression of God and the church as the expression of Christ. This is the real jubilee. </p>

As we consider these chapters, we need to realize that our natural understanding of the holy Word is altogether not reliable. In order to understand <span class="pg" data-page-id="244" id="244">[244]</span> any book of the Bible, we need to know the principles and elements according to which that book was written.

We need to remember that the Lord’s words recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69465" data-verses="Luke 11:1">chapter eleven</span> were spoken as He was approaching Jerusalem. This means that while He was teaching the disciples concerning spiritual things, He was approaching Jerusalem. </p>

Those living in Jerusalem cared for religion and for earthly possessions in order to enjoy a better life. Therefore, as the capital <span class="pg" data-page-id="245" id="245">[245]</span> of Judea, Jerusalem was characterized by religion and culture with its enjoyment of material things. </p>

We have seen that this teaching was given on the way to Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="uZQjh9ACdCObo73nCgamaKwDnu18yBYq6-Sf_S2e8ePelXrhqcHNu9IrQr-mDbhX0"> As the Lord and His disciples were on the way from Galilee to Jerusalem, His heart was set on one thing, and the heart of His disciples was set on another thing. The Lord’s heart was set on His death. He was going to Jerusalem to die to the religion and culture found there. He was not going to Jerusalem to participate in those things. In Jerusalem the Lord would die to religion and culture; He would die to this present life and all earthly possessions. The Lord’s disciples had something very different on their heart. Their concept was that their Master was going to Jerusalem to receive the kingdom. This enables us to understand why John and James, the sons of thunder, asked the Lord that they might sit with Him on His right and on His left in His kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69467" data-verses="Mark 10:35-45">Mark 10:35-45</span>). Their hearts were full of the thought of the kingdom. Their Master had been a great success in Galilee and now, they thought, was the time for Him to go to the capital, to Jerusalem, to take the throne and receive the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="f5f0VDzn9jkRQSn1Nw1f8bRwlK3eq6Siv45D3Z1PVOSaG41wTyIuG2c1MeKQAjvFj"> But in the Lord’s heart was the thought of going to Jerusalem to die. The Lord did not appreciate either religion or culture with its earthly possessions. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69468" data-verses="Luke 12:1">chapter twelve</span> Luke puts together certain instances in order to show that the Lord had no heart for religion or for the earthly possessions in Jerusalem. </p>

Nowhere is hypocrisy more prevailing than in religion. Religion is a field, a realm, for hypocrisy to prevail. Consider the hypocrisy in the Jewish religion when the Lord Jesus was on earth. What hypocrisy there was among the Pharisees, scribes, and lawyers! In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69470" data-verses="Matthew 23:1">Matthew 23</span> the Lord pronounced woes upon them for their hypocrisy. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69471" data-verses="Luke 12:1">12:1</span> the Lord exposes the hypocrisy of the Jewish religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IOMTVFyfrPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69472" data-verses="Luke 12:1">12:1</span> we see that the religious hypocrisy of the Pharisees was equal to leaven. In the New Testament leaven signifies the element of corruption. Here the Lord warns us to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. The Pharisees were false and practiced falsehood to the uttermost. Their falsehood became a hypocrisy that was the leaven, the element of corruption, in the Jewish religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="kAQNthUaZvalgvsKFtDCeBsJbCrdyQWj0UWwMbQUlst1TdatH57vU3-PT1x1LNEeo"> All of the Lord’s disciples were Jews. Since they all came out of a Jewish source, they had a deep appreciation of the Jewish religion and a high regard for the Pharisees. They thought that the Pharisees were those with a high morality. But as the Man-Savior was approaching Jerusalem, the center of hypocritical religion, He began to expose the hypocrisy of that religion to His followers. Therefore, He said to the disciples, “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Jgkr79uXp4nHSqPJwFIf1Mcwm7qGnaecC8bfNtJTx_m3Ubj0zJ3n8sOq8U2GgJfUN"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69473" data-verses="Luke 12:2-12">12:2-12</span> the Lord went on to tell His disciples that the hypocrisy of religion would eventually lead to the persecution of His sincere and honest followers. Religious hypocrisy always becomes a source of persecution to the genuine followers of Jesus. As those who would be in the New Testament jubilee today, we need to beware of the hypocrisy in religion, for this hypocrisy will become a source of persecution. As the genuine followers of the Lord are enjoying the jubilee, they will be opposed by the hypocritical ones in the hypocritical religion. This opposition will develop into persecution, a persecution of the genuine followers of the Lord Jesus who are experiencing the New Testament jubilee. <span class="pg" data-page-id="247" id="247">[247]</span> </p>

Luke places these two warnings together in a significant continuation. In Jerusalem there was not only the peril of religious hypocrisy, but also the peril of the covetousness of material possessions. </p>

Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69498" data-verses="Luke 12:49-53">12:49-53</span> He expressed the longing to be released through His death. Here we see that the Lord aspired to be fully released from the bondage of His flesh. This short portion of the Word is very deep, and we need adequate spiritual experience in order to understand it. </p>
<p data-content-id="f5f0VDzn9jkRQSn1Mylf1IRwlK3eq6Siv45D3Z1PVOSaG41wTyIuG2c1MeKQAjvFj"> When I was in Shanghai more than fifty years ago, I read a book by Brother T. Austin-Sparks entitled <em>The Release of the Lord.</em> That book made reference to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69499" data-verses="Luke 12:49-50">12:49 and 50</span>. The writer pointed out that the Lord, in His incarnation was bound and concealed in His flesh. He was God, and He had the divine life as His essence, strength, and power. Nevertheless, He was concealed in His humanity, which was a restriction to His divine being. Therefore, He needed to be released through death; that is, He desired that His divine being would be released through death. </p>
<p data-content-id="IpVW-KDk2ZPgTnA3ZDDrZrV6ISFzZIDAsieA6ADySAHJiaJ_KT5O4yrRjpf5t_Bzi"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69500" data-verses="Luke 12:49-50">Luke 12:49 and 50</span> correspond to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69501" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>: “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and <span class="pg" data-page-id="254" id="254">[254]</span> dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.” Here the Lord likens Himself to a grain of wheat. If a grain of wheat does not fall into the earth and die, it will abide alone and remain the same. But when it falls into the ground and dies, the death of that grain releases the life within it. We may say that death becomes a release to the inner life of the grain of wheat. Through such a release, the riches of the life of the grain of wheat come forth to produce many grains. The Lord Jesus as a grain of wheat fell into the ground and lost His soulish life through death so that He might release His eternal life in resurrection to the many grains. </p>
<p data-content-id="DoAIPBJjBHkq_0FWY5DCgdupXz6H4o4mOlsgbBKk_d-ko1FGk9fqp5bptFLQcr1Cs"> When we compare <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69502" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span> with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69503" data-verses="Luke 12:49-50">Luke 12:49 and 50</span>, we see that both portions of the Scriptures describe the release of the divine life, or the release of the divine being of the Lord’s Person. As God, the Lord Jesus possessed the unlimited eternal life. However, this unlimited life was greatly restricted and restrained in His humanity, in His flesh. Therefore, the Lord was anxious and desirous for the release of His divine life. Once the divine life was released from within Him, He could impart it into His many believers. This is the basic thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69504" data-verses="Luke 12:49-53">12:49-53</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="SlZ9LfzTj9oNzJ6-ubC1I4W-FtUqhJ-Hu1E2vmyVDkctfWDUrJm1vTh_wbOlz4rGj">COMING TO CAST FIRE ON EARTH</h2><p data-content-id="gIbolEPmx05b9aaM8JtXe9D6mLMAfdyt6RkK1EfHgPUcUpUKFw_EQp0WLDUU4a_bg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69505" data-verses="Luke 12:49">12:49</span> the Lord Jesus says, “I came to cast fire on the earth, and what can I desire if it has already been kindled?” This “fire” is the impulse of the spiritual life, which comes from the Lord’s released divine life and which causes the divisions mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69506" data-verses="Luke 12:51-53">verses 51 through 53</span>. In these verses we see that there will be divisions even in the families of the believers. These divisions come from the fire which is the impulse of the spiritual life, and this impulse comes from the Lord’s released divine life. His life was concealed, and the Lord wanted it to be released. He wanted the fire to burst into flame. </p>
<p data-content-id="eZHFLAbNWwOTr1-IpvSDphNBlkr6ZBJMGzugC7yI_anSHrEw64TAXVbz6cBzraKtb"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69507" data-verses="Luke 12:49">verse 49</span> the Lord says, “What can I desire if it has already been kindled?” This part of the verse may also be rendered, “How I wish that it were already kindled!” This indicates that the fire was not kindled before the Lord’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="255" id="255">[255]</span> death. We know from the record in the book of Acts that after the Lord’s death this fire became a flame. </p>

The cup signified that His death was the God-given portion for Him to take for the sinners whom He would redeem for God. Baptism denoted that His death was the God-ordained way for Him to pass through for the accomplishment of God’s redemption for sinners. </p>
<p data-content-id="tm_3_WpwudCvX6CkTooA4tXM1GTBpy9OgG7uBMDbsNsUIce-CSAdVjV8DKlJDOLGv"> The Greek word rendered “pressed” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69510" data-verses="Luke 12:50">Luke 12:50</span> may also be translated “constrained.” The Lord was constrained in His flesh, which He put upon Himself in His incarnation. He needed to die, to be baptized, in physical death so that His unlimited and infinite divine being with His divine life might be released from His flesh. His divine life, after being released through His physical death, became the impulse of His believers’ spiritual life in resurrection. </p>

When He came, peace came, for He brought peace to mankind. When He was born, the multitude of the heavenly army praised God and said, “Glory in the highest places to God, and on earth peace among men of His good pleasure” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69512" data-verses="Luke 2:14">2:14</span>). Hence, the coming of the Savior rendered glory to God in the heavens and brought peace to men on earth. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69513" data-verses="Ephesians 2:14">Ephesians 2:14</span> Paul even says that Christ is our peace. But, in another sense, the Lord did not come to <span class="pg" data-page-id="256" id="256">[256]</span> give peace but rather division. This division is due to the satanic life in the unbelievers struggling against the divine life in the believers—a conflict between the satanic kingdom and the kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mixvss-j9tzRFTxyof58GYRNaqOl6bARPohV1ILcl2Rfd6ZbvrtmR-ZjJ-Sa8BhLR"> The Lord spoke a similar word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69514" data-verses="Matthew 10:34">Matthew 10:34</span>: “Do not suppose that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.” The whole earth is under Satan’s usurpation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69515" data-verses="1John 5:19">1 John 5:19</span>). The Lord Jesus came to call some out from his usurpation. This certainly arouses Satan’s opposition, and he instigates the ones under his usurpation to fight against those called by the Lord. To be sure, the Lord’s coming did not bring peace but a sword. </p>
<p data-content-id="VnpGtuJZc2t4WkT0XbPTqLQs9FrNE0CWBPCyIGrj5PYt8QUzResVcYufIW_qbioEP"> The conflict between the satanic life and the divine life is actually a warfare between the kingdom of Satan and the kingdom of God. A kingdom is a matter of life; that is, a certain kind of kingdom has a certain kind of life. For example, we may speak of the vegetable kingdom. The vegetable kingdom depends on the vegetable life. In the same principle, the human kingdom depends on the human life, and the kingdom of God depends on the life of God. Since we have the life of God, we have the reality of the kingdom of God, and we are in this reality. But the unbelievers, who live by the life of Satan, are in another realm, another kingdom. This means that they are in the reality of the satanic kingdom. The kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan certainly do not agree but are contrary to each other. Hence, there is a struggle between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan, and this struggle causes division. </p>
<p data-content-id="iKUb-yZjUMq0U5rbIwmQVPCKhlmsitCl_HgCC1JygvKdbgTH8NQIWMexx8ZGM2f34"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69516" data-verses="Luke 12:52">Luke 12:52</span> the Lord continues, “From now on there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.” This kind of division has taken place again and again throughout the last nineteen centuries. </p>
<p data-content-id="10Y2CNEKWaUAkDvQ0ksa81LffZ6_98e4N8ozCPPMzkmQPd2gHT1E_ldnAuur5g5vG"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69517" data-verses="Luke 12:53">verse 53</span> the Lord goes on to say, “They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against the mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.” Here Luke characteristically mentions the details. The kind of division described here is not pleasant, for <span class="pg" data-page-id="257" id="257">[257]</span> it is due to the struggle between two lives, the divine life and the satanic life. </p>
<p data-content-id="9ja0oN4pSUA1PfKrXQsCWwW84jNQuXvNrAFRd3n77So0-KjQ2N1zKueNosjiAaC8D"> We have seen from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69518" data-verses="Luke 12:51-53">12:51-53</span> that there will be division caused by the satanic life in the unbelievers struggling against the divine life in the believers. We have pointed out that this is a conflict between the satanic kingdom and the kingdom of God. </p>

The Lord uses the two incidents in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69548" data-verses="Luke 13:1-5">13:1-5</span> to remind the Jews that now is the time for them to repent. Otherwise, they will all perish like the victims of those two incidents. </p>
<p data-content-id="8rK9hZU17CqFQv_7Z-sMWGzV076l38frJWrb3fYskUnsCbvB8WxSNVgXi8Bko75qT"> The Lord’s word at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69549" data-verses="Luke 12:56">chapter twelve</span> indicated that He wanted the Jews to repent. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69550" data-verses="Luke 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> He continues to speak further concerning repentance. Referring to the case of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate mixed with their sacrifices, He said to those present, “Do you think that these Galileans were sinners beyond all the Galileans because they suffered these things? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you shall all likewise perish.” Then <span class="pg" data-page-id="262" id="262">[262]</span> He goes on to refer to a second case, the case of the “eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69551" data-verses="Luke 13:4">v. 4</span>). Again the Lord warned the people to repent. He seemed to be telling them, “Don’t think that those people were sinful, and the others were not. Unless you repent, you also will perish.” </p>
<p data-content-id="HjWwmoGOlsak0TUDQDy_sclVb6Y9pPEtBKlHqojq6TpIxbKDnyfW41Pa33wfqt__Y"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69552" data-verses="Luke 13:6-9">verses 6 through 9</span> the Lord goes on to tell the parable of a certain man who had a fig tree planted in his vineyard. The word “and” at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69553" data-verses="Luke 13:6">verse 6</span> indicates that these verses are the continuation of the foregoing verses concerning repentance. </p>
<p data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IONRVFydrPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW"> This parable indicates that God as the owner came in the Son to the Jewish people as to a fig tree (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69554" data-verses="Matthew 21:19">Matt. 21:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69555" data-verses="Jeremiah 24:2">Jer. 24:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69556" data-verses="Jeremiah 24:5">5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69557" data-verses="Jeremiah 24:8">8</span>) planted in God’s promised land as the vineyard (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69558" data-verses="Matthew 21:33">Matt. 21:33</span>) to seek fruit from them. He had been seeking for three years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69559" data-verses="Luke 13:7">Luke 13:7</span>), and He did not find any. He wanted to cut them down, but the Son as the vinedresser prayed for them that God the Father would tolerate them until He died for them (dug the ground around the fig tree) and gave them fertilizer (threw on manure), hoping that they would then repent and produce fruit. Otherwise, they would be cut down. The passages in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69560" data-verses="Luke 11:29-32">11:29-32</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69561" data-verses="Luke 11:42-52">42-52</span>, unveiling the Jewish people as an evil generation, confirm this interpretation. </p>
<p data-content-id="kAQNthUaZvalgvsKEvDCdBMJbCrdyQWj0UWwMbQUlst1TdatH57vU3-PT1x1LNEeo"> In this parable the Jewish people are regarded by God as a fig tree. When God did not find fruit on the tree, He was thinking to cut it off. But the vinedresser, the Lord Jesus, begged the Father not to do this until, by means of His death, He dug around the tree. Then if the tree still did not bring forth fruit, it could be cut down. This is actually what took place. Because the Jews did not repent, even after the Lord Jesus died and resurrected and the Spirit came, the “fig tree” was “cut down.” This happened in A.D. 70 when Titus brought his Roman army to Jerusalem and destroyed it. That destruction of Jerusalem was the cutting down of the fig tree. </p>

And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bent double and utterly unable to stand erect.” This “spirit” was a demon, one of the spirits of the living creatures who lived in the preadamic age and were judged by God when they joined Satan’s rebellion. The fallen angels work with Satan in the air (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69564" data-verses="Ephesians 2:2">Eph. 2:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69565" data-verses="Ephesians 6:11-12">6:11-12</span>), and these demons, unclean spirits, move with him on the earth. Both act evilly upon man for the kingdom of Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="aJBHB16Du0i39s63t9745m_cHmEpg--JpExe5woWN23707a7BR6E28G078JPrLzJy"> Because of a spirit of infirmity, this woman was “bent double.” Literally, the Greek words rendered “bent double” mean “bending together.” This may signify the demon’s oppression over a person to an extreme extent, so that the person is bent toward the satanic world only and is unable to stand erect to look into the heavens. </p>
<p data-content-id="baXaoDjM31g4vdogJO4_DnpsY6kl2rRDOpin976WeiNY5gEGyluhr_T3XIAmn92Sv"> The Lord Jesus saw the woman who was bent double, utterly unable to stand erect, but forced to look down to the earth as a result of the operation exercised upon her by Satan through his demons. The Lord said to her, “Woman, you have been released from your infirmity; and He laid His hands on her, and instantly she was made erect, and glorified God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69566" data-verses="Luke 13:12-13">vv. 12-13</span>). Here we see that the woman did not ask the Lord to heal her; rather, He initiated the healing and release of the bent-double and Satan-bound woman. </p>
<p data-content-id="qMcyXCf9JxgO6C4J_XPI28OtWR45eDmy97SasR1HjYltLhBmhnwtFer_oxArsFU1X"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69567" data-verses="Luke 13:14">Verse 14</span> says, “But the synagogue ruler, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, answered and said to the crowd, There are six days in which man should work; therefore come on them and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.” Here we see that Satan uses not only the evil spirit to possess the woman, but also the religious ruler to oppose the woman’s release by the Lord. Religion is much used by the usurper to keep God’s chosen people under his oppression. The synagogue ruler, who was very religious, cared for religious regulations and not for the suffering of this woman, who was a descendant of Abraham. <span class="pg" data-page-id="264" id="264">[264]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="y695EWmpNHnEWPC-trj1C32J3jSUoQBFyaZAx96FqVB_sFX0OYnWKsHhj6JUg1n-e"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69568" data-verses="Luke 13:15-16">verses 15 and 16</span> the Lord answered the ruler of the synagogue, “Hypocrites! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away, and give it a drink? And this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound—consider it—eighteen years, should she not be released from this bond on the Sabbath day?” The fact that this woman was a daughter of Abraham indicates that she was one of God’s chosen people. However, she was bound by Satan. This indicates that the demon’s possession of people is Satan’s binding of them. Hence, the casting out of the demon is the defeat of Satan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69569" data-verses="Matthew 12:29">Matt. 12:29</span>). It was fitting for this woman to be released from that bond on the Sabbath day, for the Sabbath was ordained by God for man to rest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69570" data-verses="Genesis 2:3">Gen. 2:3</span>), not for man to remain under bondage. </p>
<p data-content-id="8rK9hZU17CqFQv_7Z-sMeWDV076l38frJWrb3fYskUnsCbvB8WxSNVgXi8Bko75qT"> Why is this case put here by Luke? In answering this question, we need to remember that this took place as the Man-Savior was approaching Jerusalem, where the atmosphere was extremely religious. I believe that the Lord Jesus entered into the synagogue and initiated the healing of this woman in order to show His disciples that He had no intention of keeping the dead forms of religion and the deformed Sabbatical regulations. He purposely broke those regulations so that His disciples would know that He had come not to keep the regulations that hold people in their suffering, but to break the deformed regulations so that the suffering ones may be released by His jubilee blessing. </p>
<p data-content-id="0yMFLpTNFijhdJXKaAtsSVL0HDyobmW8BsYvNv_3Cioz9unzd69fVMg-p6C0n6Ifp"> When the Lord Jesus healed the woman who had been bound by Satan and bent double, He brought the jubilee to her. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69571" data-verses="Luke 4:1">chapter four</span> He had declared the jubilee, in which the captives would be released and the oppressed would be set free. This case, therefore, is a fulfillment of the proclamation of the jubilee in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69572" data-verses="Luke 4:1">chapter four</span>. The Lord’s intention was to let the disciples know that He was going to Jerusalem, not to observe religious regulations but to break them purposely so that the people might be brought into the jubilee. <span class="pg" data-page-id="265" id="265">[265]</span> </p>

However, here He does not speak of the kingdom in a positive sense. Up until now, the Lord’s word concerning the kingdom in Luke has been positive. But here He talks to the disciples concerning the kingdom in a negative way, teaching them about the kingdom as a grain of mustard (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69574" data-verses="Luke 13:18-19">vv. 18-19</span>) and as leaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69575" data-verses="Luke 13:20-21">vv. 20-21</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="K6HmpZJGTPRsiY1ai0-YIRZ34UlqtsBFDVHQgSo9S8is_l13ggA-7Yse3XgT2zYV3"> “And behold, a certain man suffering from dropsy was before Him.” Dropsy is a disease that causes the body to swell up because of fluid forming in the cavities and tissues. This may signify an inner abnormal function of life that causes spiritual death before God. </p>
<p data-content-id="lXx03sAZnH1566ErL8Qk3ZWN6YjVqHNC8OyUynANn47kviFgaPXvRFBN-BRclOuC0"> We do not know whether the man with dropsy came into the house on his own or if he was asked by the Pharisees to be there as a temptation to the Lord. In any case, it was sovereign of the Lord that this man was present. Those in the Pharisee’s house were watching to see what the Lord would do. He asked the lawyers and the Pharisees, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69637" data-verses="Luke 14:3">v. 3</span>). Then He took hold of the man suffering from dropsy, cured him, and sent him away (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69638" data-verses="Luke 14:4">v. 4</span>). Following this He said to them, “Which of you having a donkey or an ox that shall fall into a well, will not immediately pull it out on the Sabbath day? And they were not able <span class="pg" data-page-id="274" id="274">[274]</span> to reply to these things” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69639" data-verses="Luke 14:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>).

It is possible that the disciples may have received a wrong impression from this. They may have thought that the sabbatical regulations were right and that the religion of keeping the Sabbath was also right. Therefore, on this occasion the Lord took the opportunity to break the sabbatical regulations, that is, to break the Sabbath-keeping religion, in order to impress the disciples that He was going to Jerusalem, not to keep the religion there but to terminate it. This is the reason that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69641" data-verses="Luke 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> begins with a section concerning the breaking of religious regulations. The Lord did this purposely in order to show His disciples that He was not going to Jerusalem for the sake of the Sabbath-keeping religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="VnpGtuJZc2t4WkT0XbvTpLws9FrNE0CWBPCyIGrj5PYt8QUzResVcYufIW_qbioEP"> While the Lord Jesus was in the house of the Pharisee, He observed the situation among the Pharisees and lawyers. “He noticed how they were choosing the places of honor” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69642" data-verses="Luke 14:7">v. 7</span>), exalting themselves even in the matter of seating. Therefore, He told them a parable about not reclining in a place of honor when invited by anyone to a marriage feast, but instead sitting down in the last place (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69643" data-verses="Luke 14:8-10">vv. 8-10</span>). The Lord pointed out that if we take the place of honor, the one who invited us may come and say, “Give this one that place, and then you will begin with shame to occupy the last place” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69644" data-verses="Luke 14:9">v. 9</span>). The Lord went on to say that if we sit in the last place, the one who invited us will say, “Friend, come up higher,” and then we shall have glory before all those reclining at the table with us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69645" data-verses="Luke 14:10">v. 10</span>). The Lord concludes this parable by saying, “Because everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be <span class="pg" data-page-id="275" id="275">[275]</span> exalted” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69646" data-verses="Luke 14:11">v. 11</span>). The Lord’s teaching here is like that of a parent teaching his children how to behave. </p>
<p data-content-id="iKUb-yZjUMq0U5rbIwGQWPiKhlmsitCl_HgCC1JygvKdbgTH8NQIWMexx8ZGM2f34"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69647" data-verses="Luke 14:12-14">verses 12 through 14</span> the Lord said to the one who had invited Him, “When you make a meal or a dinner, do not call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your relatives, nor your rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return, and it becomes a repayment to you. But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, because they do not have anything with which to repay you; for it will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the righteous.” Those mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69648" data-verses="Luke 14:13">verse 13</span>—the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind—are the people whom God invited to His salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69649" data-verses="Luke 14:21">v. 21</span>). The resurrection of the righteous spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69650" data-verses="Luke 14:14">verse 14</span> is the resurrection of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69651" data-verses="John 5:29">John 5:29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69652" data-verses="Revelation 20:4-6">Rev. 20:4-6</span>), when God will reward the saints (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69653" data-verses="Revelation 11:18">Rev. 11:18</span>) at the Lord’s return (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69654" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:5">1 Cor. 4:5</span>). </p>

Then the Lord said to him, “A certain man was making a great dinner and invited many; and he sent his slave at the dinner hour to say to those who had been invited, Come, for it is now ready” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69657" data-verses="Luke 14:16-17">vv. 16-17</span>). This great dinner is different from the marriage feast in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69658" data-verses="Matthew 22:2-14">Matthew 22:2-14</span>. That marriage feast is for the reward of the kingdom. This great dinner is for God’s full salvation. God, as the certain man, has prepared His full salvation as a great dinner and sent the first apostles as His slaves to invite the Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69659" data-verses="Luke 14:16-17">Luke 14:16-17</span>). But because they were occupied by their riches, such as land, cattle, or a wife, they refused His invitation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69660" data-verses="Luke 14:18-20">vv. 18-20</span>). Then God sent the apostles to invite the street people—the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame. Because of their poverty and misery, they received God’s invitation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69661" data-verses="Luke 14:21-22">vv. 21-22a</span>). Yet God’s salvation still had room for more; so He sent His slaves to go <span class="pg" data-page-id="276" id="276">[276]</span> out further to the Gentile world, as the roads and hedges, to compel the Gentiles to come in and fill up the room of His salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69662" data-verses="Luke 14:22-23">vv. 22b-23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69663" data-verses="Acts 13:46-48">Acts 13:46-48</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69664" data-verses="Romans 11:25">Rom. 11:25</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="jXdlQ8xxZMxS77oeD-Ms33PSEOMlQ9s1jH8YQMk7cEhKguIbR9jLLFm6wFfxpAM7f"> In this parable the Lord’s intention was to let the Pharisees know that God had invited them to His great feast, but they had all asked to be excused. Each one of them denied God’s invitation. That made it necessary for God to go to those of the lower class—to the poor, crippled, blind, and lame. After that, because there was still room in God’s salvation, God sent His slaves into the Gentile world to gather more people into His feast. Therefore, eventually those who had first been invited by God—the Pharisees, the scribes, and the lawyers—will not be able to enter into the kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="TNosbqa7UDYgYcvABJs1vIZ_AhIjoMFZ1RknVLQVa51Kalz7wwEWcHnDTjWi7J3AL"> This parable is an excellent parable concerning salvation. In order to be saved it is not necessary for us to do anything. We simply need to answer God’s invitation. To be saved all we need to do is come and receive what God has prepared for us. As long as we answer His invitation and accept what He has prepared for us, we shall be saved. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nV3M-hxr_PahH5f0HO3BPOrmHTm7hkZMtOU1wXRdLUKzbd2Rwvo4ANlkJXwIqXfdH">SALVATION AND REWARD</h2><p data-content-id="6v5bqSZVkxM1HMGlTPBeNrm8O5Ww8o25b4qVQMP5MlzkvkTR8-sJeZYdiAzVYImAy"> God’s economy, however, includes more than salvation, It also includes the reward of entering into the blessing of the kingdom age. Hence, to be saved is one thing, and to receive the kingdom reward is another thing. This is the reason for the Lord’s teaching in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69665" data-verses="Luke 14:25-35">14:25-35</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="RZzGEogxd1MGIsl2bZ5kq2CHSdLcm5J3IdyqcTX_a5S28-G-Yz8OH2qUTV12ioiQD"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69666" data-verses="Luke 14:25-26">Verses 25 and 26</span> say, “Now great crowds were going along with Him, and He turned and said to them, If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and moreover, his own soul life also, he cannot be My disciple.” The tone here is very different from that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69667" data-verses="Luke 14:15-24">14:15-24</span>. For salvation there is no need for us to do anything. This means that for salvation there are no terms, no conditions. We simply need to answer God’s invitation and receive what He offers us and we are saved. But there is more to God’s economy than just being saved. After we are saved, we need to enter into the <span class="pg" data-page-id="277" id="277">[277]</span> coming kingdom to receive a reward. Therefore, to be saved by grace is one thing, and to be rewarded according to our following of the Lord is another thing. </p>
<p data-content-id="sd53dK7V3RACxeAheZJaoIPJWY7CXd4lKCZrOk5KHHUk8v9DyXsEuqfotQsdDEpDq"> We all need to see the difference between salvation and reward. It is significant that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69668" data-verses="Luke 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>, after an opening word concerning the breaking of the sabbatical regulations, goes on to speak concerning God’s salvation and God’s reward. God’s salvation is for us to enjoy the jubilee today, and His reward is for us to enjoy the jubilee in the coming age. </p>

To receive salvation is to be saved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69674" data-verses="Luke 13:23">13:23</span>); to follow the Lord is to enjoy Him as the blessing of God’s salvation. This requires us to renounce all, even our life, and to carry our own cross (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69675" data-verses="Luke 14:27">vv. 27</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69676" data-verses="Luke 14:33">33</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="SlZ9LfzTj9oNzJ6-uby1Aqm-FtUqhJ-Hu1E2vmyVDkctfWDUrJm1vTh_wbOlz4rGj"> We may think that the Lord Jesus teaches us only to love. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69677" data-verses="Luke 14:26">verse 26</span> He teaches us to hate. This is not religion; this is a matter in God’s economy. According to the Lord’s word here, we should hate those we love, not those we do not love. Especially we need to hate ourselves, even our own soul life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="282" id="282">[282]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="y695EWmpNHnEWPC-trD1C12J3jSUoQBFyaZAx96FqVB_sFX0OYnWKsHhj6JUg1n-e"> What we love in ourselves is not mainly our spirit or body but our soul. For example, you may go to a restaurant not because you love your body, but because you love your soul and want to enjoy life, which is to enjoy your soul. Actually, all forms of amusement, entertainment, and pleasures are for the enjoyment of the soul. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69678" data-verses="Luke 14:26">14:26</span> the Lord clearly says that if we do not hate our own soul life, we cannot be His disciples. We have received God’s salvation, but we must fulfill the requirement in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69679" data-verses="Luke 14:26">verse 26</span> in order to receive the reward. </p>

The believers in Christ have been crucified (terminated) with Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69681" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69682" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Rom. 6:6</span>).

This is to carry their own cross. Christ carried the cross first and then was crucified (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69685" data-verses="John 19:17-18">John 19:17-18</span>). But the believers in Him have been crucified first and then carry the cross so that they may remain in the termination of their old man. In this way the believers experience and enjoy Christ as their life and life supply. </p>
<p data-content-id="7WKyJ1T_uHk5hAsLMRc1oK8FJj4I670thJCRuFLar2G9usySzvd5B-MQRqEDy9EDO"> We need to be impressed with the fact that to carry our own cross means that we remain on the cross and keep our old man in the termination of the cross. Christ has already crucified us. As believers, we have received Christ and have been organically united with Him. Since we are organically united with Christ, we certainly can participate in His crucifixion. As we remain in this crucifixion, this termination, we carry our own cross and experience and enjoy Christ as our jubilee. </p>

<p data-content-id="xdxTxFZ3QLG06tmoXawONLKoarNeZMRzYj39H4NLabyTJr4rWTMePzQvvgQ8LEOaY"> We should not think that following the Lord Jesus is an insignificant matter.

Otherwise, while he is yet at a distance, he will send an envoy and ask for the terms of peace.” This illustration is also related to the cost of following the Lord.

If this happens, they will be fit neither for the soil, signifying the church as God’s farm (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69692" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">1 Cor. 3:9</span>) issuing in the coming kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69693" data-verses="Revelation 11:15">Rev. 11:15</span>), nor for the manure pile, signifying hell, the dirty place in the universe (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69694" data-verses="Revelation 21:8">Rev. 21:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69695" data-verses="Revelation 22:15">22:15</span>). They will be thrown out from the kingdom of God, especially from the glory of the kingdom in the millennium.

<p data-content-id="UwoI3MPYw_sWGgTUcS47SilGshtzOQ5LUvhTMmv7LdK1FIytONjnEzyH0ZWFVMBnz"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69707" data-verses="Luke 9:51">9:51—19:27</span> we have a record of the Man-Savior going from Galilee to Jerusalem. The Lord was going to Jerusalem in order to die so that through His death and resurrection He might bring in the jubilee. On the way to Jerusalem He encountered frustration from the religious people, especially from the Pharisees and lawyers. Many of the cases that took place on the way from Galilee to Jerusalem are related to the frustration caused by the religious ones. The cases in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69708" data-verses="Luke 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>, for example, concern the Pharisees. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69709" data-verses="Luke 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> the situation remains the same, even though the Lord has dealt with the darkened thoughts and nonsensical reasonings of the Pharisees. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Mixvss-j9tzRFTxyoe58AIhNaqOl6bARPohV1ILcl2Rfd6ZbvrtmR-ZjJ-Sa8BhLR">THE TRINITY DEPICTED IN THREE PARABLES</h2><p data-content-id="VnpGtuJZc2t4WkT0XaPTgZws9FrNE0CWBPCyIGrj5PYt8QUzResVcYufIW_qbioEP"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69710" data-verses="Luke 15:1-2">Luke 15:1 and 2</span> say, “Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were drawing near to Him to hear Him. And both the Pharisees and the scribes were grumbling, saying, This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.” The tax collectors and sinners were grateful to the Man-Savior and drew near to Him. But the religious people were bothered by this and grumbled that the Lord welcomed sinners and ate with them. It was due to this grumbling that the Lord told the three parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69711" data-verses="Luke 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69712" data-verses="Luke 15:3">v. 3</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="290" id="290">[290]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="iKUb-yZjUMq0U5rbIxmQedyKhlmsitCl_HgCC1JygvKdbgTH8NQIWMexx8ZGM2f34"> In answering the self-righteous Pharisees and scribes who condemned the Savior for eating with the sinners, He spoke three parables unveiling and depicting how the Divine Trinity works to bring sinners back through the Son by the Spirit to the Father. The Son came in His humanity as the Shepherd to find the sinner as a lost sheep and bring it back home (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69713" data-verses="Luke 15:4-7">vv. 4-7</span>). The Spirit seeks the sinner as a woman seeks carefully one lost coin until she finds it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69714" data-verses="Luke 15:8-10">vv. 8-10</span>). And the Father receives the repenting and returned sinner as a certain man receives his prodigal son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69715" data-verses="Luke 15:11-32">vv. 11-32</span>). The entire Divine Trinity treasures the sinner and participates in bringing him back to God. All three parables emphasize the love of the Divine Trinity more than the fallen condition and repentance of the penitent sinner. The divine love is fully expressed in the Son’s tender care as the good Shepherd, in the Spirit’s fine seeking as the treasure lover, and in the Father’s warm receiving as a loving father. </p>
<p data-content-id="nV3M-hxr_PahH5f0HPXBPMrmHTm7hkZMtOU1wXRdLUKzbd2Rwvo4ANlkJXwIqXfdH"> When I was young I heard much concerning how the loving father received the prodigal son. I also heard about the good shepherd. But it was not pointed out to me that in these three parables we can see the Trinity, with each parable referring to one of the Trinity. Clearly, the shepherd refers to the Son, the woman refers to the Spirit, and the father refers to the heavenly Father. Therefore, in these parables the Three of the Trinity are clearly depicted. </p>
<p data-content-id="6v5bqSZVkxM1HMGlTOheNpm8O5Ww8o25b4qVQMP5MlzkvkTR8-sJeZYdiAzVYImAy"> The sequence of the Trinity in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69716" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span> is different from that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69717" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69718" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> the sequence is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. But in Luke we first have the Son as the shepherd, then the Spirit as the woman, and finally the Father as the father receiving his returned son. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69719" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span> the sequence begins with the Son, goes to the Spirit, and leads to the Father. This sequence is exactly the same as that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69720" data-verses="Ephesians 2:18">Ephesians 2:18</span>: “For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.” According to this verse, our access first is in the Son and then through the Spirit. Through the Son and in the Spirit we have access unto the Father. This is our access <span class="pg" data-page-id="291" id="291">[291]</span> into the Triune God, access through the Son, in the Spirit, and unto the Father. </p>
<p data-content-id="RZzGEogxd1MGIsl2bYZkp2iHSdLcm5J3IdyqcTX_a5S28-G-Yz8OH2qUTV12ioiQD"> It is important for us to understand why the Son is mentioned first in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69721" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span>. The reason the Son is first is that in God’s salvation the One who comes, practically speaking, is the Son. The Son comes to accomplish redemption, which is the first need, because redemption is the foundation of our salvation. The redemption accomplished by Christ’s death on the cross is the base of God’s salvation. Once this foundation has been laid, we can build upon it. In order to accomplish redemption, the Son, portrayed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69722" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span> as the good shepherd, comes first. </p>
<p data-content-id="sd53dK7V3RACxeAheYparIvJWY7CXd4lKCZrOk5KHHUk8v9DyXsEuqfotQsdDEpDq"> Now that the Son has accomplished redemption, the Spirit comes to find us. The book of Acts indicates this. In the Gospels the Son came to accomplish redemption. After the accomplishment of redemption by the Son, we see from the book of Acts that the Spirit comes to seek us and find us. Because of the Spirit’s finding of us, we repent and come back to God the Father. Then, according to the third parable in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69723" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span>, the Father is waiting for us to come back. </p>
<p data-content-id="whXJpCNVhaMbONnpLoVlLEbV78Gr88OYrW5ZYazISocRSVFEj93Rh6WuKCXo2tcws"> What a wonderful sequence we have in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69724" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span>! The sequence here is not according to Persons of the Trinity; the sequence is according to the steps of God’s salvation, the salvation based on Christ’s redemption. God’s salvation is by the Son, through the Spirit, and unto the Father. </p>

One drachma was equivalent to a day’s wages. </p>
<p data-content-id="Cx-Kq8f_kufcXTjbN_whK-V8OaHzT6d8wbuRcXv4ortX3gIXqwulpXeobzCQdoJJ1"> The lamp signifies the word of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69730" data-verses="Psalms 119:105">Psa. 119:105</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69731" data-verses="Psalms 119:130">130</span>) used by the Spirit to enlighten and expose the sinner’s position and condition so that he may repent. </p>

The word “sweep” indicates the searching and cleansing of the inside of a sinner. The Son’s finding in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69733" data-verses="Luke 15:4">verse 4</span> is outside the sinner, completed at the cross through His redemptive death.

And he distributed to them his living.” The word “share” refers to the Son’s inheritance by birth. The Greek word “living” is <em>bios</em> (life). This word denotes the present state of existence, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69739" data-verses="Luke 8:14">8:14</span>; by implication, the means of livelihood, as here and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69740" data-verses="Mark 12:44">Mark 12:44</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="293" id="293">[293]</span>. “His living” refers to what the father had to live on, the father’s livelihood, his substance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69741" data-verses="Luke 15:30">v. 30</span>). </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69785" data-verses="Luke 15:4-7">15:4-7</span> the Son as the Shepherd goes into the wilderness to seek the lost sheep. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69786" data-verses="Luke 15:8-10">15:8-10</span> we have the Spirit as the woman lighting a lamp, sweeping the house, and seeking carefully for a lost silver coin. The “house” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69787" data-verses="Luke 15:8">verse 8</span> refers to our being. The Spirit comes into us as the house to enlighten us. Finally, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69788" data-verses="Luke 15:11-32">15:11-32</span>, the Father receives the returned prodigal son. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sd53dK7V3RACxeAheY5ata_JWY7CXd4lKCZrOk5KHHUk8v9DyXsEuqfotQsdDEpDq">THE FATHER’S HOUSE</h2><p data-content-id="whXJpCNVhaMbONnpLoFlCX7V78Gr88OYrW5ZYazISocRSVFEj93Rh6WuKCXo2tcws"> In the parable of the loving father, the father must have been outside the door of his dwelling when he saw his son approaching (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69789" data-verses="Luke 15:20">v. 20</span>). The father saw his son even while “he was still a long way off.” This would not have been possible if the father had been in the house. Therefore, the father must have been outside the door looking for the son. Eventually, the father with the son came back into the father’s dwelling. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lj54LQasZ-K8EIg0M8gBq0pk1nfFprp5qpL9M39N7uxjTamFkVxVWNhxhdjVx7yWi"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69790" data-verses="Luke 15:25">Luke 15:25</span> refers to the father’s house. What is signified by the father’s house here? Christians may interpret the father’s house as signifying a heavenly mansion. According <span class="pg" data-page-id="298" id="298">[298]</span> to this interpretation, when a sinner repents and comes back to God, one day God will receive him into a heavenly mansion. This understanding of the father’s house is not logical. It is not logical to say that we have come back to the Father and He has received us and yet we are still not in His house. Where, then, are we? Luke indicates in this parable that the prodigal son was received into the house immediately after he returned, and in the house there was a place to prepare food and a place to dine. </p>
<p data-content-id="dvWnnIN7e0JKw-7c6KXxsqFKvbCR3lHyth-Z-qR8i3gE62O3MzE72ycw46N8mvBgO"> To be sure, the father’s house in the parable does not refer to heaven. If this house signifies heaven, then where are we who have been saved and who have been received by the Father, since we are not yet in heaven? Actually, the father’s house here should signify the church. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69791" data-verses="Luke 10:1">chapter ten</span> the church is signified by the inn. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69792" data-verses="Luke 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> the church is the father’s house. This understanding is logical and scriptural. </p>
<p data-content-id="QS_uuvFcVjx6uGVtMuuBZCQnlYKY1jnXQkbZwmBnmy1XcRsI7z2kVs1C7kIjs7vSf"> In the parable of the loving father there is no time gap between the coming back of the prodigal son and the father’s receiving him into his house.

<p data-content-id="O6A_Zpet8NpkAD121yHVI8X96Jkgmribh2Ghh9n9QaeX9vJyetjJM0RwCL0BYvdJK"> Now we need to ask in what way the Son as the Shepherd came to seek us. In contrast to the Spirit signified by the woman with the lamp, the Son does not seek us by enlightening us. His way to seek us out is to die for us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69793" data-verses="John 10:11">John 10:11</span> the Lord Jesus says that He is the good Shepherd who gives His life for the sheep: “I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.” The work of <span class="pg" data-page-id="299" id="299">[299]</span> the Shepherd is to die for us.

As this seeking woman, the Spirit enlightens our inner being little by little in a fine careful way. The Spirit enlightens our mind, then our emotion and will, and then our conscience and our entire heart. It is in this way that the Spirit “finds” us. </p>
<p data-content-id="37AX-gTuAtUIfnNeNX6h6mFkDbtYWR3LTu6iLVxczyu6wYZF7FopoaS4d9S_W-BJ4"> As the result of the Spirit’s finding us through enlightening us, we wake up and come to ourselves and realize how foolish it is to stay where we are. We do not wake ourselves up; on the contrary, we are awakened by the enlightening of the seeking Spirit. This seeking, enlightening, and finding of the Spirit takes place neither in the wilderness nor on the cross; it happens in our heart. This results in repentance, which is a change in our mind that produces a change in the direction of our life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Gn7ewN6nSdByHJgqkSngXXUOe-1UTJncAcUqo6emH0AAxLxRlyu8isObL6a-GDD-q"> The fact that the Spirit’s finding us takes place within the “house” of our being reveals that we were lost in ourselves. We were lost in our mind, will, and emotion. We were not merely lost in the wilderness—we were lost in ourselves. Christ died on the cross to bring us back from the wilderness of the world, yet we remain lost in ourselves. Therefore, the Spirit finds us in ourselves. We can testify of this from our experience. When the Spirit enlightened our mind, emotion, will, conscience, and heart, then we began to repent. </p>
<p data-content-id="crbZLnwlQe1t-R2NPHUjvIAIu5vZMDiBZWVp3fX5a8i7iFrksEzKqpk9CFqNeA0KZ"> This repentance resulting from the enlightening of the Spirit is altogether an inward matter. No human being and no angel is able to do such a subjective work in us. This can be done only by the penetrating Spirit, for the Spirit is able to penetrate the depths of our being to enlighten us and expose us. Then we realize how foolish we are, we repent, and we decide to come back to the Father. As we have pointed out, the Father was waiting for us outside <span class="pg" data-page-id="300" id="300">[300]</span> the house. In order to meet the Father, it was necessary for us to come to His house. </p>

When the son came to himself and decided to go to his father, he prepared what he would say to him: “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69794" data-verses="Luke 15:18-19">15:18-19</span>). What would you have said to the father if you had been the prodigal son in this parable? Perhaps you would have said to yourself, “I am going back to my father’s house. But what shall I say, and what shall I do when I get there? Should I knock on the door? Should I call out, ‘Father, I’m home’? I feel ashamed and foolish for squandering everything my father gave me. I cannot bear to recall the way I have been living. I know for sure that my father will not be outside waiting for me. Probably he will be in the house relaxing and enjoying life. Everything is fine with him, but not with me. Oh, what shall I do when I get home?” </p>
<p data-content-id="DoAIPBJjBHkq_0FWY4TCjdOpXz6H4o4mOlsgbBKk_d-ko1FGk9fqp5bptFLQcr1Cs"> To the prodigal son’s great surprise, “While he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion; and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him affectionately” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69795" data-verses="Luke 15:20">v. 20</span>). Perhaps the prodigal said to himself, “This is like a dream! I didn’t call out or knock on the door, but my father comes running to me. Now he is embracing me and kissing me!” </p>

<p data-content-id="-L1fy_zrwSJXUU5n_uHTXDxsvBf8gL-7zbw6oEqqqLY7uMvSfrnIP_SgjrRC490ZA"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69809" data-verses="Luke 16:1">Chapter sixteen</span> of the Gospel of Luke is actually a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69810" data-verses="Luke 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>. This is proved strongly by the fact that the first word in the first verse is “and.” This word denotes continuation, especially when it is used at the beginning of a chapter. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="pQRuKAJlDonWZe7uQYBGzPyH2ZE-H030jYTeXH3ooRncRbKpIKHOqeYDJyj9C--Un">SERVING THE LORD AS STEWARDS</h2><p data-content-id="vOVAPClIw9o-SMbO-M1lNlSn2shm1hmqQ-J4zvC1dCk_Dq1MQU0ZikmVpJu7Jramo"> In the preceding chapter the Lord spoke three parables concerning a sinner’s salvation. In this chapter He continues with one more parable, this one concerning the believer’s service. After a sinner becomes a believer, he needs to serve the Lord as a prudent steward. </p>
<p data-content-id="WVNqXX68ZMdi0Is0L3irJJmMw6vNnBJsEhQPV8kOVHacHdtLj25qcwOhqs0Rn3f7G"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69811" data-verses="Luke 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> the full salvation accomplished by the Divine Trinity is clearly presented. But after this presentation the Lord Jesus does not stop speaking. Instead, He goes on to give the Pharisees another parable. In this parable we do not see salvation; we see the prudence of a steward. This indicates that after we have been received into the house of God, we should become stewards. We were sinners, we have been saved, and we have become children of God. Now as children of God, as saved ones in the house of God, we should be stewards serving God in His house. This means that we should serve God in the church. <span class="pg" data-page-id="306" id="306">[306]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="AUNZZyVVAVOomKPrpRmiXVO12JhGBpIJR1Zd6ilPf-0XAUbPCWwsUR_yeQ_zGl6pN"> In the Gospel of Luke we see that whenever the Lord Jesus speaks of salvation, He goes on further to reveal something concerning the service. For instance, the parable of the good Samaritan in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69812" data-verses="Luke 10:1">chapter ten</span> portrays the Man-Savior’s saving grace in His human virtues expressing His divine attributes. Immediately after this parable, we have the case of Martha and Mary, a case that shows how we need to serve the Lord according to His desire and preference. The principle is the same in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69813" data-verses="Luke 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>. First the Lord speaks to us concerning an invitation extended by God to attend a great dinner. This signifies God’s salvation. Following this, we have the Lord’s teaching concerning following Him at the cost of renouncing all earthly things so that as good and faithful followers we may enter into the coming jubilee. This teaching is also related to service. Then after a full presentation of God’s full salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69814" data-verses="Luke 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>, the Lord gives us a parable in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69815" data-verses="Luke 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> showing us that after we have been saved we need to serve God in His house as stewards. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="FyPO0Bs_RXrorVGasatdDqLFgpUWneMjMpEk0aYSfanBP0SA21ajMTzZdZb6Sdt3F">TEACHING ABOUT THE PRUDENCE OF A STEWARD</h2><p data-content-id="Cx-Kq8f_kufcXTjbN_QhJ-18OaHzT6d8wbuRcXv4ortX3gIXqwulpXeobzCQdoJJ1"> The parable regarding the prudence of a steward is simple and brief. Nevertheless, this parable contains a puzzling point, and this is the Lord’s using an unrighteous steward to illustrate the service of a steward in God’s house. As we shall see, this does not mean that the Lord is teaching us to be unrighteous as we are serving. The important matter here is the steward’s prudence. </p>
<p data-content-id="PIjOD0qFuTXceUSZtD2ZDZcE0eeqSfaj3wRhOBw1FeXJDCmFaOPLe_ykOCcLaqUht"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69816" data-verses="Luke 16:1">Verse 1</span> says, “And He said also to the disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and this one was accused to him of squandering his possessions.” The steward here illustrates how the believers, saved by the love and grace of the Triune God, are the Lord’s stewards (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69817" data-verses="Luke 12:42">12:42</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69818" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:1-2">1 Cor. 4:1-2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69819" data-verses="1Peter 4:10">1 Pet. 4:10</span>), to whom He has committed His possessions. </p>
<p data-content-id="-L1fy_zrwSJXUU5n_uHTQQRsvBf8gL-7zbw6oEqqqLY7uMvSfrnIP_SgjrRC490ZA"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69820" data-verses="Luke 16:2-3">Verses 2 and 3</span> continue, “And he called him and said to him, What is this I hear concerning you? Render the account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward. And <span class="pg" data-page-id="307" id="307">[307]</span> the steward said within himself, What shall I do, because my lord is taking away the stewardship from me? I am not strong enough to dig. I am ashamed to beg.” Here the steward says he is not strong enough to dig as a farmer digging in the field, and he is ashamed to beg as a beggar begging for help. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69821" data-verses="Luke 16:4">verse 4</span> the steward said to himself, “I know what I will do, in order that when I am removed from the stewardship they may receive me into their own homes.” The receiving here signifies being received into the eternal tabernacles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69822" data-verses="Luke 16:9">v. 9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="pQRuKAJlDonWZe7uQYBG1cCH2ZE-H030jYTeXH3ooRncRbKpIKHOqeYDJyj9C--Un"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69823" data-verses="Luke 16:5-7">Verses 5 through 7</span> say, “And he called to him each one of his lord’s debtors and said to the first, How much do you owe my lord? And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your bill and sitting down quickly write fifty. Then to another he said, And you, how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He says to him, Take your bill and write eighty.” In these verses we see that the discharged steward, while he was still in the house, took the opportunity to do something for others in order that later they might do something for him. This was the steward’s prudence. </p>
<p data-content-id="vOVAPClIw9o-SMbO-M1lE2Sn2shm1hmqQ-J4zvC1dCk_Dq1MQU0ZikmVpJu7Jramo"> Concerning the prudence of the steward, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69824" data-verses="Luke 16:8">verse 8</span> says, “And the lord praised the unrighteous steward because he had acted prudently; for the sons of this age are more prudent than the sons of light in their own generation.” Literally, “the unrighteous steward” means “the steward of unrighteousness.” However, the praise here is not for the steward’s unrighteous act; it is for his prudence. </p>
<p data-content-id="WVNqXX68ZMdi0Is0L3irBa2Mw6vNnBJsEhQPV8kOVHacHdtLj25qcwOhqs0Rn3f7G"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69825" data-verses="Luke 16:8">verse 8</span> the Lord Jesus explains that the sons of this age are more prudent than the sons of light in their own generation. The sons of this age are the unsaved ones, the worldlings. The sons of light are the saved ones, the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69826" data-verses="John 12:36">John 12:36</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69827" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:5">1 Thes. 5:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69828" data-verses="Ephesians 5:8">Eph. 5:8</span>). The phrase “in their own generation” refers to dealings with the people of their generation. Here the Lord certainly is not teaching us to be unrighteous. Instead, He is teaching us to be prudent, that is, to do things at the right time, to take the opportunity at hand. <span class="pg" data-page-id="308" id="308">[308]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="f5f0VDzn9jkRQSn1MzFf_axwlK3eq6Siv45D3Z1PVOSaG41wTyIuG2c1MeKQAjvFj"> Mammon, that is, money, is of the satanic world. It is unrighteous in its position and existence. The steward in the parable exercised his prudence by his unrighteous act. The Lord teaches us, His believers, to exercise our prudence in the use of unrighteous mammon. </p>
<p data-content-id="IpVW-KDk2ZPgTnA3ZCjrS5l6ISFzZIDAsieA6ADySAHJiaJ_KT5O4yrRjpf5t_Bzi"> The phrase “the mammon of unrighteousness” indicates that money is not in the realm of God. Money is outside the kingdom of God; it is in the world of Satan. Therefore, money is unrighteous both in position and existence. Actually, as far as God is concerned, money should not exist. In this universe there should not be such a thing as money. If we love money, we love something that should not exist. </p>
<p data-content-id="HjWwmoGOlsak0TUDQCC_vcFVb6Y9pPEtBKlHqojq6TpIxbKDnyfW41Pa33wfqt__Y"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69830" data-verses="Luke 16:9">verse 9</span> the Lord says that if we make friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, when it fails we shall be received into eternal tabernacles. The word “fails” indicates that when the satanic world is over, mammon will be of no use in the kingdom of God. The eternal tabernacles are the eternal habitations into which the prudent believers will be received by those who share the benefit of their prudence. This will be in the coming kingdom age (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69831" data-verses="Luke 14:13-14">Luke 14:13-14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69832" data-verses="Matthew 10:42">Matt. 10:42</span>). </p>

This portion of the Gospel of Luke covers two matters: the teaching about the entrance into the kingdom of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69866" data-verses="Luke 16:14-18">vv. 14-18</span>) and a warning to the rich (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69867" data-verses="Luke 16:19-31">vv. 19-31</span>). </p>

The Lord spoke this word purposely to touch the Pharisees, and His word was an arrow penetrating them. </p>
<p data-content-id="aJBHB16Du0i39s63t8b4x1PcHmEpg--JpExe5woWN23707a7BR6E28G078JPrLzJy"> “Now the Pharisees, being lovers of money, heard all these things, and they were sneering at Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69869" data-verses="Luke 16:14">v. 14</span>). The Greek words translated “were sneering at” literally mean “were turning up the nose.” The Lord’s word penetrated the depths of their being. But instead of being convinced by it, they were stubborn. Because the Lord’s word touched them, they sneered at Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Gn7ewN6nSdByHJgqkSHgXVUOe-1UTJncAcUqo6emH0AAxLxRlyu8isObL6a-GDD-q"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69870" data-verses="Luke 16:15">verse 15</span> the Lord went on to say to the Pharisees, “You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts; for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.” The self-justification of the Pharisees was an exaltation of self in <span class="pg" data-page-id="318" id="318">[318]</span> pride. Hence, it was an abomination in the sight of God. Here the Lord was telling the Pharisees that they were altogether an abomination in the sight of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="crbZLnwlQe1t-R2NPH0jvKAIu5vZMDiBZWVp3fX5a8i7iFrksEzKqpk9CFqNeA0KZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69871" data-verses="Luke 16:16">verse 16</span> the Lord continued, “The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone forces his way into it.” The “law and the prophets” refer to the Old Testament. The words “until John” indicate the change of dispensation from law to gospel. This proves that the Old Testament dispensation was terminated by the coming of John. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y58zRdwVwZdOug4Ojt3YXyOi5YTN0tMwYIpE2xtAxeB5rWIwx_UI_h1Cxbmt9gLsn"> The Lord told the Pharisees that from the time of John “the good news of the kingdom of God is preached.” The Savior preached here the gospel of the kingdom of God to the Pharisees, the moneylovers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69872" data-verses="Luke 16:14">v. 14</span>). Money and sexual lust, incited by money, held them back from entering into the kingdom of God. Hence, the Savior’s preaching hit these two things purposely and strongly in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69873" data-verses="Luke 16:18-31">16:18-31</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="EnWCv_eiedBm6acXZTAA0ho36_MxGVx9OO_VMk3ydCyoMCmwj4AjjstBnWwxvP728"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69874" data-verses="Luke 16:16">verse 16</span> the Lord also spoke about forcing one’s way into the kingdom of God. For the Pharisees to force their way into the kingdom, they needed to humble themselves and divorce their money, not their wives, that is, to overcome money and the lust incited by money. </p>
<p data-content-id="DoAIPBJjBHkq_0FWY4zCgcupXz6H4o4mOlsgbBKk_d-ko1FGk9fqp5bptFLQcr1Cs"> Here the Lord Jesus seemed to be telling the Pharisees, “Don’t sneer at Me. The good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and you need to force your way into the kingdom. It is no longer the time of the law and the prophets. Now is the time of the jubilee of grace, and you need to force your way into it.” </p>
<p data-content-id="SlZ9LfzTj9oNzJ6-uay1I5W-FtUqhJ-Hu1E2vmyVDkctfWDUrJm1vTh_wbOlz4rGj"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69875" data-verses="Luke 16:17-18">verses 17 and 18</span> the Lord says to the Pharisees, “But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one serif of the law to fall. Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery; and he who marries one who has been divorced from a husband commits adultery.” A “serif” is a minute horn-like projection which distinguishes various Hebrew letters. Lest the Pharisees think that it was no longer necessary to keep the law since the law and the prophets were until John, the Lord told them that it was <span class="pg" data-page-id="319" id="319">[319]</span> easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for the slightest part of the law to fail. </p>
<p data-content-id="gIbolEPmx05b9aaM8IdXe8D6mLMAfdyt6RkK1EfHgPUcUpUKFw_EQp0WLDUU4a_bg"> When the Lord Jesus saw that the Pharisees were sneering at Him, He was not disappointed or discouraged. Neither would He stop speaking. Instead, the Lord went on to speak to them about being an abomination in the sight of God, about the kingdom of God, about keeping the law, and about divorce. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69876" data-verses="Luke 16:15-18">16:15-18</span> the Lord seems to be saying, “You Pharisees are sneering at Me. You justify yourselves in the sight of men, but in the sight of God you are an abomination. You need to realize that now is no longer the dispensation of the law, but the dispensation of the acceptable year of the Lord. Now is the time for the jubilee, the good news of the kingdom of God. In a sense, the law and the prophets are over.” </p>
<p data-content-id="eZHFLAbNWwOTr1-IpuiDpgNBlkr6ZBJMGzugC7yI_anSHrEw64TAXVbz6cBzraKtb"> When the Pharisees heard this, on the one hand they were unhappy. But, on the other hand, they were somewhat happy in that they may have thought that they no longer needed to keep the law. Now they were free to divorce their wives. Some of the rich Pharisees divorced their wives because they were indulging their lust. This lust was incited by their riches. Hence, the lust of the Pharisees to divorce their wives and marry another was incited by riches. </p>
<p data-content-id="5xKEgdpuEwfEMeypMUJXxQKMqK2Fa2tvJZgq5hBR6INjxpLJ7ifzk23cJPGz7OALQ"> A poor man is less likely to divorce his wife than a rich man. Today a large percentage of wealthy professional men have been divorced at least once, and a number have been divorced more than once. This is an indication that riches when used wrongly incite lust. This should warn us not to use riches to satisfy our lust. Instead, we should use our money for the benefit of others. </p>
<p data-content-id="NIP9vcQSpsaW9kg2xInrauOUIxlFrb3RZvwz6cWaDdxDBDLgKxxI62zDhQMwvPdhT"> As lovers of money, the Pharisees were incited by their riches to indulge their lust. When one was not satisfied with his wife, he could divorce her and get another one. Knowing their situation and realizing that, in a sense, they would be happy to hear that the law was over, the Lord seemed to tell them, “Don’t think that it is no longer necessary to keep the law. The law will never pass away; it remains to condemn you. You are not free from the law in order to divorce your <span class="pg" data-page-id="320" id="320">[320]</span> wives.” The Lord’s dealing with the Pharisees here actually touches their riches and their lust. His word deals with the matters of money and marriage. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69878" data-verses="Luke 16:19-31">16:19-31</span> He went on to tell them the story of the rich man and Lazarus. This story was directed at the rich Pharisees, as moneylovers who were incited by their riches to indulge their lust. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mixvss-j9tzRFTxyoeJ8FaxNaqOl6bARPohV1ILcl2Rfd6ZbvrtmR-ZjJ-Sa8BhLR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69879" data-verses="Luke 16:19">Luke 16:19</span> says, “Now a certain man was rich, and clothed himself in purple and fine linen, making merry splendidly every day.” This story is not a parable, because it mentions the names of Abraham, Lazarus, and Hades. It is a story used by the Savior as an illustrative answer to the money-loving and self-justifying Pharisees (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69880" data-verses="Luke 16:14-15">vv. 14-15</span>). Through this story the Lord warns them by unveiling that their miserable future will be like that of the rich man. Such a future will result from their rejection of the Savior’s gospel because of their love for money. </p>
<p data-content-id="VnpGtuJZc2t4WkT0Xa_TqKQs9FrNE0CWBPCyIGrj5PYt8QUzResVcYufIW_qbioEP"> In this story the rich man habitually clothed himself in purple and linen and made merry splendidly, sumptuously, every day. But a poor man named Lazarus “was cast at his gate, covered with sores, and longing to be satisfied with the things falling from the rich man’s table; and not only this, the dogs came and licked his sores” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69881" data-verses="Luke 16:20-21">vv. 20-21</span>). Then we are told that the poor man died and was carried away by angels into Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried. “In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments” and saw “Abraham far off, and Lazarus in his bosom” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69882" data-verses="Luke 16:23">v. 23</span>). The words “Abraham’s bosom” are a rabbinical phrase, equivalent to being with Abraham in Paradise (M. R. Vincent). Hades, like Sheol in the Old Testament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69883" data-verses="Genesis 37:35">Gen. 37:35</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69884" data-verses="Psalms 6:5">Psa. 6:5</span>), is the place where the souls and spirits of the dead are kept (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69885" data-verses="Acts 2:27">Acts 2:27</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="321" id="321">[321]</span> </p>

This chapter continues to speak of matters that took place as the Lord Jesus was on the way from Galilee to Jerusalem. Concerning this, the record in Luke comprises much more than the record in Matthew and Mark. In those Gospels the record concerning the Lord’s going from Galilee to Jerusalem is somewhat brief; Luke’s account of this, however, is much more inclusive. </p>

Regarding this last point, we need to realize that we are actually not very useful. This means that no matter how much we have done for the Lord, we need to consider ourselves unprofitable slaves. </p>

At first I could not see any connection between them and the record <span class="pg" data-page-id="326" id="326">[326]</span> in the previous chapter. Eventually, I saw that there is a connection, and this connection is that the four points in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69917" data-verses="Luke 17:1-10">17:1-10</span> are a teaching given by the Lord to the disciples because of what the Pharisees were doing. For instance, as religious hypocrites, the Pharisees often stumbled others. No one stumbles others more than a hypocritical religionist. Being false leaders in religion, the Pharisees were continually stumbling others. While they stumbled people on the one hand, they would not forgive them on the other hand. This means that even though they offended others, once they themselves were offended by someone, they would never forgive the one who offended them. Furthermore, these false leaders in religion did not have faith. If they had had faith, they would not have lived the way they did. Finally, the Pharisees were proud, viewing themselves as being very useful and profitable. </p>
<p data-content-id="uZQjh9ACdCObo73nDgKmaLwDnu18yBYq6-Sf_S2e8ePelXrhqcHNu9IrQr-mDbhX0"> From this we can see that the teaching in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69918" data-verses="Luke 17:1-10">17:1-10</span> was given by the Lord over against the background provided by the Pharisees. In these verses the Lord seems to be telling His disciples, “Don’t be like the Pharisees, stumbling others and yet not forgiving those who offend them. The Pharisees are without faith and yet are proud of themselves, thinking that they are useful.” </p>
<p data-content-id="f5f0VDzn9jkRQSn1Mwlf8aRwlK3eq6Siv45D3Z1PVOSaG41wTyIuG2c1MeKQAjvFj"> As those who are enjoying the Lord in the New Testament jubilee, we should not stumble others. On the contrary, we should do our best to perfect, protect, and preserve others. Second, if we are offended by someone, we should always be ready and willing to forgive. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69919" data-verses="Luke 17:3-4">Luke 17:3 and 4</span> say, “If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. And if he sins against you seven times a day, and turns to you seven times, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him.” Here the Lord emphasizes the need to be willing to forgive. Furthermore, in any kind of circumstance or environment, we need to exercise our faith, believing in God and trusting Him for everything. Moreover, although we may be somewhat useful and profitable, we should humble ourselves and not think of ourselves as being useful. On the contrary, we should always consider that we are unprofitable slaves. <span class="pg" data-page-id="327" id="327">[327]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69921" data-verses="Luke 17:7-9">verses 7 through 9</span> He says, “Now which of you, having a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come immediately and recline at the table? But will he not rather say to him, Prepare something that I may dine, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink; and after this you shall eat and drink? Does he thank the slave because he did the things which were directed?” This indicates that the slave, after plowing or tending sheep, should not expect to be highly praised for his work. It is still necessary for him to go to the kitchen, prepare food for his master, and serve him so that he may be satisfied. After all this, the slave should realize that he is unprofitable. Therefore, the Lord concludes, “So also you, when you do all the things which you are directed, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="69922" data-verses="Luke 17:10">v. 10</span>). I appreciate the point the Lord makes in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69923" data-verses="Luke 17:7-10">17:7-10</span>, for it strengthens us in our service. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IONTFFycrPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW">The Seriousness of Offending Others</h2><p data-content-id="kAQNthUaZvalgvsKEtTCdAMJbCrdyQWj0UWwMbQUlst1TdatH57vU3-PT1x1LNEeo"> In the church life, the church service, and the Lord’s ministry it is a very serious thing to offend others. Sometimes it seems that we can accomplish a great deal. Nevertheless, we may tear down more than we build up. This is the result of stumbling others. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jgkr79uXp4nHSqPJxFYf2N8wm7qGnaecC8bfNtJTx_m3Ubj0zJ3n8sOq8U2GgJfUN"> When I was young I was given the following admonition: “Don’t do the Lord’s work in such a way that you build up one foot and then tear down a foot and a half.” According to this admonition, it is possible for us first to build up and then to tear down more than what we have built up. This is what some who are serving the Lord are doing. On the one hand, they have done much for the Lord; on the other hand, simultaneously they have torn down a great deal, even more than they have built up. We need to learn from this not to stumble others and thereby tear down what has been built up. We always need to be careful and cautious not to hurt others, not to offend others, and not to stumble others. <span class="pg" data-page-id="328" id="328">[328]</span> </p>

Then we shall not have problems with others. However, on the one hand, some servants of the Lord stumble others, and, on the other hand, are easily offended by others. Therefore, they are always having problems with people. Either they stumble others, or they are offended by others. We should try not to stumble others, but always be ready and willing to forgive anyone who may offend us. </p>
<p data-content-id="baXaoDjM31g4vdogJMo_AmJsY6kl2rRDOpin976WeiNY5gEGyluhr_T3XIAmn92Sv"> Do you know what it means to forgive? To forgive means not to be offended. According to the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="69924" data-verses="Luke 17:4">17:4</span>, even if a brother sins against us seven times a day, we should always be ready to forgive him. As soon as we forgive someone, we shall not be offended by him. But if we do not forgive, we shall be offended. The point here is that forgiving annuls offending. If we do not forgive others, we shall be offended by them. But if we forgive them, we shall annul the offense. </p>
<p data-content-id="qMcyXCf9JxgO6C4J_VfI19utWR45eDmy97SasR1HjYltLhBmhnwtFer_oxArsFU1X"> Suppose a certain brother offends you, and you forgive him. Your forgiving of him will annul his offending of you. Then there will be no problem between you. However, suppose this brother offends you, and you are not willing to forgive him and forget the offense. This will cause trouble, especially to you, for you will become entangled as the result of being offended. Hence, we should avoid stumbling others, and we should also avoid being offended by others. We should always be careful and cautious not to offend others. At the same time, we should always be willing to forgive others. </p>

Furthermore, they did not know until the flood came and took them away. It will be the same in the days of the Son of Man. People will be stupefied by the necessities of this life, not knowing that God’s judgment (signified by the flood) will come upon them by the Lord’s coming. The believers, however, should be dedrugged and soberly know that the Lord is coming to execute God’s judgment upon this corrupted world. </p>

Now we can be released from the bondage of sin, Satan, the world, the self, and the old creation. We need to see that it was necessary for Christ to die to set us free from this bondage.

On the contrary, this understanding is in accord with the revelation given in the New Testament, especially that in Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation.

<p data-content-id="_ZwqsA5v5sK5Gd_CEsEVx8U-oyUvJZvrd4_dLBztnh2YyrGo-ZQKJ0rrkSkFZAXKk"> In this parable the Lord indicates that the believers in Christ have an opponent.

We ought to pray persistently for this avenging (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70033" data-verses="Revelation 6:9-10">Rev. 6:9-10</span>) and not lose heart. </p>

Following this, the Lord went on to say, “Hear what the unrighteous judge says; and God, shall He not by all means carry out the avenging of His chosen ones, who cry to Him day and night; and yet He is longsuffering over them? I tell you that He will carry out their avenging quickly.

During the course of His teaching given on this journey, the Lord covers many aspects of matters related to the jubilee, to the kingdom of God, and to Himself as our enjoyment. He speaks regarding His death, His resurrection, God’s salvation, the coming reward, the kingdom age, the evil generation, and the condition of the Pharisees. All these matters are related either directly or indirectly to the kingdom of God and to the enjoyment of Christ. </p>

They have no thought concerning God being their enjoyment, for they all have been drugged, stupefied.

They needed to realize that the most distracting thing is this present generation with all its components. The components of the evil generation stupefy the worldly people. </p>

What is covered in these verses may be considered the condition and requirements for entering into the kingdom of God. Here the Lord mentions three steps: first, to humble oneself before God as a sinner, realizing the need of God’s propitiation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70055" data-verses="Luke 18:9-14">vv. 9-14</span>); second, to be like a little child, without any preoccupying concept (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70056" data-verses="Luke 18:15-17">vv. 15-17</span>); and third, to follow the Savior by overcoming being occupied by riches and all other material matters (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70057" data-verses="Luke 18:18-30">vv. 18-30</span>). Let us consider each of these aspects of the Lord’s teaching. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="TNosbqa7UDYgYcvAGJc1pbJ_AhIjoMFZ1RknVLQVa51Kalz7wwEWcHnDTjWi7J3AL">HUMBLING ONESELF</h2><p data-content-id="nV3M-hxr_PahH5f0AOHBGeLmHTm7hkZMtOU1wXRdLUKzbd2Rwvo4ANlkJXwIqXfdH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70058" data-verses="Luke 18:9-14">18:9-14</span> we see that in order to enter into the kingdom of God, we need to humble ourselves. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70059" data-verses="Luke 18:14">verse 14</span> the Lord says, “Everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted.” We should not think that we are somebody. Instead, we should humble ourselves and regard ourselves as nobody and nothing. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="6v5bqSZVkxM1HMGlUPxeF7W8O5Ww8o25b4qVQMP5MlzkvkTR8-sJeZYdiAzVYImAy">The Prayer of the Pharisee</h2><p data-content-id="10Y2CNEKWaUAkDvQzk8a_1rffZ6_98e4N8ozCPPMzkmQPd2gHT1E_ldnAuur5g5vG"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70060" data-verses="Luke 18:10-14">verses 10 through 14</span> the Lord tells a parable of two men who “went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax collector” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70061" data-verses="Luke 18:10">v. 10</span>). The Lord often used tax <span class="pg" data-page-id="354" id="354">[354]</span> collectors and Pharisees as examples. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70062" data-verses="Luke 18:11-12">Verses 11 and 12</span> record the Pharisee’s prayer: “The Pharisee stood and prayed these things to himself: God, I thank You that I am not like the rest of men—extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all, whatever I get.” The Pharisee’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70063" data-verses="Luke 18:11">verse 11</span>, where he thanks God that he is not like the rest of men, does not sound like a prayer at all; instead, it sounds like an accusation of others. Likewise, his word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70064" data-verses="Luke 18:12">verse 12</span> about fasting and paying tithes does not sound like a prayer, but rather like an arrogant boast to God. Therefore, in his prayer the Pharisee was accusing others and boasting to God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="9ja0oN4pSUA1PfKrQQ8CVw284jNQuXvNrAFRd3n77So0-KjQ2N1zKueNosjiAaC8D">The Prayer of the Tax Collector</h2><p data-content-id="jXdlQ8xxZMxS77oeE-8s32PSEOMlQ9s1jH8YQMk7cEhKguIbR9jLLFm6wFfxpAM7f"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70065" data-verses="Luke 18:13">verse 13</span> we see that the despised, accused, and condemned tax collector prayed in the way of humbling himself to the uttermost: “But the tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!” This word implies the need of a Redeemer and also the need of propitiation. The tax collector realized how his sinfulness offended God. Hence, he asked God to be propitiated, to be appeased toward him by a propitiation, so that God may be merciful and gracious to him. </p>
<p data-content-id="TNosbqa7UDYgYcvAGJc1vJZ_AhIjoMFZ1RknVLQVa51Kalz7wwEWcHnDTjWi7J3AL"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70066" data-verses="Romans 3:25">Romans 3:25</span> says that God set forth Christ Jesus as a propitiation-cover through faith in His blood. The Greek word for propitiation is <em>hilasterion,</em> different from <em>hilasmos</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70067" data-verses="1John 2:2">1 John 2:2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70068" data-verses="1John 4:10">4:10</span> and <em>hilaskomai</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70069" data-verses="Hebrews 2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span>. <em>Hilasmos</em> is that which propitiates, that is, a propitiatory sacrifice. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70070" data-verses="1John 2:2">1 John 2:2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70071" data-verses="1John 4:10">4:10</span> the Lord Jesus is the propitiatory sacrifice for our sins. The Lord offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70072" data-verses="Hebrews 9:28">Heb. 9:28</span>), not only for our redemption but also for God’s satisfaction. In Him as our Substitute, through His vicarious death, God is satisfied and appeased. Hence, He is the propitiation between God and us. </p>
<p data-content-id="nV3M-hxr_PahH5f0AOHBPNrmHTm7hkZMtOU1wXRdLUKzbd2Rwvo4ANlkJXwIqXfdH"> <em>Hilaskomai</em> means to appease, to reconcile one by satisfying the other’s demand, that is, to propitiate. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70073" data-verses="Hebrews 2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="355" id="355">[355]</span> the Lord Jesus made propitiation for our sins to reconcile us to God by satisfying God’s righteous demands on us. The Lord Jesus made propitiation for our sins to appease God’s righteousness, to reconcile us by satisfying the demand of God’s righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="6v5bqSZVkxM1HMGlUPxeNom8O5Ww8o25b4qVQMP5MlzkvkTR8-sJeZYdiAzVYImAy"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70074" data-verses="Romans 3:25">Romans 3:25</span> <em>hilasterion</em> is the place of propitiation. So in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70075" data-verses="Hebrews 9:5">Hebrews 9:5</span> this word is used for the lid of the ark within the Holy of Holies, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70076" data-verses="Exodus 25:16-22">Exodus 25:16-22</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70077" data-verses="Leviticus 16:12-16">Leviticus 16:12-16</span> the Septuagint also uses this word for the cover of the ark. The law of the Ten Commandments was in the ark, exposing and condemning by its righteous requirement the sin of the people who came to contact God. By the lid of the ark with the atoning blood sprinkled upon it on the day of atonement, the whole situation on the sinner’s side was fully covered. Therefore, it was upon this lid that God could meet with people who broke His righteous law without, governmentally, any contradiction to His righteousness, even under the observing of the cherubim that bore His glory overshadowing the lid of the ark. The propitiatory or expiatory sacrifice, which foreshadowed Christ, satisfied all the requirements of God’s righteousness and glory. This is what <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70078" data-verses="Romans 3:25">Romans 3:25</span> refers to. Thus, the word <em>hilasterion</em> is used to reveal that the Lord Jesus is the propitiation place, the propitiation-cover. As the propitiatory sacrifice, He has made full propitiation on the cross for our sins and has fully satisfied the requirements of God’s righteousness and glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="RZzGEogxd1MGIsl2cZJkp3iHSdLcm5J3IdyqcTX_a5S28-G-Yz8OH2qUTV12ioiQD"> It is significant, therefore, that the tax collector in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70079" data-verses="Luke 18:13">Luke 18:13</span> said, “God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!” He realized that he had offended God and that he needed someone to be his offering of propitiation so that God would be appeased. This humble person realized that he was nothing but a sinner. Because he offered up a prayer that was based upon God’s propitiation, he “went down to his house justified” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70080" data-verses="Luke 18:14">v. 14</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="sd53dK7V3RACxeAhZZ5arJvJWY7CXd4lKCZrOk5KHHUk8v9DyXsEuqfotQsdDEpDq">Humbled and Subdued</h2><p data-content-id="whXJpCNVhaMbONnpMpFlLHbV78Gr88OYrW5ZYazISocRSVFEj93Rh6WuKCXo2tcws"> The Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70081" data-verses="Luke 18:14">verse 14</span> about being justified refers to the initial stage of our salvation. Every saved person <span class="pg" data-page-id="356" id="356">[356]</span> should be one who humbles himself to the same extent the tax collector did. Actually, to repent and confess our sins is to humble ourselves. All saved ones are those who have been humbled and subdued. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lj54LQasZ-K8EIg0L9gBikZk1nfFprp5qpL9M39N7uxjTamFkVxVWNhxhdjVx7yWi"> When I was young, I was proud and arrogant, never willing to admit that I was wrong. But one day the Spirit caught me, and I was convinced, humbled, and subdued. It seemed to me that no one was as sinful as I was. My attitude was the exact opposite of what it had been before. I can testify from experience that a saved person is a humble, subdued person. We need to humble ourselves to such an extent that we consider ourselves nobody and nothing. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70083" data-verses="Luke 18:16-17">verses 16 and 17</span> the Lord Jesus says, “Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God. Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child shall by no means enter into it.” A little child, not filled with and occupied by old concepts, can easily receive a new thought. Hence, people need to receive the kingdom of God as a new thing, with an unoccupied heart, like a little child. </p>
<p data-content-id="AUNZZyVVAVOomKPruQWiUVu12JhGBpIJR1Zd6ilPf-0XAUbPCWwsUR_yeQ_zGl6pN"> We were all born into the kingdom of man, and we are all in the kingdom of man. In order to go from the kingdom of man into the kingdom of God, to be transferred out of the kingdom of man into the kingdom of God, we need to accept some new thoughts. Who is able to receive these new thoughts? Only those who are babes, those without preoccupations, can receive them. However, many saved ones do not want to be like babes. Instead, they like to regard themselves as intelligent and knowledgeable, thinking that they know everything. Those who have this attitude are through as far as entering into the kingdom of God is concerned. Although they are saved, it will be difficult for them to enter into the enjoyment of the jubilee. A requirement for entering into the kingdom of God is that we become like little children. <span class="pg" data-page-id="357" id="357">[357]</span> </p>

According to the Gospel of John, to have eternal life is to be saved with God’s uncreated life so that we may live by this life today and for eternity. But to inherit eternal life is to share in the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age. The certain ruler in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70086" data-verses="Luke 18:18">18:18</span> apparently was seeking eternal life in the coming age. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70111" data-verses="Luke 18:31">18:31</span> He took the twelve aside in order to speak a private word to them.

<p data-content-id="PIjOD0qFuTXceUSZqC2ZLLME0eeqSfaj3wRhOBw1FeXJDCmFaOPLe_ykOCcLaqUht"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70112" data-verses="Luke 18:31-33">verses 31 through 33</span> this word is recorded in some detail: “Behold we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things will be accomplished which have been written through the prophets regarding the Son of Man. For He will be delivered up to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and outrageously treated and spit upon; and when they have scourged Him, they will kill Him; and on the third day He will rise.” It is significant that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70113" data-verses="Luke 18:31">verse 31</span> the Lord does not say, “Behold I am going up to Jerusalem”; instead, He says, “Behold we are going up to Jerusalem.” </p>
<p data-content-id="_ZwqsA5v5sK5Gd_CEskVx-U-oyUvJZvrd4_dLBztnh2YyrGo-ZQKJ0rrkSkFZAXKk"> This was the third time the Lord Jesus revealed His <span class="pg" data-page-id="362" id="362">[362]</span> death to the disciples. The first was in Caesarea Philippi, before His transfiguration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70114" data-verses="Luke 9:22">9:22</span>). The second was in Galilee, after His transfiguration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70115" data-verses="Luke 9:44-45">9:44-45</span>). This time, the third time, was on the way to Jerusalem.

<p data-content-id="B-xax8NKp7LCijI7TugMm8Jos3kSlmvYlicWUqjousBPGePPVlOH7nulgHhpJQvmR"> We have seen that the Man-Savior had predicted His death and resurrection twice already.

This was His obedience to God unto death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70116" data-verses="Philippians 2:8">Phil. 2:8</span>), according to the counsel of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70117" data-verses="Acts 2:23">Acts 2:23</span>), for the fulfillment of His redemptive plan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70118" data-verses="Isaiah 53:10">Isa. 53:10</span>). He knew that through His death He would be glorified in resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70119" data-verses="Luke 24:25-26">Luke 24:25-26</span>) and that His divine life would be released to produce many brothers for His expression (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70120" data-verses="John 12:23-24">John 12:23-24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70121" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Rom. 8:29</span>). For the joy set before Him, He despised the shame (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70122" data-verses="Hebrews 12:2">Heb. 12:2</span>) and volunteered to be delivered to the Satan-usurped leaders of the Jews and condemned by them to death.

The disciples were not able to appreciate the “music” “played” to them by the Lord. They did not understand anything the Lord said. Although He used simple words, they could not comprehend what He was saying. </p>

Therefore, following the third unveiling of the Lord’s death and resurrection, we have the case of the healing of a blind man. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70130" data-verses="Luke 10:1">chapter ten</span> the Lord was received into Martha’s home, and her home was in Bethany. In His journey from Galilee to Jerusalem the Lord would have come to Jericho before He reached Bethany, and then He would have gone from Bethany to Jerusalem. Why, then, is Bethany implied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70131" data-verses="Luke 10:1">chapter ten</span> and Jericho clearly mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70132" data-verses="Luke 19:1">chapter nineteen</span>? Does this mean that He came to Bethany and then went back to Jericho? No, actually He was received by Martha after He passed through Jericho. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70133" data-verses="Luke 10:1">chapter ten</span> Luke is not concerned with geography or historical sequence; he is concerned with the high standard of morality. This is a strong evidence to show that Luke’s narration is not according to the sequence of historical events but according to morality. </p>

The following verses indicate that near Jericho the Man-Savior healed a blind man. This means that He healed the blind man before He entered Jericho. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70135" data-verses="Matthew 20:29">Matthew 20:29</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70136" data-verses="Mark 10:46">Mark 10:46</span> say that the healing occurred at His coming out from Jericho. Luke’s narrative has a spiritual bearing. The blind man’s receiving of sight was followed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70137" data-verses="Luke 19:1-9">19:1-9</span> by the salvation of Zaccheus. <span class="pg" data-page-id="364" id="364">[364]</span> This indicates that to receive salvation first requires sight to see the Savior. These two cases, occurring at Jericho in direct continuation, should be considered spiritually as one complete case. A sinner in darkness needs to receive sight so that he may realize his need of salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70138" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="ov0pwXq8uOJOycOiB0qN9cWIpYzHGrTUx1Dbcc3jku5CrgeFN6HqgZR5btlLER604"> What is covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70139" data-verses="Luke 18:35">18:35—19:10</span> shows how one can fulfill the conditions, as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70140" data-verses="Luke 18:9-30">18:9-30</span>, for entering the kingdom of God. These conditions are first to receive sight from the Savior (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70141" data-verses="Luke 18:35-43">18:35-43</span>) and then to receive the Savior as the dynamic salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70142" data-verses="Luke 19:1-10">19:1-10</span>). Thus, the blind man could be like the repenting tax collector and the unoccupied little child to receive the Savior, and Zaccheus could renounce all his riches to follow Him. </p>

The title “Son of David” is the royal title of Christ for the children of Israel. Only the children of Israel were privileged to address the Lord with this title. </p>

And when he drew near, He questioned him, What do you want Me to do for you? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight!” The Lord’s question in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70145" data-verses="Luke 18:41">verse 41</span> shows open love toward this needy one. It expressed the Man-Savior’s humanity to an unimaginable extent. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y58zRdwVwZdOug4OksnYUzui5YTN0tMwYIpE2xtAxeB5rWIwx_UI_h1Cxbmt9gLsn"> The Lord then said to the blind man, “Receive your sight; your faith has healed you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70146" data-verses="Luke 18:42">v. 42</span>). Literally, the Greek word translated “healed” means saved. Instantly the man received his sight and followed the Lord, glorifying God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70147" data-verses="Luke 18:43">v. 43</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="EnWCv_eiedBm6acXeSQA3gI36_MxGVx9OO_VMk3ydCyoMCmwj4AjjstBnWwxvP728"> After the Lord unveiled His death and resurrection to the twelve for the third time, they were still blind. Hence, they were represented by the blind man near Jericho. The Lord’s healing of the blind man signifies His dealing with the blindness of the twelve disciples. </p>
<p data-content-id="DoAIPBJjBHkq_0FWf5jCjcOpXz6H4o4mOlsgbBKk_d-ko1FGk9fqp5bptFLQcr1Cs"> Here I would like to say, once again, that it is not an easy matter to understand the Bible. In understanding the <span class="pg" data-page-id="365" id="365">[365]</span> Scriptures it is not sufficient to know the letters in black and white. If we would understand the Bible, we need to know the spirit of the particular book we are reading. The burden in Luke’s spirit in this part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70148" data-verses="Luke 18:1">chapter eighteen</span> was to show us that all the Lord’s followers, even His twelve chosen ones, were blind. The Pharisees were not the only ones who were not able to see the spiritual reality of the kingdom of God. We may say that the twelve were foremost in lacking this ability. Three of them—Peter, James, and John—were with the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration. Although they saw so much on the mountain, actually, in a spiritual sense, they did not see anything at all, for they were blind. Therefore, the man near Jericho was not the only one who was blind. All those around the Lord also were blind. </p>

This portion of Luke covers two matters: the saving of Zaccheus in Jericho (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70175" data-verses="Luke 19:1-10">vv. 1-10</span>) and the Lord’s teaching about faithfulness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70176" data-verses="Luke 19:11-27">vv. 11-27</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IOKR1F6PbPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70177" data-verses="Luke 19:1-2">Luke 19:1 and 2</span> say, “And He entered and was passing through Jericho. And behold, there was a man whose name was called Zaccheus; and he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.” As a chief tax collector, Zaccheus was a chief sinner, a leading sinner. He became rich through his sinfulness as a tax collector. </p>
<p data-content-id="whXJpCNVhaMbONnpMpllLFbV78Gr88OYrW5ZYazISocRSVFEj93Rh6WuKCXo2tcws"> In his confession to the Lord related to restitution and clearing of the past, Zaccheus said to Him, “Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusations, I restore four times as much” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70178" data-verses="Luke 19:8">v. 8</span>). We may regard the words “if I have taken anything” as a euphemism, a nice way of referring to extortion. Tax collectors put a higher value on property or increased the tax of those unable to pay and then charged high interest. This was the way they extorted others. As Zaccheus was seeking to make restitution, he referred to his extortion. What Zaccheus did in restoring four times the amount he <span class="pg" data-page-id="370" id="370">[370]</span> extorted was very honest. Nevertheless, he still referred to his acts of extortion in a euphemistic way. A man who had become rich by being sinful, Zaccheus now wanted to make full restitution in order to clear up his sinful past. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Lj54LQasZ-K8EIg0L9ABimZk1nfFprp5qpL9M39N7uxjTamFkVxVWNhxhdjVx7yWi">Seeking to See Jesus</h2><p data-content-id="mFzvXUhbhqpISr0cbCNguil1AZG80kf7bH6haSXLEJRmHfrjBcKo82-9Gg2bAZ_94"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70179" data-verses="Luke 19:3-4">Luke 19:3 and 4</span> say, “And he was seeking to see Jesus, who He is; and he could not because of the crowd, for he was small in stature. And he ran on ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree that he might see Him, for He was about to pass through that way.” Although Zaccheus climbed up in the tree to see the Lord Jesus, we are told not that he saw the Lord but that the Lord saw him: “And as He came to the place, Jesus looked up and said to him, Zaccheus, hurry and come down; for today I must stay in your house” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70180" data-verses="Luke 19:5">v. 5</span>). The seeing was not on Zaccheus’ side; it was on the Savior’s side. Once again we see the Man-Savior’s high standard of morality in saving sinners. Nothing was done by the sinner; rather, everything was done by the Savior, even the seeing. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70181" data-verses="Luke 19:6">verse 6</span> we are told that Zaccheus “hurried and came down, and welcomed Him, rejoicing.” </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ZOnBpaevoPlkI92KLLWpCtDTUxvcifQzDL7AE4fhd-GIrB27yf8bZOWtB76IdtGDS">The Man-Savior Staying in Zaccheus’ House</h2><p data-content-id="AUNZZyVVAVOomKPruQ2iXUO12JhGBpIJR1Zd6ilPf-0XAUbPCWwsUR_yeQ_zGl6pN"> Zaccheus certainly was an isolated person. He was despised to the uttermost by the Jewish community and was even more isolated than a leper. Especially the Pharisees, the high ranking hypocrites in the Jewish religion, did not care for him. In their sight he was more unclean than someone with leprosy. Nevertheless, in front of a large crowd the Savior told Zaccheus, “Today I must stay in your house.” What a great surprise that was to Zaccheus and to everyone in the crowd! The entire city of Jericho must have been shaken by it. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70182" data-verses="Luke 19:7">Verse 7</span> says, “And seeing it, they all grumbled, saying, He has gone in to lodge with a sinful man.” </p>

Zaccheus, however, responded in a very strong way, recognizing the Savior as his Lord. “And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70184" data-verses="Luke 19:8">v. 8</span>). Zaccheus could utter such a word even though he had not heard the Man-Savior’s teaching concerning material possessions. </p>
<p data-content-id="PIjOD0qFuTXceUSZqCmZDYcE0eeqSfaj3wRhOBw1FeXJDCmFaOPLe_ykOCcLaqUht"> On the way from Galilee to Jerusalem, the Savior spoke about material possessions a number of times. The first was in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70185" data-verses="Luke 12:1">chapter twelve</span>. When someone out of the crowd asked Him to tell his brother to divide the inheritance, He said to them, “Take heed and guard yourselves from all covetousness; for no one’s life is in the abundance of his possessions” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70186" data-verses="Luke 12:15">12:15</span>). Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70187" data-verses="Luke 14:33">14:33</span> the Savior went on to say, “Everyone of you who does not renounce all his own possessions cannot be My disciple.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70188" data-verses="Luke 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> He spoke to His disciples concerning the mammon of unrighteousness and then issued a warning to the rich. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70189" data-verses="Luke 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> He spoke about material possessions in relation to the rapture of the overcomers: “In that day, he who shall be on the housetop and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away; and he who is in the field, likewise, let him not turn back to the things behind” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70190" data-verses="Luke 17:31">v. 31</span>). Following this, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70191" data-verses="Luke 18:22">18:22</span> He said to the rich ruler, “All things, whatever you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me.” From all these instances we see that the Man-Savior spoke repeatedly concerning material possessions. Zaccheus, of course, did not hear any of this. Nevertheless, in responding to the Savior’s word, he said that half of his possessions he gives to the poor. </p>
<p data-content-id="-L1fy_zrwSJXUU5n4vXTQTRsvBf8gL-7zbw6oEqqqLY7uMvSfrnIP_SgjrRC490ZA"> We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70192" data-verses="Luke 19:8">verse 8</span> Zaccheus went on to say to the Lord, “If I have taken anything from anyone by false accusations, I restore four times as much.” What Zaccheus did here was according to the requirements of the law for restoration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70193" data-verses="Exodus 22:1">Exo. 22:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70194" data-verses="2Samuel 12:6">2 Sam. 12:6</span>). This was the spontaneous issue of the dynamic power of the Lord’s salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="pQRuKAJlDonWZe7uXZRG1fCH2ZE-H030jYTeXH3ooRncRbKpIKHOqeYDJyj9C--Un"> In the case of the saving of Zaccheus in Jericho, we see that the Lord’s salvation is actually the Lord Himself. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70195" data-verses="Luke 19:5">verse 5</span> He says, “Today I must stay in your house.” But in <span class="pg" data-page-id="372" id="372">[372]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70196" data-verses="Luke 19:9">verse 9</span> He says to Zaccheus, “Today salvation has come to this house.” When we put these verses together, we see that “I” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70197" data-verses="Luke 19:5">verse 5</span> is equal to “salvation” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70198" data-verses="Luke 19:9">verse 9</span>. This indicates that salvation is actually the Lord Himself. When He comes, salvation comes. Wherever He stays, there salvation stays. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="vOVAPClIw9o-SMbO5NllH3yn2shm1hmqQ-J4zvC1dCk_Dq1MQU0ZikmVpJu7Jramo">A Captive under Oppression</h2><p data-content-id="WVNqXX68ZMdi0Is0M2yrCbWMw6vNnBJsEhQPV8kOVHacHdtLj25qcwOhqs0Rn3f7G"> We have pointed out that Zaccheus responded to the Man-Savior in the way he did because of the dynamic power of His salvation. With the Man-Savior there is dynamic power, and this power is the Holy Spirit. He ministered the jubilee by the Holy Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70199" data-verses="Luke 4:1">chapter four</span> He declared that the Spirit of the Lord was upon Him because He had been anointed to proclaim release to the captives. The Lord had been appointed and anointed to proclaim the jubilee to all those who were oppressed. </p>
<p data-content-id="2tNCATtNEU-uXYvQvNg4ll3qLxK2yI2K223oVb_0w5iwpZu36YT9EiPenSev2WCos"> In the sight of the religious people, especially the Pharisees, Zaccheus was a leading sinner, for he was a chief tax collector. But in the sight of the Man-Savior he was a captive under oppression. Before he climbed up the tree to see the Savior, Zaccheus may have given much consideration to how to be released from his sinful condition. As a Jew, he must have been condemned in his conscience for working as a tax collector to gather taxes for the Roman imperialists. Hence, he was condemned by his own conscience as a traitor to his country. Therefore, he may have tried to get out of his sinful condition, but he was unable to do so, for he was a captive and was oppressed. </p>

The Savior came to Jericho purposely to seek and to save such a lost one. </p>
<p data-content-id="IpVW-KDk2ZPgTnA3eDzrS4l6ISFzZIDAsieA6ADySAHJiaJ_KT5O4yrRjpf5t_Bzi"> The Lord’s seeking Zaccheus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70201" data-verses="Luke 19:1">Luke 19</span> may be compared to His seeking the Samaritan woman in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70202" data-verses="John 4:1">John 4</span>. The Savior told Zaccheus, “I must stay in your house,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70203" data-verses="John 4:4">John 4:4</span> says of Him, “He had to pass through Samaria.” It was <span class="pg" data-page-id="373" id="373">[373]</span> necessary for Him to go through Samaria in order to meet a lost Samaritan woman. The Lord went there to seek her and save her. The same kind of thing happened in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70204" data-verses="Luke 19:1">Luke 19</span>. The Lord had to stay in Zaccheus’ house in order to save this lost person. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="HjWwmoGOlsak0TUDXDS_vdFVb6Y9pPEtBKlHqojq6TpIxbKDnyfW41Pa33wfqt__Y">Salvation, the Jubilee,<br/>and the Kingdom</h2><p data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IOKR1FxcLPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70205" data-verses="Luke 19:1-10">19:1-10</span> we see that wherever the Man-Savior is there salvation is also, for He Himself is salvation. Furthermore, when this salvation is present, the kingdom of God is also present, and the kingdom of God is the jubilee. Therefore, when the Lord came into the house of Zaccheus, that was a jubilee not only for an individual but for the entire household. When the Lord came into his house, salvation came to that house. </p>

Now we come to the fourth section of this Gospel—the Man-Savior’s presentation of Himself to death for redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70255" data-verses="Luke 19:28">19:28—22:46</span>). After the Savior finished His ministry in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70256" data-verses="Luke 19:27">19:27</span>, the time came for Him to go up to Jerusalem to present Himself to the death ordained by God for the accomplishment of eternal redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="8rK9hZU17CqFQv_7e_8MYGzV076l38frJWrb3fYskUnsCbvB8WxSNVgXi8Bko75qT"> The Lord’s transfiguration on the mountaintop took place toward the end of His ministry in Galilee. The purpose of that transfiguration as reported in the Gospel of Luke was to show the disciples that for the enjoyment of the jubilee there is the need of transformation signified by transfiguration. After completing His ministry in Galilee, the Man-Savior began to make the long journey from Galilee to Jerusalem. </p>

In those talks certain main things were covered. First, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="380" id="380">[380]</span> Lord showed the disciples how to receive God’s salvation. Then He revealed to them how to serve God. To receive God’s salvation is to enjoy His jubilee today in the age of grace. Serving God qualifies us to enter into the coming kingdom to enjoy the jubilee in the next age. At least five times in the Gospel of Luke the Lord speaks concerning how to follow Him and serve Him so that we may be qualified to enter into the coming kingdom and enjoy the jubilee in the next age. He speaks of this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70257" data-verses="Luke 14:1">chapters fourteen</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70258" data-verses="Luke 16:1">sixteen</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70259" data-verses="Luke 17:1">seventeen</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70260" data-verses="Luke 18:1">eighteen</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70261" data-verses="Luke 19:1">nineteen</span>, where He gives the parable of the servants who received gifts with which to serve Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70262" data-verses="Luke 19:11-27">19:11-27</span>). As servants who have received gifts from the Lord, we need to make a profit for Him so that we may be qualified to inherit the earth and rule over it as kings. Participating in the coming jubilee in the millennium, therefore, will be a reward to the overcoming saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="O6A_Zpet8NpkAD12yyXVI9X96Jkgmribh2Ghh9n9QaeX9vJyetjJM0RwCL0BYvdJK"> The Man-Savior’s ministry was carried out first in Galilee. It began with His proclaiming the jubilee of grace, and it continued until His transfiguration. The Lord’s transfiguration signifies that all His followers need to be transformed in order to share in the enjoyment of the jubilee. After completing His ministry in Galilee, the Lord left Galilee for Jerusalem. On the way from Galilee to Jerusalem, He repeatedly taught His disciples and followers how to take God’s salvation, that is, how to receive the kingdom of God, which is actually the Man-Savior Himself, in order to enter into the enjoyment of the jubilee today. The Lord also taught them that to follow Him and serve Him, we need to renounce material things. We must overcome all distractions and frustrations so that we may love Him to the uttermost and serve Him faithfully. Then we shall be qualified to enter into the kingdom in the coming age and have the full participation of the jubilee in the millennium. </p>
<p data-content-id="454lFLK2tydPg5el7GmBbdHpHQtD5QB0eD81SP4uSuDpX_AQORq44Je3A02kXbzxC"> We all need to see that enjoying Christ as the kingdom of God in this age qualifies us to enjoy Him as the jubilee in the next age. In other words, the present enjoyment of Christ qualifies us to enjoy Him in a further way in the coming age. However, thousands and even millions of those <span class="pg" data-page-id="381" id="381">[381]</span> who believe in the Lord and who have received His salvation do not enjoy Him. This failure to enjoy the Lord today will disqualify them from enjoying Him as the jubilee in the coming age. We need to be impressed with the fact that today’s enjoyment of Christ qualifies us to have the enjoyment of the jubilee in the next age and even ushers us into this enjoyment. Therefore, let us learn to enjoy Christ in the church life so that we may be qualified to enjoy Him in the kingdom age. </p>
<p data-content-id="ov0pwXq8uOJOycOiB1KN-c2IpYzHGrTUx1Dbcc3jku5CrgeFN6HqgZR5btlLER604"> The jubilee proclaimed by the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70263" data-verses="Luke 4:1">chapter four</span> of Luke is of three stages: first, the stage of grace in this age; second, the stage of the kingdom in the coming age; and third, the stage of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. These are the three stages of the enjoyment of the jubilee. The jubilee in this age is a foretaste. The jubilee in the coming age will be fuller than today’s jubilee. Ultimately, in the New Jerusalem we shall enjoy the jubilee to the fullest extent for eternity. There all believers will enjoy Christ as the jubilee. For eternity there will be a testimony that the Lord Jesus is our jubilee, that He has set us free from bondage and has brought us into the full enjoyment of the processed Triune God. </p>

In this message we shall begin to consider the fourth section of this book—the Man-Savior’s presentation of Himself to death for redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="crbZLnwlQe1t-R2NIHEjvLAIu5vZMDiBZWVp3fX5a8i7iFrksEzKqpk9CFqNeA0KZ"> The Lord Jesus made the long journey from Galilee to Jerusalem for the purpose of being put to death. He knew that in Jerusalem He would present Himself to God on the <span class="pg" data-page-id="382" id="382">[382]</span> altar. In the book of Leviticus the offerings offered on the altar are types of Christ, and in the New Testament fulfillment the altar is the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y58zRdwVwZdOug4OktHYXzOi5YTN0tMwYIpE2xtAxeB5rWIwx_UI_h1Cxbmt9gLsn"> The Bible reveals that Christ is not only the offerings, but also the offering Priest to offer the sacrifice to God. This means that He is both the Priest and the offerings. As the offering Priest, He presented Himself to the altar, to the cross. The thought that Christ is both the offering and the Priest is revealed clearly in the Epistle of Hebrews. In Hebrews we see that Christ is the High Priest who offered Himself to God as the eternal sacrifice (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70271" data-verses="Hebrews 9:11">Heb. 9:11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70272" data-verses="Hebrews 9:14">14</span>). Now in the Gospel of Luke we see that Christ went down from Galilee, the place where He was working, to Jerusalem, the place where He would be put to death. In Jerusalem He would be both the offering and the Priest presenting this offering to God on the cross. </p>

On the contrary, He went to Jerusalem of His own initiative. Furthermore, He did not sneak into Jerusalem as a thief, but entered the city in a public way. When He drew close to Jerusalem, He prepared Himself to enter the city as a King. However, He did not enter the city as a king in splendor but as a King in humility. Instead of riding on a horse, He rode on a colt that sovereignly was made ready for Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="SlZ9LfzTj9oNzJ6-paC1I6W-FtUqhJ-Hu1E2vmyVDkctfWDUrJm1vTh_wbOlz4rGj"> How this colt was prepared for the Lord’s use is a mystery. The Lord simply told two of His disciples, “Go into the village opposite you, in which, as you are entering, you will find a colt tied, on which no man has ever yet sat. Untie it and bring it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70273" data-verses="Luke 19:30">19:30</span>). The Lord went on to tell the disciples that if they were asked why they were untying the colt, they should say, “Because the Lord needs it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70274" data-verses="Luke 19:31">v. 31</span>). The disciples went away and found the colt just as the Lord had told them. When they were asked why they were untying the colt, they replied, “Because the Lord needs it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70275" data-verses="Luke 19:34">v. 34</span>). Then <span class="pg" data-page-id="383" id="383">[383]</span> they brought the colt to Jesus, “and throwing their garments on the colt, they put Jesus on it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70276" data-verses="Luke 19:35">v. 35</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="gIbolEPmx05b9aaM7ItXd9j6mLMAfdyt6RkK1EfHgPUcUpUKFw_EQp0WLDUU4a_bg"> It may seem that the preparation of the colt was not a great matter. Actually, for the colt to be prepared in such a mysterious way was something great. Only the Creator of the universe could do such a thing. No doubt, the Lord Jesus is the real King. He spoke a brief word to His disciples concerning the colt. When they took His word and acted on it, everything happened exactly as He said it would. </p>

Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70302" data-verses="Luke 20:1">20:1—21:4</span> we see that the Lord passed through the examination of the chief priests, scribes, and elders (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70303" data-verses="Luke 20:1-19">vv. 1-19</span>), of the Pharisees and the Herodians (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70304" data-verses="Luke 20:20-26">vv. 20-26</span>), and of the Sadducees (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70305" data-verses="Luke 20:27-38">vv. 27-38</span>).

Here we see that leaders from the Jewish community were prepared to test Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="388" id="388">[388]</span> Actually this test was not initiated by them; it was initiated by the Man-Savior. He knew that, according to the prophecy, He had to be killed on the Passover as the Lamb of God.

<p data-content-id="-L1fy_zrwSJXUU5n4u3TQRRsvBf8gL-7zbw6oEqqqLY7uMvSfrnIP_SgjrRC490ZA"> The Man-Savior had been ministering for over three years in the despised region of Galilee, far from the holy temple and the holy city, the place where it was necessary for Him to die for the accomplishment of God’s eternal plan. As the Lamb of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70311" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>), He had to be offered to God at Mount Moriah, where Abraham offered Isaac and enjoyed God’s provision of a ram as a substitute for his son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70312" data-verses="Genesis 22:2">Gen. 22:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70313" data-verses="Genesis 22:9-14">9-14</span>) and where the temple was built in Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70314" data-verses="2Chronicles 3:1">2 Chron. 3:1</span>). It had to be there that He would be delivered, according to the counsel determined by the Trinity of the Godhead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70315" data-verses="Acts 2:23">Acts 2:23</span>), to the Jewish leaders and there be rejected by them as the builders of God’s building (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70316" data-verses="Acts 4:11">Acts 4:11</span>). It was also there that He had to be crucified according to the Roman style of punishment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70317" data-verses="John 18:31-32">John 18:31-32</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70318" data-verses="John 19:6">19:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70319" data-verses="John 19:14-15">14-15</span>) to fulfill the type concerning the kind of death He would die (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70320" data-verses="Numbers 21:8-9">Num. 21:8-9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70321" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span>). Moreover, that was the very year that Messiah (Christ) was to be cut off (killed) according to Daniel’s prophecy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70322" data-verses="Daniel 9:24-26">Dan. 9:24-26</span>). Furthermore, as the Passover Lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70323" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:7">1 Cor. 5:7</span>) He had to be killed in the month of the Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70324" data-verses="Exodus 12:1-11">Exo. 12:1-11</span>). Hence, He had to go to Jerusalem before the Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70325" data-verses="John 12:1">John 12:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70326" data-verses="Mark 14:1">Mark 14:1</span>) so that He might die there on the day of the Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70327" data-verses="John 18:28">John 18:28</span>) at both the place and the time foreordained by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="pQRuKAJlDonWZe7uXYxG1dCH2ZE-H030jYTeXH3ooRncRbKpIKHOqeYDJyj9C--Un"> According to the prophecy in the Old Testament, both the place and the time of the Lord’s death were definite. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70328" data-verses="Daniel 9:25-26">Daniel 9:25 and 26a</span> say, “Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem, unto the Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself.” Here we see that the Messiah, the Christ, would be killed at the end of the sixty-ninth week. The year in <span class="pg" data-page-id="389" id="389">[389]</span> which the Man-Savior went up to Jerusalem to die was the very year prophesied in the ninth chapter of Daniel. Even more specifically, the Lord was to be put to death on the Passover, that is, on the fourteenth day of the month. The Lord knew that it was necessary for Him to be in Jerusalem in time to die on the Passover. Furthermore, according to the prophecy concerning the Passover lamb, He needed to be examined for four days. Therefore, it was necessary for Him to be in Jerusalem at least four days before His crucifixion. </p>
<p data-content-id="vOVAPClIw9o-SMbO5MFlE3Sn2shm1hmqQ-J4zvC1dCk_Dq1MQU0ZikmVpJu7Jramo"> In the Gospels we see that the Lord Jesus was very careful not to be killed either before or after the appointed time. If He had been killed before the Passover, there would have been no way for the prophecy to be fulfilled. In such a case, He would not have been the real Lamb of the Passover. But since He was the real Passover Lamb, He preserved Himself until the time had come for Him to be offered on the cross. </p>

He knew that if He had been put to death even one day earlier, He would have missed the mark concerning the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy. Therefore, the Lord was very careful in returning to the temple each day. His purpose in going back to the temple was to present Himself to the Jewish people for them to thoroughly examine Him. We have the record of this examination in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70329" data-verses="Luke 20:1">20:1—21:4</span>. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70331" data-verses="Luke 20:1">chapter twenty</span> of the Gospel of Luke we have a picture of the Man-Savior behaving Himself in the highest standard of morality. Of course, in all the foregoing chapters we have seen the Lord’s high standard of morality produced by His divine essence with the divine attributes and His human essence with the human virtues. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70332" data-verses="Luke 20:1">chapter twenty</span> we have a more detailed portrait of the Man-Savior’s highest standard of morality. </p>
<p data-content-id="HjWwmoGOlsak0TUDXCy_selVb6Y9pPEtBKlHqojq6TpIxbKDnyfW41Pa33wfqt__Y"> The chief priests, scribes, and elders said to the Lord, “Tell us by what authority you are doing these things, or who is the one who gave you this authority?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70333" data-verses="Luke 20:2">20:2</span>). They thought that they could catch the Lord by asking Him about the source of His authority. As the One who was being examined, the God-man was frank, genuine, wise, and dignified. But those who were questioning Him were base, subtle, insidious, and dishonest. They did not come either with a proper attitude or in a proper spirit. </p>

This was a question according to their religious concept. Second, the fundamental Pharisees and political Herodians asked Him a question related to politics. Third, the Sadducees questioned Him concerning the resurrection. After answering all their questions wisely, the Lord asked them a question concerning Christ. This is the question of questions. Their questions were related to religion, politics, and belief. His question was concerning Christ, who is the center of all things.

David therefore calls Him Lord, and how is He his son?” As God in His divinity, Christ is the Lord of David. As man in His humanity, He is the Son of David. His examiners had only half the scriptural knowledge concerning Christ’s Person, that He was the Son of David according to His humanity.

The Lord’s intention in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70370" data-verses="Luke 20:41-44">20:41-44</span> was to help His examiners to see that the One they were questioning was actually the Lord. </p>

The Man-Savior, as the real Passover Lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70372" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:7">1 Cor. 5:7</span>), was also examined for four days before He was killed.

These will receive even more judgment.” After muzzling the mouths of all His opposers, the Savior warned His disciples of the hypocrisy and evils of the scribes.

As such, He was concerned to see how God’s people expressed their loyalty in their offering to Him. In this way He appraised the widow’s loyalty to God. The Man-Savior’s observation is more penetrating than man’s. </p>

Those who examined the Lord had a low standard of morality.

The rising up of nation against nation refers to civil war, and the rising up of kingdom against kingdom refers to international war. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70440" data-verses="Luke 21:13">verse 13</span> the Lord says that this persecution will turn out to the disciples for a testimony. </p>

Neither should we prepare beforehand to defend ourselves. Whenever we are about to suffer persecution, we should not consider beforehand what we shall say. Instead, we should trust in the Lord, for He will give us a mouth and wisdom. </p>

The Lord’s word here is a fulfillment of His word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70447" data-verses="Luke 12:52-53">12:52 and 53</span>: <span class="pg" data-page-id="407" id="407">[407]</span> “From now on there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.

As part of this preparation, He tells them of things to come (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70472" data-verses="Luke 21:5-36">21:5-36</span>). We have seen that these things include the destruction of the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70473" data-verses="Luke 21:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>), the plagues between the Lord’s ascension and the great tribulation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70474" data-verses="Luke 21:7-11">vv. 7-11</span>), the persecution of His disciples in the church age (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70475" data-verses="Luke 21:12-19">vv. 12-19</span>), and the great tribulation and the Lord’s coming (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70476" data-verses="Luke 21:20-27">vv. 20-27</span>).

Paul speaks of this redemption in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70479" data-verses="Romans 8:23">Romans 8:23</span>: “Even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70480" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span> he speaks of the transfiguration of our body: “The Lord Jesus Christ, who will transfigure the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70481" data-verses="Luke 21:20-21">vv. 20-21</span>). Therefore, the redemption in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70482" data-verses="Luke 21:28">Luke 21:28</span>, the redemption that is drawing near, is not the redemption of our spirit or soul but the redemption of our body.

So also you, when you see these things taking place, know that the kingdom of God is near.” The fig tree, signifying the nation of Israel, was cursed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70484" data-verses="Matthew 21:19">Matthew 21:19</span>. It passed through a long “winter,” from the first century to A.D. 1948, when the nation of Israel was restored. That was its branch becoming tender and putting forth its leaves. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mixvss-j9tzRFTxyvd58GaRNaqOl6bARPohV1ILcl2Rfd6ZbvrtmR-ZjJ-Sa8BhLR"> This fig tree is a sign to the believers of the end of this age. The fig tree becoming tender (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70485" data-verses="Matthew 24:32">Matt. 24:32</span>) signifies that life has come back. The sprouting of leaves in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70486" data-verses="Luke 21:30">Luke 21:30</span> signifies outward activities. Winter signifies the time of being dried up, the time of tribulation, whereas summer signifies the age of the restored kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70487" data-verses="Luke 21:30-31">Luke 21:30-31</span>), which will begin at the Lord’s second coming. </p>

However, in the Bible the word “near” does not mean that something will happen within a few days or even within several years. To the Lord an event that will take place in two thousand years may still be regarded as near, because with Him time and space do not mean anything. </p>
<p data-content-id="iKUb-yZjUMq0U5rbPymQWPiKhlmsitCl_HgCC1JygvKdbgTH8NQIWMexx8ZGM2f34"> When I heard about the re-formation of Israel in 1948, I was excited. I said to myself, “Look, the end of the age must be near. The nation of Israel has been under the control of the Gentiles since the time of Nebuchadnezzar. Now Israel has been re-formed as a nation.” I thought that probably in just a few years the Lord would come back. But thirty-six years have gone by, and the “leaves” are still sprouting. Even though Jerusalem was returned to the Jews in 1967, we can still say only that the time is “near.” </p>

Dissipation and drunkenness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70498" data-verses="Luke 21:34">21:34</span> refer to the indulgence of the lustful self in the excess of the enjoyment of eating and drinking.

Dissipation, drunkenness, and the anxiety of life have never been as prevailing as they are today. On the one hand, people are struggling for enjoyment; on the other hand, they are suffering from anxiety. Dissipation, drunkenness, and anxiety lead to different kinds of disease. This country is very good, but consider how many people are struggling to indulge their lusts. Many are competing with others to have better cars and houses. But as they struggle for enjoyment, they suffer from the anxiety of life. As a result, that day will come upon them as a snare. </p>

Rather, the snare is the time of the great tribulation, the hour of trial, which will come upon the whole earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70540" data-verses="Revelation 3:10">Rev. 3:10</span>). Thus, the great tribulation will come in as a snare upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="uZQjh9ACdCObo73nEgamSZADnu18yBYq6-Sf_S2e8ePelXrhqcHNu9IrQr-mDbhX0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70541" data-verses="Luke 21:24">verse 24</span> the Lord Jesus speaks of the times of the Gentiles: “And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive to all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled by the nations until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.” The times of the Gentiles here does not refer to the period of grace, which is the time for the Gentiles to be saved, as indicated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70542" data-verses="Romans 11:25">Romans 11:25</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70543" data-verses="Luke 21:24">Luke 21:24</span> the times of the Gentiles signifies the time for the Gentiles to control the nation of Israel. This control began with Nebuchadnezzar and will be completed when Antichrist is <span class="pg" data-page-id="420" id="420">[420]</span> destroyed at the war of Armageddon referred to in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70544" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="y695EWmpNHnEWPC-qpj1C12J3jSUoQBFyaZAx96FqVB_sFX0OYnWKsHhj6JUg1n-e"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70545" data-verses="Luke 21:24">Verse 24</span> is a difficult verse for expositors. The reason for the difficulty is that certain prophecies in the Bible concerning the destruction of Jerusalem mingle two or three things together. The temple has already been polluted twice, and it will be polluted once more in the future. The temple was polluted first by Antiochus Epiphanes, who is signified by the little horn in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70546" data-verses="Daniel 8:8-9">Daniel 8:8-9</span>. Antiochus was a type of Titus, the Roman prince who polluted the temple for the second time in A.D. 70. Hence, the prophecy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70547" data-verses="Daniel 8:1">Daniel 8</span> mixes the pollution of the temple by both Antiochus Epiphanes and Titus. Furthermore, the prophecy concerning Titus at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70548" data-verses="Daniel 9:1">Daniel 9</span> mixes him with Antichrist. Therefore, the prophecies in Daniel concerning the destruction of Jerusalem imply the destruction by Antiochus Epiphanes, Titus, and Antichrist. </p>
<p data-content-id="8rK9hZU17CqFQv_7e8sMeUDV076l38frJWrb3fYskUnsCbvB8WxSNVgXi8Bko75qT"> As we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70549" data-verses="Luke 21:24">Luke 21:24</span>, we may think that this verse describes the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus. However, if we consider the context, we shall see that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70550" data-verses="Luke 21:24">verse 24</span> does not refer to the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70551" data-verses="Luke 21:25">Verse 25</span> says, “And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and upon the earth anguish of nations in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the billows.” According to history, such things did not happen after Titus destroyed Jerusalem. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70552" data-verses="Luke 21:26-27">verses 26 and 27</span> go on to say, “Men fainting from fear and expectation of what is coming upon the inhabited earth; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power.” Of course, these things did not happen after Titus destroyed Jerusalem. Therefore, these verses indicate that the destruction in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70553" data-verses="Luke 21:24">verse 24</span> should refer to a future destruction, the coming destruction of Jerusalem under Antichrist. </p>
<p data-content-id="0yMFLpTNFijhdJXKdCtsRVr0HDyobmW8BsYvNv_3Cioz9unzd69fVMg-p6C0n6Ifp"> Today Jerusalem is free. But when Antichrist rises up against God, he will capture Jerusalem and destroy it. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70554" data-verses="Luke 21:24">Luke 21:24</span> speaks of this coming destruction. </p>
<p data-content-id="7WKyJ1T_uHk5hAsLLT81oK8FJj4I670thJCRuFLar2G9usySzvd5B-MQRqEDy9EDO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70555" data-verses="Luke 21:5-36">21:5-36</span> we have the Man-Savior’s prophecy of things to come. First, He unveils to His disciples the destruction of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="421" id="421">[421]</span> temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70556" data-verses="Luke 21:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>). Then He goes on to speak of the plagues that will come between His ascension and the great tribulation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70557" data-verses="Luke 21:7-11">vv. 7-11</span>). During this same period of time, the time between the Lord’s ascension and the great tribulation, the followers of Christ will be persecuted. The Lord speaks of this persecution in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70558" data-verses="Luke 21:12-19">verses 12 through 19</span>. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70559" data-verses="Luke 21:7-19">21:7-19</span> we see that two things will take place during the same period—plagues and persecution. </p>
<p data-content-id="_ZwqsA5v5sK5Gd_CEuUVx_U-oyUvJZvrd4_dLBztnh2YyrGo-ZQKJ0rrkSkFZAXKk"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70560" data-verses="Luke 21:20-27">verses 20 through 27</span> the Lord speaks concerning the great tribulation and His coming, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70561" data-verses="Luke 21:28-36">verses 28 through 36</span>, of the disciples’ redemption and the overcomers’ rapture. Before the time of trial, the great tribulation, we need to be watchful, at every time beseeching, so that we might escape “all these things which are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70562" data-verses="Luke 21:36">v. 36</span>). This is to be raptured before the great tribulation, that is, to be taken to the throne in the heavens. While the plagues are taking place and the persecution is going on, we are waiting to be raptured. But if we would be raptured before the great tribulation comes, we need to be watchful and take heed to ourselves, lest at some time our hearts be weighed down with dissipation, drunkenness, and the anxieties of life, and that day come upon us suddenly as a snare (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70563" data-verses="Luke 21:34">v. 34</span>). We need to be watchful so that our hearts will not be weighed down with dissipation, drunkenness, and the anxieties of the present life. </p>
<p data-content-id="B-xax8NKp7LCijI7TsQMm9Jos3kSlmvYlicWUqjousBPGePPVlOH7nulgHhpJQvmR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70564" data-verses="Luke 21:5">Luke 21:5—22:46</span> is a section in which the Man-Savior prepares the disciples for His death. The Lord accomplishes this preparation in two ways: first, by telling the disciples of things to come (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70565" data-verses="Luke 21:5-36">21:5-36</span>); second, by instituting His supper so that the disciples may participate in His death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70566" data-verses="Luke 22:7-23">22:7-23</span>). Even by instituting His supper, or what we may call the Lord’s table, the Man-Savior was preparing the disciples for His redemptive death. </p>

The Lord’s sovereignty was exercised here, for this was the year in which Messiah had to be cut off, that is, the year in which the preordained Savior had to die. Furthermore, the exact month and day had been prophesied in the Old Testament. It was crucial, therefore, that the Savior be put to death on the exact day prophesied and typified in the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="dvWnnIN7e0JKw-7c9JXxsoFKvbCR3lHyth-Z-qR8i3gE62O3MzE72ycw46N8mvBgO"> It was not easy for everything to be arranged so that the Man-Savior would be put to death at the exact time and place. This certainly required the exercise of the sovereignty of the Triune God. The Son prepared Himself to die. The Spirit and the Father were also working to prepare the environment so that the Son would die on the cross exactly according to what was prophesied and typified in the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="QS_uuvFcVjx6uGVtLtuBZAQnlYKY1jnXQkbZwmBnmy1XcRsI7z2kVs1C7kIjs7vSf"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70567" data-verses="Luke 22:1">Luke 22</span> we see that while the Man-Savior was preparing Himself to die, the opposers were busy with their plot, their conspiracy. At the same time, the enemy of God, Satan, also was busy. Whenever God is busy, Satan is busy as well. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70568" data-verses="Luke 22:1">chapter twenty-two</span> both the Triune God and Satan were busy. In particular, Satan was actively using Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve apostles appointed by the Man-Savior. Satan instigated Judas’ betrayal of the Lord Jesus. Satan injected into Judas the thought of finding an opportunity to deliver the Lord into the hand of those who wanted to kill Him. Therefore, in this chapter we see both the plotting of the opposers and the working of Satan. On the one hand, “the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might do away with Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70569" data-verses="Luke 22:2">v. 2</span>). On the other hand, “Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. And he went away and conversed with the chief priests and officers as to how he might deliver Him up to them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70570" data-verses="Luke 22:3-4">vv. 3-4</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="K6HmpZJGTPRsiY1al2OYCD534UlqtsBFDVHQgSo9S8is_l13ggA-7Yse3XgT2zYV3">THE PASSOVER REPLACED BY THE LORD’S SUPPER</h2><p data-content-id="lXx03sAZnH1566ErM-gk8LmN6YjVqHNC8OyUynANn47kviFgaPXvRFBN-BRclOuC0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70571" data-verses="Luke 22:7-23">22:7-23</span> the Man-Savior instituted His supper as a replacement of the Old Testament Passover. In the Old Testament the Passover was a great matter, a matter that may <span class="pg" data-page-id="423" id="423">[423]</span> be considered equal to God’s creation. In the Old Testament we first have the record of God’s creation. Then we see that the man created by God fell and eventually went down into Egypt. When God was about to save His people from bondage in Egypt, He ordained the feast of Passover. The Passover was the time when God’s people were saved and brought back to their right, which had been lost. The observance of the Passover lasted for more than fifteen hundred years, from the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70572" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span> until the night in which the Man-Savior had the last Passover with His disciples. </p>

<p data-content-id="zYdoNmJ8sJ3EfPJeHn3Nk6bY9_7RUWZfgnhUmVfdTB_5mEQTlpUx_z2KThQMh-S0-"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70626" data-verses="Luke 22:7-20">22:7-20</span> we have both the Passover and the Lord’s supper. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70627" data-verses="Luke 22:7-18">verses 7 through 18</span> there is a record concerning the eating of the Passover, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70628" data-verses="Luke 22:19-20">verses 19 and 20</span>, a record concerning the Lord’s instituting His supper so that the disciples may participate in His death. In the Passover the main thing enjoyed by God’s chosen people was the lamb. The meat of the lamb was for them to eat. But in the Lord’s table the main item for us to enjoy as New Testament believers is not a lamb; the main item for our enjoyment is bread. This is very significant, and in this message we need to consider this in more detail than we have done previously. </p>
<p data-content-id="aJBHB16Du0i39s63r9r4_1PcHmEpg--JpExe5woWN23707a7BR6E28G078JPrLzJy"> When the Lord Jesus was offered to God for our redemption, He was offered not as bread but as a Lamb. However, the outcome is not the Lamb but bread. The Lamb was a single entity, but bread is something corporate. It is not possible for a single grain of wheat to form a loaf of bread. A loaf is a corporate entity, something composed and constituted of many grains. With the feast of the Passover there is not the concept of feasting on something that is corporate in nature. But with the Lord’s table the symbols, especially the loaf, bear a very significant characteristic, and this characteristic is that of a corporate entity, a corporate body. It is very important that we realize this. </p>
<p data-content-id="baXaoDjM31g4vdogPOo_K0psY6kl2rRDOpin976WeiNY5gEGyluhr_T3XIAmn92Sv"> The loaf in the Lord’s table points to something that comes after the Lord’s death; it signifies something that issues from <span class="pg" data-page-id="430" id="430">[430]</span> the Lord in His resurrection. What is signified by the loaf is not something before the Lord’s death, but something after His death and in His resurrection. Before His death, the Lord Jesus was a single, individual Lamb. But what issues out of His death in resurrection is a corporate entity. This entity is the loaf, the bread, which signifies a corporate body. </p>
<p data-content-id="qMcyXCf9JxgO6C4J5XfI-vetWR45eDmy97SasR1HjYltLhBmhnwtFer_oxArsFU1X"> In the Gospel of Luke, of course, we do not see much development concerning the bread of the Lord’s table. We need to remember, however, that Luke’s impression of this came from Paul’s revelation. Regarding the bread, we should go from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70629" data-verses="Luke 22:1">Luke 22</span> to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70630" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:17">1 Corinthians 10:17</span>: “Seeing that we who are many are one bread, one Body; for we all partake of the one bread.” Here we see that the bread signifies not only the physical body of the Savior; it also signifies His mystical Body, which is the church. This is not a matter of an individual; it is a matter of a corporate Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="nV3M-hxr_PahH5f0BOXBPMrmHTm7hkZMtOU1wXRdLUKzbd2Rwvo4ANlkJXwIqXfdH"> We are all one bread, one Body, because we all partake of the one bread. Our joint partaking of the one bread testifies that we all are one. This indicates that our partaking of Christ makes us all His one Body. The very Christ of whom we all partake constitutes us into His one Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="6v5bqSZVkxM1HMGlVPheNpm8O5Ww8o25b4qVQMP5MlzkvkTR8-sJeZYdiAzVYImAy"> In the Gospel of Luke the word “church” is not used. Nevertheless, there are certain hints, or indications, of the church in this Gospel. For instance, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70631" data-verses="Luke 10:1">chapter ten</span> the inn refers to the church. Likewise, the house of the father in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70632" data-verses="Luke 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> indicates the church. Furthermore, there is a hint concerning the church in the parable of the vineyard in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70633" data-verses="Luke 20:1">chapter twenty</span>. The Jewish leaders are likened to vinedressers. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70634" data-verses="Luke 20:16">20:16</span>, the vinedressers are destroyed, and the vineyard is given to others. These “others” are the New Testament believers, who are the components of the church. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70635" data-verses="Luke 20:17-18">20:17 and 18</span> the Lord went on to refer to Himself as the cornerstone: “What then is this that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner?” This cornerstone surely is for the building up of the church. This is another strong indication that the church is referred to in this Gospel. Now in chapter <span class="pg" data-page-id="431" id="431">[431]</span> twenty-two the loaf is related to the church. According to the development elsewhere in the New Testament, the loaf, the bread, signifies the Body of Christ, the church. Therefore, the loaf in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70636" data-verses="Luke 22:19">22:19</span> points to the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="RZzGEogxd1MGIsl2dZZkp2iHSdLcm5J3IdyqcTX_a5S28-G-Yz8OH2qUTV12ioiQD"> Before His death the Man-Savior was a Lamb. But after His death and in His resurrection, He became a loaf. In the Old Testament feast of the Passover the enjoyment was of the lamb, but in the New Testament feast the enjoyment is of the loaf. The Lamb has become a loaf through the process of death and resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="sd53dK7V3RACxeAhYZparIvJWY7CXd4lKCZrOk5KHHUk8v9DyXsEuqfotQsdDEpDq"> At the Lord’s table we display, exhibit, the Lord’s death. But we display His death in His resurrection. Whenever we come to the Lord’s table, we should keep in mind that we are not in His death but in His resurrection. Because we are now participating in the loaf, in the Lord’s resurrection we are displaying His death. This loaf includes not only the Lord Himself; it includes the Lord with us. Therefore, the loaf is no longer the individual Christ; it is now the corporate Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70637" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:12">1 Cor. 12:12</span>), including the Lord Jesus and the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="whXJpCNVhaMbONnpNpVlLEbV78Gr88OYrW5ZYazISocRSVFEj93Rh6WuKCXo2tcws"> In the institution of the Lord’s table the loaf is the main element. On the cross we see the Lamb, but on the table we see the loaf. When we are at the Lord’s table, we need to realize that the loaf includes the Head and the Body; that is, it includes Christ and all the believers. Hence, it is a complete loaf, a corporate entity. Praise the Lord that the Lamb has become the loaf! Through His death and in His resurrection, the Lamb has become the loaf. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70638" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>, the Lord fell into the earth and died as a grain of wheat and then in resurrection became a loaf composed of many grains. This loaf is inexhaustible! </p>
<p data-content-id="Lj54LQasZ-K8EIg0K9wBinZk1nfFprp5qpL9M39N7uxjTamFkVxVWNhxhdjVx7yWi"> After considering the Lord’s table again and again for many years, I can testify that the bread and the cup are inexhaustible. Before the Lord Jesus went to the cross, He was the Lamb individually. But after passing through death and coming forth in resurrection, He became a loaf that includes both Him and us. Furthermore, the blood He shed on the cross has become a covenant, and this covenant has <span class="pg" data-page-id="432" id="432">[432]</span> become a cup, a portion that is God Himself as a blessing for our enjoyment. God is allotted to us in this cup; He is our portion for us to enjoy. In this we see the significance of the Lord’s supper instituted in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70639" data-verses="Luke 22:1">chapter twenty-two</span>. We thank the Lord for giving us such an understanding of His supper. </p>

Peter might have said to himself, “The Lord speaks of a loaf and then of His body? What does this mean? How can a loaf be a body? A loaf is of the vegetable life, and a body is of the animal life. How can the vegetable life become the animal life? I don’t understand this.” Furthermore, James and John may not have cared for the loaf, but only for sitting on the Lord’s right and left. James may have said to himself, “I don’t care for this loaf. I care for the throne and for whether or not I shall sit at the Lord’s right or left.” The disciples had neither the heart nor the ears for the Lord’s word concerning the loaf and the cup. </p>
<p data-content-id="AUNZZyVVAVOomKPrvQGiXXO12JhGBpIJR1Zd6ilPf-0XAUbPCWwsUR_yeQ_zGl6pN"> We should learn of the disciples and be different. We should not care for the throne or for sitting at the Lord’s right or left hand. Rather, we should care for the loaf, the Body, the church life, and we should also care for the cup, for the Triune God being our portion for us to enjoy for eternity. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="FyPO0Bs_RXrorVGaqbNdDoLFgpUWneMjMpEk0aYSfanBP0SA21ajMTzZdZb6Sdt3F">DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2><p data-content-id="Cx-Kq8f_kufcXTjbL-whK-V8OaHzT6d8wbuRcXv4ortX3gIXqwulpXeobzCQdoJJ1"> In His ministry, whether in Galilee or on the way to Jerusalem, the Man-Savior emphasized His death and resurrection. Three times He unveiled His death and resurrection to His disciples (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70640" data-verses="Luke 9:21-22">9:21-22</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70641" data-verses="Luke 9:44-45">44-45</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70642" data-verses="Luke 18:31-34">18:31-34</span>). Now with the institution of His supper the most important matter emphasized by Him was again His death and resurrection. It was through His death and resurrection that He terminated the disciples, buried them, redeemed them, and germinated them. By germinating them He made them one with Himself to be the loaf. Furthermore, through His death and resurrection He has brought us all into the Triune God as our <span class="pg" data-page-id="433" id="433">[433]</span> blessing. Therefore, by His death and resurrection the Man-Savior has brought us into oneness with Himself as His Body and also into the enjoyment of the Triune God and all that He has been doing for us. </p>

In this message we come to the fifth main section of Luke—the death of the Man-Savior (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70698" data-verses="Luke 22:47">22:47—23:56</span>). In this section we see that the Lord was arrested (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70699" data-verses="Luke 22:47-65">22:47-65</span>), judged (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70700" data-verses="Luke 22:66">22:66—23:25</span>), crucified (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70701" data-verses="Luke 23:26-49">23:26-49</span>), and buried (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70702" data-verses="Luke 23:50-56">23:50-56</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="rR_dpE6vYaDaPaCKn11uuxdGNcFtz_3rupQBp4xmcb2zrtZinaTEqSTzFHUuwqBbj"> After <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70703" data-verses="Luke 22:46">22:46</span> everything was prepared for the death of the Man-Savior. Both the place and the time were right. It was the exact year, month, and even day for Him to die. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dvWnnIN7e0JKw-7c8LXxl4lKvbCR3lHyth-Z-qR8i3gE62O3MzE72ycw46N8mvBgO">ARRESTED</h2><p data-content-id="QS_uuvFcVjx6uGVtKvuBRQgnlYKY1jnXQkbZwmBnmy1XcRsI7z2kVs1C7kIjs7vSf"> The death of the Man-Savior began with His being arrested. When the Lord Jesus came to the Garden of Gethsemane, He realized that He would be arrested there. Nevertheless, just as He took the initiative to go from Galilee to Jerusalem, He took the initiative to go to the Garden of Gethsemane. Of course, the eleven disciples did not know what was happening. However, the Man-Savior knew what He was doing and what steps He was taking. He went to the place where He would be delivered to those who were coming to arrest Him and put Him to death. </p>
<p data-content-id="dvWnnIN7e0JKw-7c8LXxsqFKvbCR3lHyth-Z-qR8i3gE62O3MzE72ycw46N8mvBgO"> When the Lord Jesus was arrested, three categories of people were around Him: those who arrested Him, His <span class="pg" data-page-id="440" id="440">[440]</span> disciples, and those who judged Him. The ones who arrested the Man-Savior were evil religionists. They were religious, but they were false, hypocritical, and filled with deceit. They were not worthy to be categorized with those who are merely natural or in the old creation. They were actually evil, false, and deceitful. </p>
<p data-content-id="QS_uuvFcVjx6uGVtKvuBZCQnlYKY1jnXQkbZwmBnmy1XcRsI7z2kVs1C7kIjs7vSf"> The second category of people around the Lord Jesus when He was arrested consisted of His followers. The disciples had a good intention, but they were altogether in the natural realm. Here we do not see any sign that they were in the spiritual realm; rather, they were in the old creation. In a sense, they partook of the loaf and the cup. But even after doing so they contended which of them was the greatest. By this we see how natural they were. Furthermore, when the Lord Jesus told them that they would be stumbled, Peter rose up to deny it: “Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70704" data-verses="Luke 22:33">22:33</span>). Moreover, when the Lord told the disciples to be prepared to face the situation, they thought that it was necessary for them to buy swords to fight. Therefore, the Lord said to them, “It is enough” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70705" data-verses="Luke 22:38">22:38</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="K6HmpZJGTPRsiY1ak0OYBDZ34UlqtsBFDVHQgSo9S8is_l13ggA-7Yse3XgT2zYV3"> Because the disciples were in the natural life, they were not able to understand what the Man-Savior was telling them. When the Lord was about to be arrested, “those around Him, seeing what was about to happen, said, Lord, shall we strike with a sword? And a certain one of them struck the slave of the high priest and took off his right ear” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70706" data-verses="Luke 22:49-50">22:49-50</span>). Here we see that the disciples immediately resisted. Peter took the lead to take up a sword, but the Lord stopped them, saying, “Let them go this far! And touching the ear, He healed him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70707" data-verses="Luke 22:51">v. 51</span>). The words, “Let them go this far,” may mean, “Let them arrest Me at this time.” </p>
<p data-content-id="lXx03sAZnH1566ErN8gk_LGN6YjVqHNC8OyUynANn47kviFgaPXvRFBN-BRclOuC0"> After the Man-Savior was arrested, “Peter was following at a distance” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70708" data-verses="Luke 22:54">v. 54b</span>). This is an indication that Peter would deny the Lord. Peter then sat with a number of others by the fire that was kindled in the middle of the courtyard (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70709" data-verses="Luke 22:55">v. 55</span>). This is another indication that he was about to deny the Lord. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70710" data-verses="Luke 22:56-57">Verses 56 and 57</span> say, “And a certain servant girl, <span class="pg" data-page-id="441" id="441">[441]</span> seeing him seated facing the light of the fire, and looking intently at him, said, This man also was with him. But he denied, saying, I do not know Him, woman!” After Peter denied the Lord two more times, a cock crowed, and “the Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him that before a cock crows today, you will deny Me three times” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70711" data-verses="Luke 22:60-61">vv. 60-61</span>). Then Peter went outside and wept bitterly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70712" data-verses="Luke 22:62">v. 62</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="O6A_Zpet8NpkAD12zzHVI8X96Jkgmribh2Ghh9n9QaeX9vJyetjJM0RwCL0BYvdJK"> We know from the other Gospels that the other disciples were scattered. From this we see that the Man-Savior’s followers were natural; they were in the old creation. It is no wonder it was necessary for them to be brought to the cross, terminated, and replaced. Because they were in the old creation, they could not enjoy the jubilee. Knowing what they needed, the Lord brought them with Him to the cross so that they could be terminated and replaced. </p>
<p data-content-id="454lFLK2tydPg5el6H2BbcHpHQtD5QB0eD81SP4uSuDpX_AQORq44Je3A02kXbzxC"> Let us consider more fully those who arrested the Man-Savior. While He was still speaking to His disciples, Judas drew near to Him to kiss Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70713" data-verses="Luke 22:47">v. 47</span>). “But Jesus said to him, Judas, are you delivering up the Son of Man with a kiss?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70714" data-verses="Luke 22:48">v. 48</span>). After pointing out to Judas that he was delivering up the Son of Man by kissing Him in a false way, the Lord said to the chief priests, officers of the temple, and elders who had come up against Him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as against a robber? While I was with you daily in the temple, you did not stretch out your hands against Me; but this is your hour and the authority of darkness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70715" data-verses="Luke 22:52-53">vv. 52-53</span>). The God-forsaking and God-offending opposers, afraid of the people who had warmly welcomed the Man-Savior and were gladdened by His speaking (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70716" data-verses="Mark 12:37">Mark 12:37</span>), dared not arrest Him in the daytime or in a public place like the temple. Instead, they arrested Him subtly in the deep night, as though arresting a robber (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70717" data-verses="Luke 22:52">Luke 22:52</span>). Here the Lord seemed to be saying to them, “Why didn’t you arrest Me while I was teaching in the temple? Why do you come at night instead of in the day, and why do you arrest Me in a private place? You arrest Me in this way because you are afraid of the people. You know that if you tried to arrest Me <span class="pg" data-page-id="442" id="442">[442]</span> in the temple, the people would stone you. Nevertheless, now is your hour and the authority of darkness.” </p>
<p data-content-id="ov0pwXq8uOJOycOiA0aN-d2IpYzHGrTUx1Dbcc3jku5CrgeFN6HqgZR5btlLER604"> The Man-Savior was not afraid of being arrested. On the contrary, He was bold to face the situation, and He even rebuked the falsehood of those who arrested Him. Actually, the Lord was not arrested; He gave Himself over to those who arrested Him. If He had not done this, who could have arrested Him? According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70718" data-verses="John 18:4">John 18:4</span>, the Lord Jesus asked them whom they were seeking. When they answered Him that they were seeking Jesus the Nazarene, “He said to them, I am” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70719" data-verses="John 18:5">v. 5</span>). The record in John goes on to tell us that when “He said to them, I am, they drew back and fell to the ground” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70720" data-verses="John 18:6">v. 6</span>). This indicates that they did not actually arrest the Man-Savior, but that He willingly allowed them to arrest Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="37AX-gTuAtUIfnNeLW6h6mFkDbtYWR3LTu6iLVxczyu6wYZF7FopoaS4d9S_W-BJ4"> As we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70721" data-verses="Luke 22:47">Luke 22:47—23:56</span>, we need to realize who it was who was arrested, judged, and crucified. The One arrested was the very God, God in a man. This means that God was arrested by His creatures, and even arrested in a way of falsehood. Should not the just and righteous God have judged them immediately? But instead of judging them, He tolerated them. He accepted being arrested in order to accomplish redemption both for His followers and for those who arrested Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Gn7ewN6nSdByHJgqiTngXXUOe-1UTJncAcUqo6emH0AAxLxRlyu8isObL6a-GDD-q"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70722" data-verses="Luke 22:63">22:63</span> we are told that the men who were holding the Man-Savior “mocked Him, beating Him.” Then we see that “blindfolding Him, they questioned Him, saying, Prophesy! Who is it that hit you? And they said many other things against Him, blaspheming” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70723" data-verses="Luke 22:64-65">vv. 64-65</span>). The One they were mocking, beating, and blaspheming was the God-man; the One who suffered this was God in a man. If we keep this point in mind as we read this chapter, we shall be deeply impressed that it was the God-man who was blindfolded and blasphemed. </p>

The Sanhedrin was a council composed of the chief priests, the elders, the lawyers, and the scribes.

<p data-content-id="Gn7ewN6nSdByHJgqiTXgQH0Oe-1UTJncAcUqo6emH0AAxLxRlyu8isObL6a-GDD-q"> In this message we shall consider the crucifixion of the Man-Savior (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70775" data-verses="Luke 23:26-49">23:26-49</span>). Throughout the last nineteen centuries there have been many studies of the Lord’s death. For what purpose did the Lord Jesus die, and who actually put Him to death? In other words, why did He die, and who killed Him? Even certain Jewish scholars have been seeking answers to these questions. Even genuine and faithful Christians, those who truly believe in the Lord Jesus, may not have a full knowledge of the purpose of His death and of who killed Him. I am concerned that some among us, both young and old, do not know who killed the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="crbZLnwlQe1t-R2NJGkjpYwIu5vZMDiBZWVp3fX5a8i7iFrksEzKqpk9CFqNeA0KZ"> How would you answer the question concerning who killed the Man-Savior? Some may say that we killed Him and others, that God killed Him. Others may say that the Lord was put to death by religion and politics, or that He was killed by our sin. We should not try to answer this question by our imagination. Instead, we need to come to the honest and accurate record of the Scriptures, especially the record in the Gospel of Luke. As Luke himself says, he “followed all things accurately from the first” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70776" data-verses="Luke 1:3">1:3</span>). Therefore, Luke’s account may be regarded as reliable. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y58zRdwVwZdOug4OlsnYegOi5YTN0tMwYIpE2xtAxeB5rWIwx_UI_h1Cxbmt9gLsn"> As we read the record in this Gospel, we see that the Lord Jesus was put on the cross by man. He was accused by the religious leaders, sentenced to death by Roman rulers, especially Pilate, and then put on the cross by the Roman soldiers. <span class="pg" data-page-id="452" id="452">[452]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="EnWCv_eiedBm6acXfSQA8z436_MxGVx9OO_VMk3ydCyoMCmwj4AjjstBnWwxvP728">SUFFERING THE PERSECUTION OF MEN</h2><p data-content-id="AUNZZyVVAVOomKPrvQmiXVO12JhGBpIJR1Zd6ilPf-0XAUbPCWwsUR_yeQ_zGl6pN"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70777" data-verses="Luke 23:26-43">23:26-43</span> we see that on the cross the Man-Savior suffered the persecution of men. He was mocked and ridiculed by both the Jewish leaders and the Roman soldiers. “And the people stood by, looking on. And the rulers were even sneering and saying, He saved others, let him save himself if this is the Christ of God, the Chosen One! And the soldiers also mocked Him, coming to Him and offering Him vinegar” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70778" data-verses="Luke 23:35-36">vv. 35-36</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="FyPO0Bs_RXrorVGaqbtdDqLFgpUWneMjMpEk0aYSfanBP0SA21ajMTzZdZb6Sdt3F"> The Lord Jesus was put on the cross at nine o’clock in the morning and remained there until three o’clock in the afternoon. This means that He was on the cross for six hours. These six hours may be divided into two groups of three hours each: the first from nine o’clock until noon, and the second from noon until three o’clock in the afternoon. During the first three hours, the Man-Savior suffered the persecution of men. The religious people ridiculed Him, and the Roman soldiers mocked Him. Even “one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70779" data-verses="Luke 23:39">v. 39</span>). Therefore, during the first three hours on the cross, the Lord was a victim of human persecution, and He suffered this persecution as a martyr. </p>

Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70781" data-verses="Luke 23:26-49">23:26-49</span> we see two aspects of the Lord’s death: the aspect of man’s persecution and the aspect of God’s judgment. First the Lord Jesus suffered man’s persecution, and He suffered this as a martyr, not as the Redeemer. Then, as the Redeemer, no longer as a martyr suffering persecution, He suffered God’s judgment for us, the sinners. </p>

<p data-content-id="vOVAPClIw9o-SMbO4N1lE2Sn2shm1hmqQ-J4zvC1dCk_Dq1MQU0ZikmVpJu7Jramo"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70784" data-verses="Matthew 27:45">Matthew 27:45</span>, darkness was over all the land from the sixth hour until the ninth hour, that is, from twelve o’clock noon until three o’clock in the afternoon. Who caused darkness to come over the land? Of course, the high priest, Pilate, and the Roman soldiers were not able to do this. The only one who could cause darkness to come at noon was God. </p>
<p data-content-id="WVNqXX68ZMdi0Is0N2irBa2Mw6vNnBJsEhQPV8kOVHacHdtLj25qcwOhqs0Rn3f7G"> This darkness was an indication that the righteous God had come in to judge the Lord Jesus as our Substitute and Redeemer. He was the unique, universal Substitute for mankind. From nine o’clock until noon, He was persecuted by the Jews and Romans as a martyr. But from noon until three o’clock He was dying not as a martyr, but as the Substitute for sinners. Because God recognized Him as our Redeemer, God came in to judge Him. This means that during the last three hours the Lord was on the cross, He was judged by God for the accomplishment of our redemption. It was during this time that God counted Him as our suffering Substitute for sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70785" data-verses="Isaiah 53:10">Isa. 53:10</span>). Darkness came over all the land because our sin and sins and all negative things were being dealt with. God even forsook Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70786" data-verses="Matthew 27:46">Matt. 27:46</span>) because of our sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="2tNCATtNEU-uXYvQuNw4mnXqLxK2yI2K223oVb_0w5iwpZu36YT9EiPenSev2WCos"> Actually the Lord’s persecutors did not kill Him. While He was under their persecution, He was still alive. After the Lord suffered this persecution for three hours, God came in to put Him to death. The darkness that came over the land was a sign of God’s coming in. Luke tells us that the darkness came over the whole land, not merely over Jerusalem or Mount Zion. God caused the sun’s light to fail. </p>

These are signs proving that from the sixth hour until the ninth hour, that is, from noon until three o’clock in the afternoon, God came in to judge the Redeemer, who was dying as our Substitute. His death was not for Himself; it was for us. Therefore, we may call His death a vicarious death. This death was accomplished by Him for us on the cross and under God’s judgment. </p>

In the words of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70792" data-verses="Isaiah 53:6">Isaiah 53:6</span>, “the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.” The darkness signifies that God had put our sins upon Him. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70793" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span> says that God made Him to be sin for us. Hence, God not only put our sins upon Him; He even made Him to be sin on our behalf. This took place during the second period of three hours. </p>
<p data-content-id="kAQNthUaZvalgvsKCvzCeAsJbCrdyQWj0UWwMbQUlst1TdatH57vU3-PT1x1LNEeo"> It was also during these hours that God forsook the Man-Savior (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70794" data-verses="Mark 15:34">Mark 15:34</span>). Because the Lord is God’s beloved Son, God always delighted in Him. But because God regarded Him as our Substitute, as the One who bore our sins and was made sin for us in God’s sight, God forsook Him. In the sight of God during those hours the Lord was a totality of sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jgkr79uXp4nHSqPJ3H4f1Ncwm7qGnaecC8bfNtJTx_m3Ubj0zJ3n8sOq8U2GgJfUN"> This understanding of the Lord’s death is not guesswork. On the contrary, this understanding is according to the study of the accurate record in the Bible. </p>

This sin indwells us. When our sins were put on the Lord Jesus, He was made the very sin that indwells us. Therefore, both the <span class="pg" data-page-id="455" id="455">[455]</span> root—indwelling sin—and the fruit—our sins—were put upon Him. As such a One, He was judged by God according to His righteousness. </p>

Now we need to see that the Lord Jesus died an all-inclusive death. His death on the cross was not merely vicarious; it was also all-inclusive. Because the Man-Savior is an all-inclusive Person, on the cross He died an all-inclusive death. Let us now go on to consider different aspects of the Lord’s all-inclusive death. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="UwoI3MPYw_sWGgTUaTI7cilGshtzOQ5LUvhTMmv7LdK1FIytONjnEzyH0ZWFVMBnz">The Lamb of God</h2><p data-content-id="Mixvss-j9tzRFTxyufJ8OIhNaqOl6bARPohV1ILcl2Rfd6ZbvrtmR-ZjJ-Sa8BhLR"> According to the record of the entire New Testament, when the Man-Savior died on the cross, He died as seven items. First, He died as the Lamb of God to deal with sin and sins. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70822" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span> says, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” Here the world denotes mankind. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70823" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:3">1 Corinthians 15:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70824" data-verses="1Peter 2:24">1 Peter 2:24</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70825" data-verses="Hebrews 9:28">Hebrews 9:28</span> we see that as the Lamb of God the Lord Jesus died for our sins. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70826" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70827" data-verses="Hebrews 9:26">Hebrews 9:26</span>, His death dealt with sin. Therefore, both sin and sins were dealt with by the Lamb of God, who was under God’s judgment on the cross. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Gn7ewN6nSdByHJgqiTHgXVUOe-1UTJncAcUqo6emH0AAxLxRlyu8isObL6a-GDD-q">A Man in the Flesh</h2><p data-content-id="crbZLnwlQe1t-R2NJG0jvKAIu5vZMDiBZWVp3fX5a8i7iFrksEzKqpk9CFqNeA0KZ"> When the Man-Savior died on the cross, He also died as a man in the flesh. As the Word which was with God and <span class="pg" data-page-id="460" id="460">[460]</span> which is God, He became flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70828" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70829" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70830" data-verses="1Peter 3:18">First Peter 3:18</span> tells us that He was “put to death in flesh.” As a man in the flesh, He had only the likeness, the form, of a fallen man; He did not have the nature of a fallen man. This means that He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70831" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Rom. 8:3</span>), but He did not have the actual nature of sin. Because the Man-Savior died as a man in the flesh, His death dealt with the fallen flesh. Praise the Lord that sin, sins, and the fallen flesh have been dealt with by the death of the Man-Savior! </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Y58zRdwVwZdOug4Ols3YXyOi5YTN0tMwYIpE2xtAxeB5rWIwx_UI_h1Cxbmt9gLsn">A Man in the Old Creation</h2><p data-content-id="EnWCv_eiedBm6acXfSAA0ho36_MxGVx9OO_VMk3ydCyoMCmwj4AjjstBnWwxvP728"> The Lord Jesus also died as a man in the old creation. This is the reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70832" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Romans 6:6</span> says that our old man was crucified with Him. Because the Lord died on the cross as a man in the old creation, our old man was dealt with through His death. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="DoAIPBJjBHkq_0FWe5zCgcupXz6H4o4mOlsgbBKk_d-ko1FGk9fqp5bptFLQcr1Cs">The Serpent</h2><p data-content-id="SlZ9LfzTj9oNzJ6-oby1I5W-FtUqhJ-Hu1E2vmyVDkctfWDUrJm1vTh_wbOlz4rGj"> It may come as a great surprise to hear that the Man-Savior died on the cross even as the serpent. “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70833" data-verses="John 3:14-15">John 3:14-15</span>). Here the Lord Jesus applies to Himself the type of the brass serpent lifted up by Moses in the wilderness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70834" data-verses="Numbers 21:4-9">Num. 21:4-9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="gIbolEPmx05b9aaM6JdXe8D6mLMAfdyt6RkK1EfHgPUcUpUKFw_EQp0WLDUU4a_bg"> No doubt, the Lord Jesus was crucified as a serpent in form in order to deal with Satan, the Devil, the old serpent. As fallen human beings, we all have been bitten by this serpent. Do you know when we were bitten? We were bitten in the Garden of Eden when Adam was bitten by the serpent and poisoned by him. Therefore, it was necessary for our Savior to be crucified as the serpent in form in order to deal with the old serpent. </p>
<p data-content-id="eZHFLAbNWwOTr1-IvviDpgNBlkr6ZBJMGzugC7yI_anSHrEw64TAXVbz6cBzraKtb"> It was through being crucified as the serpent that the Lord Jesus crushed the head of the old serpent, the Devil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70835" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Gen. 3:15</span>). In this way, He judged the ruler of this world. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70836" data-verses="John 12:31">John 12:31</span> says, “Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.” By His death on <span class="pg" data-page-id="461" id="461">[461]</span> the cross, the Man-Savior destroyed the Devil, who had the power of death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70837" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Heb. 2:14</span>). Therefore, as the One who died as a serpent under God’s judgment, the Man-Savior dealt with the Devil and with his world, the satanic system. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="5xKEgdpuEwfEMeypKVJXxQKMqK2Fa2tvJZgq5hBR6INjxpLJ7ifzk23cJPGz7OALQ">The Firstborn of All Creation</h2><p data-content-id="NIP9vcQSpsaW9kg23JnrauOUIxlFrb3RZvwz6cWaDdxDBDLgKxxI62zDhQMwvPdhT"> When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He died as the Firstborn of all creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70838" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Col. 1:15</span>). With respect to His humanity, Christ was the first item of God’s creation. When He died on the cross, He died as this first item of the old creation. Hence, through His death on the cross the entire old creation was dealt with. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="tm_3_WpwudCvX6CkVoYA7s3M1GTBpy9OgG7uBMDbsNsUIce-CSAdVjV8DKlJDOLGv">The Peacemaker</h2><p data-content-id="hR1Jkh6fGpavWnsBVzKfDk6A95DtKL_27Gp4pGUAt4ZXghu0FgoVfq59grebM748A"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70839" data-verses="Ephesians 2:14-15">Ephesians 2:14 and 15</span> we see that Christ died as the Peacemaker, as the One who makes peace: “For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace.” Here we see that Christ died on the cross to abolish all the ordinances among mankind. In particular, He died to take away the partition between the Jews and the Gentiles. Not only was there a partition between Jews and Gentiles; there were also partitions between every nationality and race. Without the removal of these partitions, there would be no way for us to be one in the Lord Jesus as His Body. Praise the Lord that all the ordinances were abolished by the Man-Savior on the cross! Now in the church life we have people of all races, colors, and nationalities. </p>

The Lord died on the cross as a grain of wheat in order to release the divine life from within Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="462" id="462">[462]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="VnpGtuJZc2t4WkT0Rb_TqKQs9FrNE0CWBPCyIGrj5PYt8QUzResVcYufIW_qbioEP"> The New Testament reveals that the Lord Jesus died on the cross as seven items: the Lamb of God, a man in the flesh, a man of the old creation, the serpent, the Firstborn of creation, the Peacemaker, and a grain of wheat. This is not merely our word; this is what the Bible reveals. We need to proclaim the fact that, according to the Word of God, the Man-Savior died as these seven items. </p>

For example, if the king of a certain country were to die, a person with a twofold status—a man and a king—would die. As our Substitute, the Lord Jesus had a sevenfold status and therefore died as the Lamb of God, a man in the flesh, a man of the old creation, the serpent, the Firstborn of all creation, the Peacemaker, and a grain of wheat. Such an all-inclusive Person died an all-inclusive death. </p>
<p data-content-id="9ja0oN4pSUA1PfKrRQcCWxW84jNQuXvNrAFRd3n77So0-KjQ2N1zKueNosjiAaC8D"> Because the Lord’s death was all-inclusive, when He died on the cross many things were dealt with. Sin, sins, the flesh, the old man, Satan, the world, the old creation, and the ordinances were all dealt with. Furthermore, the divine life with the divine riches was released from within the Lord Jesus. His all-inclusive death took away all the negative things and released all the positive things. </p>

These cherubim represent the living creatures. This indicates that in His flesh Christ bore all the creatures. When the veil in the temple was torn, the cherubim embroidered on it were also torn. This means that when the flesh of Christ was crucified, all the creatures borne by Him were crucified as well. Through <span class="pg" data-page-id="463" id="463">[463]</span> the death of Christ sin, sins, the flesh, and all the creatures were all dealt with. </p>

After the Lord lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, working in His ministry for three and a half years, He was crucified and buried. If He had remained in the tomb, that would have meant that God did not justify what the Man-Savior was and what He did. However, the Man-Savior was resurrected. </p>

First, we are told that the Lord Jesus resurrected Himself, that is, that He raised Himself up. Speaking of His life, He said, “No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70854" data-verses="John 10:18">John 10:18</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70855" data-verses="John 2:19">John 2:19</span> the Lord said that He would raise up His body <span class="pg" data-page-id="466" id="466">[466]</span> in three days. The Lord Jesus had the power to die and to rise up from among the dead. Therefore, in one sense, He raised Himself up from the dead. On the other hand, the New Testament tells us that He was raised up by God. Concerning this, the Lord Jesus told the disciples that He would “be raised on the third day” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70856" data-verses="Matthew 16:21">Matt. 16:21</span>). Elsewhere the Lord said of Himself, “On the third day He shall be raised up” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70857" data-verses="Matthew 17:23">Matt. 17:23</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70858" data-verses="Acts 2:32">Acts 2:32</span> says, “This Jesus God raised up,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70859" data-verses="Acts 3:15">Acts 3:15</span> speaks of the Lord as the Author of life, “whom God raised from the dead.” Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70860" data-verses="Romans 6:4">Romans 6:4</span> Paul says, “Christ was raised from among the dead through the glory of the Father.” On the one hand, the Lord raised up Himself; on the other hand, He was raised from the dead by God. </p>

But God’s raising Him from among the dead was a sign that He was justified and vindicated by God. God raised Christ from the dead as a proof that He justified what the Lord was and what He did on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="IpVW-KDk2ZPgTnA3fCDrR5F6ISFzZIDAsieA6ADySAHJiaJ_KT5O4yrRjpf5t_Bzi"> The Man-Savior lived in a way that others thought strange. His way of living was absolutely different from religion, culture, and society. He lived and worked in a very unusual way. If God had not come in to raise Him up from the dead, this would have meant that God did not justify Him. But God’s raising Christ up from the dead was a sign of God’s justification and vindication. </p>
<p data-content-id="HjWwmoGOlsak0TUDWCi_sdlVb6Y9pPEtBKlHqojq6TpIxbKDnyfW41Pa33wfqt__Y"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70861" data-verses="Romans 4:25">Romans 4:25</span> says that Christ “was delivered because of our offenses and was raised because of our justification.” The death of Christ fulfilled and satisfied God’s righteous requirements so that we may be justified by God through His death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70862" data-verses="Romans 3:24">Rom. 3:24</span>). Christ’s resurrection is a proof that God was satisfied with His death for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IOLQFFycrPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW"> If Christ had died on the cross, having been judged there by God, but had not been raised from among the dead, there would have been no justification or vindication rendered to <span class="pg" data-page-id="467" id="467">[467]</span> Him by God. That would have affected our salvation because, in such a case, His death would not have been followed by God’s vindication. But God judged Christ in death and then raised Him up from the dead. God’s raising up Christ from the dead was His justification and vindication of what Christ was and did. From this we may have the assurance that God has accepted what Christ did for us on the cross. We are justified by God because of Christ’s death, and in Christ, the resurrected One, we are accepted before God. </p>

These five things caused the Lord Jesus to be put into the tomb. But when He came forth from the tomb in resurrection, this was His victory over the world, Satan, death, Hades, and the tomb. As Peter says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70863" data-verses="Acts 2:24">Acts 2:24</span>, “Whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it.” Because Christ is resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70864" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span>), death could not hold Him. It is impossible for death to hold resurrection; resurrection overcomes death. </p>

<p data-content-id="y695EWmpNHnEWPC-rqz1B1WJ3jSUoQBFyaZAx96FqVB_sFX0OYnWKsHhj6JUg1n-e"> The Lord’s divine nature, His divine being, was concealed and confined within His flesh. Through death the confinement of His humanity, His flesh, was broken, and then in resurrection He was released as the very God with His nature <span class="pg" data-page-id="468" id="468">[468]</span> and riches. Because He was released from the confinement of His flesh in resurrection, He was glorified. This was the reason the Lord said to the disciples on the way to Emmaus that it was necessary for Christ to suffer and enter into His glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70869" data-verses="Luke 24:26">Luke 24:26</span>). It was through His resurrection that He entered into glory. </p>

He was Christ in the flesh, but He has been transfigured into the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who essentially is the life-giving Spirit. Resurrection was His actual transfiguration. Before His death and resurrection, He was transfigured on the Mount of Transfiguration. However, that transfiguration was only temporary. His actual transfiguration was His resurrection, for in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit who imparts life into us. </p>

Just as His death was the termination of the old creation, so His resurrection was the germination of the new creation. What He terminated in His death He germinated in His resurrection. This germination includes us; we were regenerated through His resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70871" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>). Hence, His resurrection is our germination and regeneration. In this way we have become the new creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70872" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:17">2 Cor. 5:17</span>). We are regenerated people in His new creation. </p>

Therefore, the church is Christ’s reproduction in resurrection. When the Lord Jesus was incarnated, He was an individual. But when He was resurrected, He became corporate, a corporate Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70875" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:12">1 Cor. 12:12</span>), the Christ who is both the Head and the Body. <span class="pg" data-page-id="469" id="469">[469]</span> </p>

These matters are clearly revealed in the Acts and Epistles. We all need to know Christ’s resurrection to such an extent. </p>

It is difficult to say whether the two disciples went back to Jerusalem with the Lord or He went with them. In either case, they all journeyed together.

They could not understand how He could suddenly appear in the room. The door was closed, and no one opened it. Nevertheless, the Lord appeared with a physical body. </p>
<p data-content-id="5xKEgdpuEwfEMeypKUpXxSKMqK2Fa2tvJZgq5hBR6INjxpLJ7ifzk23cJPGz7OALQ"> The Lord Jesus said to the disciples, “Why are you troubled, and why are reasonings arising in your heart?

The place in His side that had been pierced with a spear could still be seen and touched. Not only was the Lord’s body visible and touchable, but He was able to eat food. “And while they still did not believe for joy and were marveling, He said to them, Do you have anything to eat here?

To bear fruit in life requires essentially the Spirit of life received through the breathing of the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="70933" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>).

Essentially, they had what they needed; economically, however, there was still a lack. Hence, they were to wait in Jerusalem until the Lord poured out upon them the promise of the Father, which was the promise of the economical Spirit. That promise was fulfilled in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70936" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span> on the day of Pentecost. After His ascension and enthronement, the Man-Savior poured out the economical Spirit upon the disciples, who had already become members of the Body of Christ essentially. What had been accomplished by the Lord in His resurrection was something essential. The disciples still needed to be equipped with the Spirit economically. This was accomplished by the Lord in His ascension. </p>

We have covered these matters in a brief way in certain of the foregoing messages, but we have not covered them adequately. First we shall consider Christ’s humanity, His living as the God-man. Hence, the title of this message is “The Man-Savior’s Incarnation Fulfilling the Purpose of God’s Creation of Man.” </p>
<p data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IOLQlF0PbPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW"> It is a great thing to see that Christ’s incarnation is linked to God’s purpose in creating man. This is a point that we have not covered fully in the past, although we have considered it briefly. We need to be impressed with the fact that the incarnation of Christ is closely related to the purpose of God in creating man. As we shall see, God’s purpose in the creation of man in His image and after His likeness was that man would receive Him as life and express Him in all His attributes. We shall also see that the Man-Savior’s incarnation brought God into man to restore and to recover the damaged and lost humanity and to express God in His attributes through human virtues. These matters are deep, profound, divine, and mysterious, and our words are limited in speaking of them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="484" id="484">[484]</span> </p>

God made this design in eternity past. It is a great matter that God designed man to be one with Him. Of course, in the Bible we cannot find the word “design” used with respect to man’s being one with God. Nevertheless, if we have an all-inclusive view of the revelation in the holy Word, we shall see that in eternity past God designed man to be one with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="zYdoNmJ8sJ3EfPJeHmXNjo7Y9_7RUWZfgnhUmVfdTB_5mEQTlpUx_z2KThQMh-S0-"> We may use the designing and building of a house as an illustration of God’s design concerning man. Before we build a house, we first need a design. Likewise, in the Bible we have both God’s design and His building. Throughout the Scriptures we have a complete revelation of God’s building. For His building God had a design. He designed to have man and that man should be one with Him. </p>

Two phrases in these verses have troubled teachers of the Bible: “in his own image” and “after our likeness.” What is God’s image? What is God’s likeness? What is the difference between image and likeness? Why are different prepositions used in relation to image and likeness? In other words, why does the Bible say that man was made <em>in</em> God’s image but <em>after</em> God’s likeness? Why does it not say that man was made after God’s image and in His likeness? If we study the Scriptures carefully, we shall be concerned with the difference between image and likeness and also realize that it is difficult to explain this difference. <span class="pg" data-page-id="485" id="485">[485]</span> </p>

This is the distinction made by Mary E. McDonough in <em>God’s Plan of Redemption.</em> Asking what is meant by image and likeness, she says, “These two words are not synonymous; the former word refers more especially to the invisible part of man—the inner-man—while the latter indicates the visible part, i.e., the outer-man or body. The inner-man was in some way created like God; we may reverently say, patterned after Him....” </p>
<p data-content-id="8rK9hZU17CqFQv_7f_cMeVDV076l38frJWrb3fYskUnsCbvB8WxSNVgXi8Bko75qT"> In the Life-study of Genesis we pointed out that man was created in the image of God inwardly and after the likeness of God outwardly (see Life-study of Genesis, Message 6, pp. 65-70). In that Life-study we said, “Man was created not only in the image of God inwardly, but also after the likeness of God outwardly. All the other items in creation are after ‘their kind.’ Man, however, is not after man’s kind, but after God’s likeness. As image indicates the inward being of God, so likeness must indicate the outward form of God” (pp. 69-70). We may say that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70993" data-verses="Genesis 1:26-27">Genesis 1:26 and 27</span> image refers to the inward being and likeness to the outward expression. In this message, without departing from what we have said in the past, we shall go on to consider in more detail the meaning of God’s creating man in His own image. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="0yMFLpTNFijhdJXKcBdsRUr0HDyobmW8BsYvNv_3Cioz9unzd69fVMg-p6C0n6Ifp">God’s Embodiment in Christ</h2><p data-content-id="7WKyJ1T_uHk5hAsLKQM1oL8FJj4I670thJCRuFLar2G9usySzvd5B-MQRqEDy9EDO"> In the Scriptures the word “image” is used to refer to God’s being. This can be proved by certain New Testament verses. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70994" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:4">Second Corinthians 4:4</span> says that Christ is the image of God, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70995" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Colossians 1:15</span> tells us that Christ is “the image of the invisible God,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70996" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span> reveals that Christ is “the effulgence of His glory and the express image of His substance.” Christ is the very embodiment of God. As God’s embodiment, Christ is God’s image. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="_ZwqsA5v5sK5Gd_CFtkVx8U-oyUvJZvrd4_dLBztnh2YyrGo-ZQKJ0rrkSkFZAXKk">Containing God and Becoming His Duplication</h2><p data-content-id="B-xax8NKp7LCijI7SvgMm-Jos3kSlmvYlicWUqjousBPGePPVlOH7nulgHhpJQvmR"> Furthermore, according to the Bible the image of God is related to His duplication. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70997" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> “image” is for God <span class="pg" data-page-id="486" id="486">[486]</span> to be duplicated, to be “copied” in man. This means that man was created in such a way that he could become God’s duplication, His copy. God created man in His own image with the intention that man would become His duplication. </p>
<p data-content-id="xdxTxFZ3QLG06tmoRbgOOKqoarNeZMRzYj39H4NLabyTJr4rWTMePzQvvgQ8LEOaY"> Since God created man for the purpose of man’s becoming His duplication, and since this purpose is indicated by the use of the word image, we may go on to say that the word image implies the capacity to contain God. If man did not have the capacity to contain God, how could he become God’s duplication, His copy? In order for man to be a copy of God, man must have the capacity or ability to contain what God is. </p>
<p data-content-id="rR_dpE6vYaDaPaCKn0FurjtGNcFtz_3rupQBp4xmcb2zrtZinaTEqSTzFHUuwqBbj"> This understanding of the image of God does not contradict the definition given in the Life-study of Genesis. To be sure, the image of God does refer to the inward being of God. It is no contradiction of this to go on to say that for God to create man in His image means that God created man with the intention that man would become a duplicate of God, and that the word image implies that man has the capacity and ability to take God into him and to contain Him. The man created in God’s image was created to be God’s container. Since man was made to be such a container, there was the need for him to have the capacity to receive God as his content and to contain this content. </p>

The word “likeness” refers to outward form, outward fashion, outward appearance. Hence, “likeness” here is a matter of expression. First, man was made in God’s image to be a duplicate of God, and then man was made after God’s likeness to have the appearance of God for His expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="K6HmpZJGTPRsiY1ak1-YCC534UlqtsBFDVHQgSo9S8is_l13ggA-7Yse3XgT2zYV3"> If man had only the likeness of God but not the image of God, this would mean that man would have only the outward appearance but not the inward reality. In such a case, the appearance, the expression, would be empty. The image is the inward reality of the outward expression, and the likeness is the expression, or the outward appearance, of the image. <span class="pg" data-page-id="487" id="487">[487]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="lXx03sAZnH1566ErN9Qk8KmN6YjVqHNC8OyUynANn47kviFgaPXvRFBN-BRclOuC0"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="70998" data-verses="Philippians 2:7">Philippians 2:7</span> is a New Testament verse related to this. In this verse we see that in His incarnation Christ became “in the likeness of men.” This verse tells us not that Christ had the likeness of God but that He had the likeness of men. When He became a man, He had the appearance, the expression, of man. However, this certainly was not an empty expression, an expression devoid of reality, an expression without content. On the contrary, Christ had both the reality of humanity and the expression, the appearance, of humanity. The reality of humanity was the content of the likeness of man that Christ had. </p>

Actually, God created man in His own image with the intention that man would be His duplication. Furthermore, for man to become a duplication of God, he must have the capacity to contain what God is.

Because this wonderful One was a composition of two essences, the mingling of God with man, He was a God-man. </p>

Contrary to what some may think, the Gospel of Luke is not merely a book of stories. This Gospel is a revelation of the God-man who lived a human life filled with the divine life as its content. As the One who lived such a life, the Man-Savior had the divine nature with the divine attributes, that is, with the divine love, light, righteousness, and holiness. The divine nature with its attributes was expressed in the Man-Savior’s human nature with all the human virtues. <span class="pg" data-page-id="493" id="493">[493]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="sd53dK7V3RACxeAhYYZarJvJWY7CXd4lKCZrOk5KHHUk8v9DyXsEuqfotQsdDEpDq">The Love of the God-man</h2><p data-content-id="whXJpCNVhaMbONnpNollLHbV78Gr88OYrW5ZYazISocRSVFEj93Rh6WuKCXo2tcws"> Because the Man-Savior’s divine nature with the divine attributes was expressed in His human nature with the human virtues, it is difficult to say when He was living on earth whether it was God loving others or a man loving. In the life of the Man-Savior we see a love that is the love of a God-man, the love of the One who lived a human life filled with the divine life. Because the Lord lived in this way, His love was the human virtue of love filled with the divine attribute of love. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lj54LQasZ-K8EIg0K8ABikZk1nfFprp5qpL9M39N7uxjTamFkVxVWNhxhdjVx7yWi"> Certain cases recorded in the Gospel of Luke illustrate the fact that the Man-Savior’s love was a love in which the attribute of divine love is expressed in the virtue of human love. We see this love in the case of the good Samaritan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71026" data-verses="Luke 10:25-37">Luke 10:25-37</span>), in the case of the sinful woman in the house of Simon the Pharisee (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71027" data-verses="Luke 7:36-50">7:36-50</span>), and in the case of the thief on the cross who asked the Lord Jesus to remember him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71028" data-verses="Luke 23:39-43">23:39-43</span>). In each case the Lord Jesus exercised a genuine human love. However, His love was not merely human; it was a human love filled with the divine love and also strengthened, uplifted, and enriched by the divine love. </p>
<p data-content-id="mFzvXUhbhqpISr0caDNgtiF1AZG80kf7bH6haSXLEJRmHfrjBcKo82-9Gg2bAZ_94"> In reading the Gospel of Luke, we may not see that with the Man-Savior we have human love filled, strengthened, uplifted, and enriched by the divine love. Readers of the New Testament can easily realize that the Lord Jesus loves others. Children are even taught to sing, “Jesus loves me, this I know.” But what kind of love does Jesus have? Is His love human or divine? His love is not merely human love nor merely divine love; His love is human love filled, strengthened, uplifted, and enriched by and with the divine love. This wonderful love is a composition, a mingling, of the divine love with the human love. This love was the living of the Man-Savior, the living of the God-man. The Lord’s living was a matter of the human virtues filled, strengthened, uplifted, and enriched by the divine attributes. </p>

He saved sinners by such a human-divine living, by a living that was humanly divine and divinely human. The living of the Lord Jesus was not merely human nor merely divine; it was humanly divine and divinely human. His living was the dynamic power by which He saved pitiful sinners. </p>
<p data-content-id="FyPO0Bs_RXrorVGaqa9dAqrFgpUWneMjMpEk0aYSfanBP0SA21ajMTzZdZb6Sdt3F"> If we understand this, we shall realize that the divine love merely by itself could not save us. Of course, mere human love could not save us. The love that saves us must be a composition of the human love and the divine love. The mingling of these two loves is a saving love. </p>
<p data-content-id="Cx-Kq8f_kufcXTjbL_AhK_V8OaHzT6d8wbuRcXv4ortX3gIXqwulpXeobzCQdoJJ1"> A living where the human life is filled with the divine life and the human virtues are strengthened and enriched by the divine attributes is what we have called the highest standard of morality. In the Gospel of Luke we see a life filled with human virtues that are strengthened, uplifted, and enriched by divine attributes. In such a living we see the composition, the mingling, of God with man. This living is both the saving power and the qualification of the Lord Jesus to be our Savior. In His status as a God-man the Man-Savior is qualified to save us. </p>
<p data-content-id="PIjOD0qFuTXceUSZrDmZAY8E0eeqSfaj3wRhOBw1FeXJDCmFaOPLe_ykOCcLaqUht"> As sincere Christians following the Lord Jesus, we need to know Him to the extent that we know Him as the One who lived a life in which the human virtues expressed the divine attributes. Our Man-Savior is such a man. Because He lived in this way, He was able and qualified to save us. </p>
<p data-content-id="-L1fy_zrwSJXUU5n5uXTTQxsvBf8gL-7zbw6oEqqqLY7uMvSfrnIP_SgjrRC490ZA"> This One, our Man-Savior, accomplished an all-inclusive death on the cross for our redemption. Then God raised Him from among the dead as God’s verification of and God’s sanction to His life and work.

In other words, the divine essence is God with all that He is. According to the Bible, what God is is revealed mainly in four aspects: love, light, righteousness, and holiness. God is love (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71040" data-verses="1John 4:8">1 John 4:8</span>). Love is God’s intrinsic nature. God is also light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71041" data-verses="1John 1:5">1 John 1:5</span>). Light is God’s shining, His expression. Love refers to what God is intrinsically within Himself, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="498" id="498">[498]</span> light refers to God’s expression. Holiness refers to God’s nature and righteousness to God’s way of doing things. According to the full revelation of the Scriptures, God is love and light, and He is also holy and righteous. These are the divine attributes, and the Man-Savior was conceived of God with these attributes. </p>
<p data-content-id="37AX-gTuAtUIfnNeLUqhy1VkDbtYWR3LTu6iLVxczyu6wYZF7FopoaS4d9S_W-BJ4"> The divine attributes are for the human virtues. The Man-Savior was conceived of God with the divine attributes for the content and reality of His human virtues. </p>
<p data-content-id="_ZwqsA5v5sK5Gd_CFuEVx-U-oyUvJZvrd4_dLBztnh2YyrGo-ZQKJ0rrkSkFZAXKk"> In understanding this, it is helpful to use the illustration of a glove. If a glove is not filled with a hand, the glove will be empty. The hand is both the content and reality of the glove. Only when the hand is put into the glove does the glove have content and reality. It is the hand in the glove that causes it to have content. Furthermore, when the hand moves, the glove also moves. The glove is designed to fit the hand, but it does not have life. It is the hand that causes the glove to move. When the hand moves, the hand within the glove will be expressed through the glove. </p>

Human love, for example, is a shell that should contain the divine love. Without containing the divine love, human love is merely an empty shell. The Man-Savior was conceived of God with the divine attributes in order to fill His human virtues. With Him the human virtues are not empty. However, with us the human virtues are empty. The reason the human virtues are not empty with Jesus Christ, the Man-Savior, is that His human virtues are filled with the divine attributes. <span class="pg" data-page-id="499" id="499">[499]</span> </p>

His virtues, however, might not have been strong and rich. But in the Lord Jesus, the second man, the human virtues are strong and rich. In Christ’s human love, for instance, there is strength. Because His human love is a strengthened, enriched love, it cannot be broken or defeated. The Lord’s love is rich because it has been filled with the divine attribute of love. Hence, His love is a mingled love, a composition of the human love with the divine love. </p>
<p data-content-id="K6HmpZJGTPRsiY1ak2eYBCZ34UlqtsBFDVHQgSo9S8is_l13ggA-7Yse3XgT2zYV3"> We may not have the concept that Christ’s incarnation was to fill, strengthen, and enrich the human virtues.

By the time of the Lord’s incarnation, the word “flesh” signified something that was not positive. Regarding the incarnation of Christ, the Bible says that He came in the <em>likeness</em> of the flesh of sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71044" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Rom. 8:3</span>). This means that when He became flesh, He came in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but did not have the nature of the flesh of sin. This is typified by the brass serpent in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71045" data-verses="Numbers 21:1">Numbers 21</span>. The brass serpent was in the form of a serpent, but it did not have the nature of a serpent. Likewise, when Christ became flesh, He had only the appearance of the flesh of sin; He did not have the nature of sinful flesh. After Christ became flesh, it was necessary for this flesh to be restored. </p>

This holy thing, however, was born into flesh. The “thing” was holy, but the flesh was not holy. However, the holy thing that was born into the flesh would sanctify, restore, flesh. Christ was conceived of the divine essence with the divine attributes to sanctify the human virtues. </p>
<p data-content-id="ov0pwXq8uOJOycOiA2KN9cWIpYzHGrTUx1Dbcc3jku5CrgeFN6HqgZR5btlLER604"> The incarnation is a mystery. Through incarnation God was born into man to produce a God-man. Not only was the Lord’s conception and birth a mystery, His human living for thirty-three and a half years was a mystery as well. The One who lived in Nazareth in the home of a carpenter was not merely a man; He was also God. A man with God in Him was working as a carpenter in Nazareth. What a mystery! </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="eZHFLAbNWwOTr1-IvtCDvzdBlkr6ZBJMGzugC7yI_anSHrEw64TAXVbz6cBzraKtb">RESCUING THE HUMAN VIRTUES FROM MAN’S FALL</h2><p data-content-id="5xKEgdpuEwfEMeypKXpX4AqMqK2Fa2tvJZgq5hBR6INjxpLJ7ifzk23cJPGz7OALQ"> The Man-Savior was born of the human essence with the human virtues in order to rescue these virtues from man’s fall. Before the Lord Jesus was born, man had become fallen. Therefore, with the exception of the Lord Jesus, the virtues of every human being are fallen. This was true even of the human virtues of Mary and Joseph. We do not agree with the Roman Catholic teaching that Mary did not have a sinful nature. (The doctrine of the sinlessness of Mary became an official teaching of the Roman Catholic Church in <span class="pg" data-page-id="504" id="504">[504]</span> 1854). This teaching has no basis in the Scriptures, and we do not believe it. </p>
<p data-content-id="NIP9vcQSpsaW9kg23LHrS--UIxlFrb3RZvwz6cWaDdxDBDLgKxxI62zDhQMwvPdhT"> In the Gospels, we can see the difference between the Man-Savior’s human virtues and those of Mary and Joseph. For example, the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71059" data-verses="Luke 2:1">Luke 2</span> indicates that the Lord’s virtues are high, pure, and perfect. When the Man-Savior was twelve, He said to His parents, who had been searching for Him, “Did you not know that I must be in the things of My Father?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71060" data-verses="Luke 2:49">2:49</span>). On the other hand, “He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71061" data-verses="Luke 2:51">2:51</span>). This was subjection in His humanity to His human parents. As we read this account, we see how excellent the human virtues of the Lord Jesus were. Mary’s virtues, by contrast, were not that excellent. As we compare these two kinds of human virtues, we see that the Lord’s virtues were uplifted, whereas Mary’s virtues were not strengthened, enriched, and uplifted by the divine attributes. From this we see that it certainly is necessary for the human virtues to be rescued from the fall. </p>

Because of the fall, our human virtues have been damaged. For example, the virtue of love has been damaged. A brother may love his wife very much one day, and the next day he may be unhappy with her and even think of divorcing her. This is a strong sign that his human love has been damaged. </p>
<p data-content-id="mFzvXUhbhqpISr0caAtguil1AZG80kf7bH6haSXLEJRmHfrjBcKo82-9Gg2bAZ_94"> The love a girl has for her mother is also a damaged love. A girl may be very loving toward her mother at one moment, but this love is easily broken and may suddenly change. This proves that a girl’s human love for her mother is a fallen and damaged love. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZOnBpaevoPlkI92KKJ2pCtDTUxvcifQzDL7AE4fhd-GIrB27yf8bZOWtB76IdtGDS"> The human virtues of righteousness and holiness have also been damaged by the fall. Our righteousness has so many “holes” in it that it can be compared to a beehive. Can <span class="pg" data-page-id="505" id="505">[505]</span> you count how many holes you have in your righteousness? Our love, brightness, righteousness, and holiness have all been damaged. </p>
<p data-content-id="AUNZZyVVAVOomKPrvSWiXUO12JhGBpIJR1Zd6ilPf-0XAUbPCWwsUR_yeQ_zGl6pN"> The Man-Savior’s incarnation was not only to rescue our virtues from the fall; His incarnation was also to restore and recover our virtues from the damage of the fall. Something may be rescued without being restored, or may be restored without being recovered. Our human virtues need to be rescued, restored, and recovered. </p>

Because our virtues were damaged and deformed, they could not match God’s attributes. But the uplifted human virtues can match God’s attributes. The Man-Savior was born of the human essence with the human virtues in order to uplift these virtues to such a standard that they can match God’s attributes for His expression. </p>

This morality is for the saving power of the Man-Savior’s dynamic salvation. The result of the divine attributes filling the empty human virtues, strengthening, enriching, and sanctifying the human virtues, and expressing God in the human virtues is the highest standard of morality. The Lord Jesus refers to this morality in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71062" data-verses="Matthew 5:20">Matthew 5:20</span>: “For I say to you, that unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.” Here the Lord charges us to have a surpassing righteousness, which is <span class="pg" data-page-id="506" id="506">[506]</span> not merely an objective righteousness, but a subjective righteousness, the indwelling Christ lived out of us as our righteousness. Of course, the Man-Savior Himself had such a surpassing righteousness, and this righteousness is the highest standard of morality. </p>
<p data-content-id="pQRuKAJlDonWZe7uWbxG1fCH2ZE-H030jYTeXH3ooRncRbKpIKHOqeYDJyj9C--Un"> Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71063" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">Philippians 3:9</span> speaks of the highest standard of morality: “And be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God based on faith.” Paul was endeavoring to be found in Christ not with his own righteousness, a human righteousness, but having the righteousness of God. This indicates that we Christians need to live a righteousness that is actually God Himself. Paul aspired to be found in Christ having such a surpassing righteousness, a righteousness of the highest standard, that is, the righteousness of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="vOVAPClIw9o-SMbO4PFlH3yn2shm1hmqQ-J4zvC1dCk_Dq1MQU0ZikmVpJu7Jramo"> How can we have the righteousness of God? We can only have this righteousness by having God live in us. If God does not live in us, we cannot live Him. If we do not live God, we cannot live the righteousness of God. To live the righteousness of God, we must have God Himself living in us. This is the surpassing righteousness, the righteousness of the highest standard. The Man-Savior’s incarnation was to produce this highest standard of morality, and this morality is for the saving power of His dynamic salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="WVNqXX68ZMdi0Is0N0SrCbWMw6vNnBJsEhQPV8kOVHacHdtLj25qcwOhqs0Rn3f7G"> Due to the influence of tradition, many Christians have the wrong concept concerning the Lord’s salvation. Their concept is that our Savior, Jesus Christ, came merely to save us from hell and to bring us to heaven. This understanding of salvation is very inadequate. The Man-Savior’s way of saving us is much higher than this. </p>
<p data-content-id="2tNCATtNEU-uXYvQuPA4ll3qLxK2yI2K223oVb_0w5iwpZu36YT9EiPenSev2WCos"> According to His way of saving us, the Man-Savior first brought God’s attributes into man’s virtues. Then He lived a life with the human virtues filled, strengthened, enriched, and sanctified by the divine attributes. In such a living there is saving power. The Lord does not save us by merely stretching out His hand to rescue us from hell. Rather, when He saves us, He comes into us as the One with the human <span class="pg" data-page-id="507" id="507">[507]</span> virtues filled with the divine attributes. Such a life saves us from within and uplifts our human virtues, restoring, sanctifying, and transforming us. A person who is saved in this way will surely not go to hell. Instead, he will go to the place where God is. </p>
<p data-content-id="uZQjh9ACdCObo73nFgamZLQDnu18yBYq6-Sf_S2e8ePelXrhqcHNu9IrQr-mDbhX0"> However, suppose a person could actually be saved according to the natural concept of merely being rescued from hell and brought to heaven. If Christ simply stretched forth His hand to lift us out of hell into heaven, God would not be pleased. He would say to such a person, “I am not happy with what you are. Your person is offensive to Me. I don’t want you to remain here in heaven with Me.” </p>

<p data-content-id="TNosbqa7UDYgYcvAEJM1nbJ_AhIjoMFZ1RknVLQVa51Kalz7wwEWcHnDTjWi7J3AL"> In order to save us, God had to live in a man for thirty-three and a half years. Have you ever thought about this? In creating the universe God used only six days, and on the seventh day He rested. Why, then, did God need to live on earth in a man for so many years in order to save us? Not only did the Lord become a man; He lived on earth as a man for thirty-three and a half years. </p>
<p data-content-id="O6A_Zpet8NpkAD12wzXVI9X96Jkgmribh2Ghh9n9QaeX9vJyetjJM0RwCL0BYvdJK"> Shortly after I was saved, I began to consider God’s way of saving us. I said to myself, “God is almighty. If He wanted to, He could save us by snatching us out of hell and bringing us to heaven. Why did He become a man and live on earth?” </p>
<p data-content-id="454lFLK2tydPg5el5HmBbdHpHQtD5QB0eD81SP4uSuDpX_AQORq44Je3A02kXbzxC"> The Lord’s human living was genuine. Genuine human living is found not with the upper class but with the middle and lower classes. The Lord Jesus did not live His human life as part of the upper class of society. Instead, He was a member of a poor family and worked as a carpenter, living in the lower class of society. Even though He was a royal descendant of the family of David, He was born into a poor <span class="pg" data-page-id="512" id="512">[512]</span> family and lived among the lower class for thirty years. At the age of thirty, He came forth to minister and ministered for three and a half years. </p>
<p data-content-id="ov0pwXq8uOJOycOiD0KN-c2IpYzHGrTUx1Dbcc3jku5CrgeFN6HqgZR5btlLER604"> Since God is almighty, why did He not save us in the same way He created the universe? In His creation, God simply had to speak, and a certain matter came into being. For example, He said, “Let there be light,” and there was light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71077" data-verses="Genesis 1:3">Gen. 1:3</span>). Concerning creation, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71078" data-verses="Psalms 33:9">Psalm 33:9</span> says, “He spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.” Since God created the heavens and the earth in this way, why was it necessary for Him to live on earth for thirty-three and a half years in order to save us? </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="37AX-gTuAtUIfnNeIWqh6nFkDbtYWR3LTu6iLVxczyu6wYZF7FopoaS4d9S_W-BJ4">The Application of Christ’s Redemption</h2><p data-content-id="Gn7ewN6nSdByHJgqhT3gXUUOe-1UTJncAcUqo6emH0AAxLxRlyu8isObL6a-GDD-q"> Another question we have concerns the application of Christ’s redemption. The Man-Savior accomplished redemption more than nineteen hundred years ago. Why did He not immediately apply this accomplished redemption to all His chosen people and thereby not give the enemy the opportunity to do so many evil things? </p>
<p data-content-id="crbZLnwlQe1t-R2NKGEjvLAIu5vZMDiBZWVp3fX5a8i7iFrksEzKqpk9CFqNeA0KZ"> Consider the situation from the time Christ accomplished redemption until now. Yes, Christianity has spread throughout the world, but actually there is little life. It seems that during the past nineteen centuries God has not accomplished very much. God has been working throughout the years, but there has been a great deal of opposition and attack. Satan, God’s enemy, has attacked God’s chosen people again and again. Why does this happen? Why did the Lord not apply His redemption immediately? If He did this, there might not be the need even for the millennium. After the application of redemption, everything would become new. There would be a new heaven, a new earth, and the New Jerusalem, where all God’s redeemed ones would be. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y58zRdwVwZdOug4OmsHYXzOi5YTN0tMwYIpE2xtAxeB5rWIwx_UI_h1Cxbmt9gLsn"> Have you ever considered matters such as these? Have you ever wondered why there is such a gap between the accomplishment of redemption and the application of redemption? I can testify that I have been thinking about these things for more than fifty years. <span class="pg" data-page-id="513" id="513">[513]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="EnWCv_eiedBm6acXcSwA0go36_MxGVx9OO_VMk3ydCyoMCmwj4AjjstBnWwxvP728">The Lord’s Human Living</h2><p data-content-id="DoAIPBJjBHkq_0FWd5DCgfupXz6H4o4mOlsgbBKk_d-ko1FGk9fqp5bptFLQcr1Cs"> At the beginning of my Christian life, I wondered why God did not save us in a fast way, in a way like His work in creation. When I asked my pastor about this, he told me that because we are human beings it was necessary for our Savior to become a man. In creation, of course, there was no need for God to become a man. But in salvation it certainly was necessary for Him to become a man. </p>
<p data-content-id="SlZ9LfzTj9oNzJ6-rbC1I6W-FtUqhJ-Hu1E2vmyVDkctfWDUrJm1vTh_wbOlz4rGj"> It was easier for God to create man than it was for Him to become a man. In creating man God had no difficulty; He simply did the work of creation. But God became involved with certain difficulties when He became a man. In His creation God merely did certain things. But in His salvation He not only did things—He became a man. </p>
<p data-content-id="gIbolEPmx05b9aaM5JtXd9j6mLMAfdyt6RkK1EfHgPUcUpUKFw_EQp0WLDUU4a_bg"> As I considered God’s incarnation for our salvation, I realized that it was logical for God to become a man in order to save us. But I still did not understand why He needed to live on earth for thirty-three and a half years. Why did He not become a man, stay on earth for a short period of time, perhaps a month, and then go to the cross to accomplish redemption? Why did He need to become a baby growing day by day? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71079" data-verses="Luke 2:40">Luke 2:40</span> says, “And the little child grew and became strong, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him.” Here we see that the Lord Jesus grew in a normal way; He did not grow to full stature in a short period of time. Furthermore, instead of preaching for only several days and then dying for our redemption, the Lord Jesus ministered for three and a half years before going to the cross to accomplish redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="eZHFLAbNWwOTr1-IsvSDqhtBlkr6ZBJMGzugC7yI_anSHrEw64TAXVbz6cBzraKtb"> In the four Gospels we have a lengthy record of the Lord’s life and ministry. The Gospel of Matthew, for example, contains twenty-eight chapters. Instead of simply telling that the Lord Jesus was born and that He died for our redemption and was resurrected, Matthew records many other matters. In the Gospels we see that the Man-Savior did not grow up miraculously; on the contrary, He grew up in a normal way. But why was this necessary? Because we were fallen and <span class="pg" data-page-id="514" id="514">[514]</span> sinful, we needed the Lord Jesus to die for us. He suffered a vicarious death for our salvation. But why did He need to suffer so many things during the thirty-three and a half years of His life? </p>
<p data-content-id="5xKEgdpuEwfEMeypJV5XySqMqK2Fa2tvJZgq5hBR6INjxpLJ7ifzk23cJPGz7OALQ"> Actually, only the last three hours on the cross were hours of vicarious suffering. During the first three hours He did not suffer vicariously. During the second period of three hours, God came in to judge the Man-Savior as our Substitute, “and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71080" data-verses="Luke 23:44">Luke 23:44</span>). Why, then, did He need to suffer during His first three hours on the cross, since that suffering was not for our sins? </p>
<p data-content-id="NIP9vcQSpsaW9kg20JXrZsuUIxlFrb3RZvwz6cWaDdxDBDLgKxxI62zDhQMwvPdhT"> For years I tried to find answers to these questions in books, but I failed to do so in full. Answers in full to these questions came only as a result of more than fifty years of personal, direct study of the Word, especially during the last ten years in which we have been carrying on the Life-study of the New Testament, a study that will be completed with the book of Acts. </p>

First, suppose God simply stretches forth His hand, snatches a sinner out of hell, and brings him to heaven. This way of saving a person would be easy. The second way, the way taken by God, is much more difficult. According to His way, God became a man and lived a human life on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="UwoI3MPYw_sWGgTUZT47WxlGshtzOQ5LUvhTMmv7LdK1FIytONjnEzyH0ZWFVMBnz"> Through His incarnation God brought the divine attributes into the human virtues, filling, restoring, recovering, sanctifying, and transforming them. Consider how much time it required for man’s virtues to be uplifted and transformed in this way. In His salvation, God does not simply snatch people out of hell and bring them into heaven. Rather, for our salvation the saving God became a man and lived the kind of life on earth that qualified Him to save us. This life also became the basic factor of the Man-Savior’s dynamic salvation. The procedure that qualified the Man-Savior required a long period of time. <span class="pg" data-page-id="515" id="515">[515]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Mixvss-j9tzRFTxytf58FbxNaqOl6bARPohV1ILcl2Rfd6ZbvrtmR-ZjJ-Sa8BhLR"> The first step of God’s salvation was to become a man, live on earth, die on the cross, and be resurrected. In the second step, the Man-Savior comes into the saved ones, lives in us, and grows in us, repeating His life in us. </p>

In order to be qualified to be man’s Savior, the Lord Jesus had to be a genuine man with a real human nature and the perfect human virtues. Because He is genuine as a man, real in His human nature, and perfect in His human virtues, He is qualified to be the Man-Savior. </p>

As the complete God, He had the true divine nature and the excellent divine attributes. <span class="pg" data-page-id="520" id="520">[520]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="vOVAPClIw9o-SMbO7NFlE3Sn2shm1hmqQ-J4zvC1dCk_Dq1MQU0ZikmVpJu7Jramo"> Orthodox theologians and fundamental Bible teachers agree that Christ is the complete God. However, some will not admit that this One is not only the Son of God but also the Father and the Spirit. On the one hand, they teach that Christ is the complete God; on the other hand, they teach that Christ is only part of the Trinity. Hence, with these theologians and teachers there is a contradiction. If you say that Christ is only part of the Trinity, then He is not the complete God. Rather, He is simply a part of the complete God. The complete God is not merely the Father or merely the Spirit or merely the Son. The complete God is the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="WVNqXX68ZMdi0Is0O2SrBb2Mw6vNnBJsEhQPV8kOVHacHdtLj25qcwOhqs0Rn3f7G"> We would emphasize the fact that the Man-Savior is both a genuine man and the complete God. He is a genuine man with the real human nature and the perfect human virtues, and He is the complete God with the true divine nature and the excellent divine attributes. We have seen that with respect to His humanity the Man-Savior is genuine, real, and perfect. Now we need to see that with respect to His divinity He is complete, true, and excellent. He is the complete God, He has the true divine nature, and He has the excellent divine attributes. His human virtues are perfect, but His divine attributes are excellent; His attributes are superior, surpassing. </p>
<p data-content-id="2tNCATtNEU-uXYvQtNA4mkXqLxK2yI2K223oVb_0w5iwpZu36YT9EiPenSev2WCos"> The Man-Savior’s divine nature and excellent divine attributes empower and ensure His ability to save man. In His humanity there is the capacity to save us, the capacity for salvation. But this capacity is empowered and ensured by His divinity. His ability to save us is guaranteed by His divinity. </p>
<p data-content-id="uZQjh9ACdCObo73nGiamaKwDnu18yBYq6-Sf_S2e8ePelXrhqcHNu9IrQr-mDbhX0"> When some hear that the Man-Savior’s divine nature and attributes empower and ensure His ability to save us, they may say, “Is there any verse in the Bible that says this? Have you read a book that teaches this?” I must answer both questions with a no. Apparently, there is not a verse in the Bible that teaches this, and I have never read a book that uses these expressions. Perhaps you are wondering why I have the boldness to speak this way. My answer is that this kind of teaching is the result of more than a half century of the study of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="521" id="521">[521]</span> Bible. In particular, it is the result of a ten-year Life-study of the New Testament, a study that will soon be completed with the book of Acts. According to the divine revelation in the Scriptures, the Man-Savior’s divine nature and divine attributes empower and ensure His saving ability. The Bible as a whole certainly reveals that the Lord’s divinity empowers His saving capacity, which is in His humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="f5f0VDzn9jkRQSn1Jy1f8bRwlK3eq6Siv45D3Z1PVOSaG41wTyIuG2c1MeKQAjvFj"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71096" data-verses="1John 1:7">First John 1:7</span> conveys the thought that the divinity of Christ empowers and ensures the saving capacity within His humanity. This verse says, “The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.” Here the name “Jesus” denotes the Lord’s humanity, which is needed for the shedding of the redeeming blood, and the title “His Son” denotes the Lord’s divinity, which is needed for the eternal efficacy of the redeeming blood. Thus, “the blood of Jesus His Son” indicates that this blood is the proper blood of a genuine man for redeeming God’s fallen creatures with divine surety for its eternal efficacy, an efficacy that is all-prevailing in space and everlasting in time. </p>
<p data-content-id="IpVW-KDk2ZPgTnA3cDTrR4F6ISFzZIDAsieA6ADySAHJiaJ_KT5O4yrRjpf5t_Bzi"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71097" data-verses="1John 1:7">1 John 1:7</span>, the blood shed by the Man-Savior on the cross was not only the blood of Jesus but also the blood of the Son of God. It was the blood of one with a dual status, the status of both man and God. The blood of Jesus was the genuine blood of a real man required for our redemption. The efficacy of this blood is ensured by the Man-Savior’s divinity. Divinity makes the blood of Jesus eternal. Apart from the Lord’s divinity, His redemption could not be eternal. </p>
<p data-content-id="HjWwmoGOlsak0TUDVDy_selVb6Y9pPEtBKlHqojq6TpIxbKDnyfW41Pa33wfqt__Y"> The Lord’s true divinity with His excellent attributes empowers and ensures His ability to save man. Humanity qualifies Him to save us, and divinity empowers Him to save us. His divinity also ensures His ability to save man. </p>

He has the human nature with its virtues to <span class="pg" data-page-id="522" id="522">[522]</span> contain God and express Him. No one has ever contained as much of God as the Lord Jesus does. With His human virtues He contained God and expressed Him. In the Olympic games athletes try their best to display their ability. But the God-man did not need to exert Himself to display His ability to contain and express God. No one can compare with Him in having the human nature with its virtues to contain and express God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="zYdoNmJ8sJ3EfPJeEnnNgobY9_7RUWZfgnhUmVfdTB_5mEQTlpUx_z2KThQMh-S0-">Having the Divine Nature with Its Divine Attributes to Be His Content and Reality<br/>for the Expression of God</h2><p data-content-id="aJBHB16Du0i39s63o9746nfcHmEpg--JpExe5woWN23707a7BR6E28G078JPrLzJy"> As the God-man the Lord Jesus has the divine nature with its divine attributes to be His content and reality for the expression of God. The God-man has the essence of God, the nature of God, and the attributes of God. He is a genuine man with the real human nature and the perfect human virtues to express God. However, in order to express God, He must have God as His content and reality. Once again we may use the illustration of a glove. A glove expresses the hand. But if a glove is to express the hand, it must have the hand as its content and reality. The God-man is both the “glove” and the “hand,” for He has both humanity as the container and divinity as the content. </p>
<p data-content-id="baXaoDjM31g4vdogMO4_AnJsY6kl2rRDOpin976WeiNY5gEGyluhr_T3XIAmn92Sv"> Today the Man-Savior is still both man and God. He is man as the container, and He is God as the content. In Him we have the real human nature and the true divine nature. In Him we have the perfect human virtues and the excellent divine attributes. These two categories meet in Him and are mingled in Him to become one composition. Hence, He is the God-man. </p>
<p data-content-id="qMcyXCf9JxgO6C4J6XPI18utWR45eDmy97SasR1HjYltLhBmhnwtFer_oxArsFU1X"> However, in this mingling there is not the producing of a third nature, a nature that is neither fully human nor completely divine. Furthermore, after the essences of the two natures, the divine nature and the human nature, have been mingled and have become one composition, they still remain distinct. This means that in the mingling of divinity and humanity in the Man-Savior there is no confusion of <span class="pg" data-page-id="523" id="523">[523]</span> the two natures. This mingling is mysterious; this God-man is truly a mystery. </p>
<p data-content-id="y695EWmpNHnEWPC-orj1B0WJ3jSUoQBFyaZAx96FqVB_sFX0OYnWKsHhj6JUg1n-e"> When I was young, I did not receive this kind of help in understanding the Lord Jesus as the God-man. I am thankful that the young saints are able to receive this help today. The young generation in the Lord’s recovery is very blessed to hear such a word concerning the God-man, the Man-Savior, with His human nature and His divine nature. </p>

Then in His resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71113" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>). How did Christ become a life-giving Spirit in His resurrection? Notice that we are not asking why He became a life-giving Spirit, but how, in what way, He became a Spirit. The answer to this question is that the Man-Savior became a life-giving Spirit with a wonderful, all-inclusive qualification. The Lord Jesus was both God and man. For thirty-three and a half years He lived the life of a God-man; that is, He lived a human life by the divine life for the expression of God. After living this kind of life, He died on the cross as the all-inclusive One. </p>
<p data-content-id="IpVW-KDk2ZPgTnA3cDjrZrV6ISFzZIDAsieA6ADySAHJiaJ_KT5O4yrRjpf5t_Bzi"> Whenever a living thing dies, the death of that thing corresponds to its nature. For example, a dog dies a dog death. Likewise, an ant dies an ant death, and a fly dies a fly death. This principle also applies to human beings. An unknown person may die an insignificant death, but a great person dies a great death. The Lord Jesus was the all-inclusive One; <span class="pg" data-page-id="528" id="528">[528]</span> therefore, He died an all-inclusive death. After His all-inclusive death, the Lord was resurrected by God. It was in this condition with such a qualification that He became a life-giving Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="DoAIPBJjBHkq_0FWd5jCgdupXz6H4o4mOlsgbBKk_d-ko1FGk9fqp5bptFLQcr1Cs">THE EXTRACT OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="SlZ9LfzTj9oNzJ6-rbi1I4W-FtUqhJ-Hu1E2vmyVDkctfWDUrJm1vTh_wbOlz4rGj"> The life-giving Spirit is actually an extract of the all-inclusive Christ. As we have pointed out elsewhere (see <em>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John,</em> p. 2), an extract may be defined as liquid extracted from a plant or other organic matter and that contains its essence in concentrated form. A synonym for extract is “spirit,” which is the essence of a substance extracted in liquid form. Wine, for example, may be regarded as an extract, or spirit, of grapes. Whenever we extract the essence of a particular substance, we get the spirit of that substance. Furthermore, an extract of something will always include the essence, elements, and substance of that thing. Suppose, for instance, that we have the extract of an orange. This extract will comprise the essence, the elements, the nature, and the substance of that orange. In a similar way, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit comprises all that Christ is, all that He went through, and all that He accomplished, attained, and obtained. </p>
<p data-content-id="gIbolEPmx05b9aaM5JNXe9D6mLMAfdyt6RkK1EfHgPUcUpUKFw_EQp0WLDUU4a_bg"> Many Christians do not realize that the Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71114" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">Philippians 1:19</span> Paul speaks of “the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.” Here Paul does not speak of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of God, but of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71115" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">Philippians 1:19</span> the Spirit of God has become the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This is “the Spirit” mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71116" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span>. This is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord’s incarnation, but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord’s resurrection, compounded with the Lord’s humanity, human living under the cross, crucifixion, and resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="eZHFLAbNWwOTr1-IsvyDphNBlkr6ZBJMGzugC7yI_anSHrEw64TAXVbz6cBzraKtb"> What is your understanding of Jesus and of Christ? Jesus is both the complete God and a genuine man.

As the God-man, Jesus was the complete God with the true divine nature and with excellent divine attributes, and a genuine man with a real human nature and with perfect human virtues. </p>
<p data-content-id="5xKEgdpuEwfEMeypJVZXxTKMqK2Fa2tvJZgq5hBR6INjxpLJ7ifzk23cJPGz7OALQ"> Who, then, is Christ? Christ is the God-anointed Jesus passing through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. In resurrection Jesus Christ became an extract of Himself, and this extract is the life-giving Spirit. Because this life-giving Spirit is the extract of the all-inclusive Christ, this Spirit also is all-inclusive. </p>
<p data-content-id="NIP9vcQSpsaW9kg20J3ratOUIxlFrb3RZvwz6cWaDdxDBDLgKxxI62zDhQMwvPdhT"> Christ’s becoming the life-giving Spirit is related to the reproduction of the God-man. How can the God-man be reproduced? The answer to this question is that the God-man is reproduced by the all-inclusive Spirit. Seeing this, we now need to find out in what way the God-man is reproduced by the all-inclusive Spirit. </p>

The Lord Jesus spoke about regeneration to Nicodemus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71119" data-verses="John 3:1">John 3</span>. To this ethical, cultured, and religious gentleman, He said, “You must be born anew” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71120" data-verses="John 3:7">John 3:7</span>). To be born anew, or again, is to be born of another essence, the divine essence. The Lord seemed to be saying to Nicodemus, “You were born of the human essence, and now you need to be born of another essence—the essence of God. Nicodemus, you must be born of God.” </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71123" data-verses="John 3:6">John 3:6</span> the Lord Jesus says, “That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” If we would have the divine life, we must be born of the Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71124" data-verses="John 3:14-15">John 3:14 and 15</span> the Lord Jesus goes on to say, “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that every one who believes in Him may have eternal life.” Here the Lord refers to Himself as the crucified and resurrected Christ. Whoever believes in Him will have eternal life. Having eternal life is equal to being reborn. In other words, to be reborn is to have the divine life. </p>
<p data-content-id="iKUb-yZjUMq0U5rbNwGQVPCKhlmsitCl_HgCC1JygvKdbgTH8NQIWMexx8ZGM2f34"> What does it mean to be born again, to be born of the Spirit? To be born of the Spirit is to receive the divine life. In these verses from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71125" data-verses="John 3:1">John 3</span> we first have the Spirit and then the crucified and resurrected Son of Man. As we compare these verses we see that here the Spirit is the extract of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="10Y2CNEKWaUAkDvQxkMa81LffZ6_98e4N8ozCPPMzkmQPd2gHT1E_ldnAuur5g5vG"> The Spirit of whom we are born to have eternal life is the extract of the crucified and resurrected Christ. Crucifixion is a “pressing” that produces an extract. When pressure is applied to an orange, we get the juice as the extract of the orange. We may compare the crucifixion of Christ to the pressing of an orange. When Christ was on the cross, He was “pressed.” After being pressed on the cross, He came forth as the “juice” of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. Furthermore, just as the essence, elements, nature, and substance of an orange are in the extract, so the essence, elements, nature, and substance of Christ are in the all-inclusive Spirit. It is by this Spirit that Christ, the God-man, is reproduced. </p>

Since God has poured out His Spirit, what people need to do in order to be saved is to call on the name of the Lord.

In this message we shall go on to see that for this reproduction we also need to be transformed by the pneumatic Christ in our soul and then live Christ as the God-man. </p>

We need to be transformed by the pneumatic Christ in our soul with His divine attributes to uplift, strengthen, enrich, and fill our human virtues for His expression in our humanity. Concerning this, Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71140" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17-18">2 Corinthians 3:17 and 18</span>, “The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.” Both “the Spirit” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71141" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">verse 17</span> and “the Lord Spirit” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71142" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">verse 18</span> refer to the pneumatic Christ. As we behold and reflect Him, we are being transformed into His image. Furthermore, the Lord Spirit is actually the Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71143" data-verses="John 3:6">John 3:6</span>. The Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71144" data-verses="John 3:6">John 3:6</span> is for regeneration, and the Lord the Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71145" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span> is for transformation. To be regenerated, reborn, is a <span class="pg" data-page-id="536" id="536">[536]</span> once-for-all matter, but to be transformed is a life-long matter. Hence, Paul says that we are “being transformed.” The word “being” indicates a process. We are undergoing the process of being transformed. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="8rK9hZU17CqFQv_7c-MMWGzV076l38frJWrb3fYskUnsCbvB8WxSNVgXi8Bko75qT">A Metabolic Salvation</h2><p data-content-id="HjWwmoGOlsak0TUDVDS_sclVb6Y9pPEtBKlHqojq6TpIxbKDnyfW41Pa33wfqt__Y"> It is rather easy to understand the meaning of regeneration, but it is not easy to understand the meaning of transformation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71146" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span> the King James Version even uses the word “changed” instead of “transformed.” The use of “changed” in this verse is not adequate. Although transformation is a change, it involves more than a mere outward change. Transformation involves a metabolic change, an inward change in life. Such a metabolic change requires the working within us of the element of the divine life. This produces a change not only in appearance and behavior, but also a change in life, nature, and intrinsic essence. </p>
<p data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IOIR1FydrPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW"> We should not think that the Lord saves us merely in an objective way. We should not expect that the more we pray, the more the Lord will save us from the heavens objectively. On the contrary, the more we call on the name of the Lord, the more He moves within us to cause a metabolic change that affects our intrinsic being. This means that the Lord’s salvation is a metabolic salvation, not merely a salvation of outward activity. It is easy to do something outward, but to save us metabolically takes time. What is revealed concerning divine salvation in the New Testament is not merely a salvation of action; it is primarily a salvation of metabolism. From experience we know that this metabolic salvation is slow, gradual, and steady. </p>

<p data-content-id="zYdoNmJ8sJ3EfPJeEnHNjp7Y9_7RUWZfgnhUmVfdTB_5mEQTlpUx_z2KThQMh-S0-"> Regeneration and transformation are two steps in the process to reproduce the God-man. The Man-Savior as the God-man is the unique prototype. God intends to reproduce, or mass produce, this prototype through regeneration and transformation. This reproduction takes place by the regeneration of the pneumatic Christ in our spirit and through the transformation by this same pneumatic Christ in our soul. Through these steps we become the reproduction of the God-man. This reproduction is the mass production of the unique prototype. Praise the Lord that we have been regenerated once for all and that we are now in the process of being transformed! </p>

Christ lived on earth as a God-man for thirty-three and a half years. Today we, His reproduction, should live Him as the God-man. </p>
<p data-content-id="qMcyXCf9JxgO6C4J6XvI28OtWR45eDmy97SasR1HjYltLhBmhnwtFer_oxArsFU1X"> Christians often quote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71149" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Philippians 1:21a</span>: “For to me to live is Christ.” Paul’s life was to live Christ. Christ was not only his life within but also his living without. He lived Christ because Christ lived in him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71150" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>). He was one with Christ both in life and in living. He and Christ had one life and one living. They lived together as one person. Christ lived within him as his life, and he lived Christ without as His living. </p>
<p data-content-id="y695EWmpNHnEWPC-orD1C32J3jSUoQBFyaZAx96FqVB_sFX0OYnWKsHhj6JUg1n-e"> An important matter for us to realize is that the Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71151" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Philippians 1:21</span> is the God-man. This can be proved by Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71152" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">chapter two</span> of Philippians. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71153" data-verses="Philippians 2:5">2:5</span> Paul says, “Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.” Then Paul goes on to say in the following verses that Christ subsisted in the form of God, but did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped. Instead, He emptied Himself taking the form of a slave and becoming in the likeness of men (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71154" data-verses="Philippians 2:6-7">vv. 6-7</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71155" data-verses="Philippians 2:8">verse 8</span> Paul continues his description of this God-man: “And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.” From this description we see that <span class="pg" data-page-id="538" id="538">[538]</span> the Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71156" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">Philippians 1</span> is the God-man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71157" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">Philippians 2</span>. Therefore, to live Christ is to live the God-man. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="8rK9hZU17CqFQv_7c-MMeWDV076l38frJWrb3fYskUnsCbvB8WxSNVgXi8Bko75qT">By the Bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ</h2><p data-content-id="0yMFLpTNFijhdJXKfANsSVL0HDyobmW8BsYvNv_3Cioz9unzd69fVMg-p6C0n6Ifp"> We live Christ as the God-man by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71158" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">Phil. 1:19</span>). We have seen that the Spirit of Jesus Christ is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord’s incarnation, but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord’s resurrection, compounded with His incarnation, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. The Spirit of Jesus is mainly for the Lord’s humanity and human living; the Spirit of Christ is mainly for the Lord’s resurrection. To experience the Lord’s humanity, as illustrated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71159" data-verses="Philippians 2:5-8">Philippians 2:5-8</span>, we need the Spirit of Jesus. To experience the power of the Lord’s resurrection, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71160" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Philippians 3:10</span>, we need the Spirit of Christ. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71161" data-verses="Philippians 2:5-8">Philippians 2:5-8</span> Paul encourages us to take the mind of Jesus Christ, the God-man. This is the mind that was in Christ when He emptied Himself taking the form of a slave, and humbled Himself, being found in fashion as a man. To have such a mind requires us to be one with Christ in His inward parts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71162" data-verses="Philippians 1:8">Phil. 1:8</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="B-xax8NKp7LCijI7RuwMl8pos3kSlmvYlicWUqjousBPGePPVlOH7nulgHhpJQvmR"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71163" data-verses="Philippians 2:12-13">Philippians 2:12-13</span> Paul goes on to say, “So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only as in my presence, but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.” The salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71164" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">verse 12</span> is not salvation from hell. Salvation from hell is not something that can be worked out by us. The salvation here is a subjective salvation, an inward salvation that requires our cooperation with God. We cooperate through our obedience. Our obedience is our cooperation. </p>
<p data-content-id="xdxTxFZ3QLG06tmoSawOOLqoarNeZMRzYj39H4NLabyTJr4rWTMePzQvvgQ8LEOaY"> To work out our salvation is to carry it out, to bring it to the ultimate conclusion. We have received God’s salvation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="539" id="539">[539]</span> Now we need to carry out this salvation, to bring it to its ultimate conclusion, by our constant and absolute obedience with fear and trembling. We have received this salvation by faith. Now we must carry it out by obedience. To receive salvation by faith is once for all; to carry out salvation by obedience is life long. </p>
<p data-content-id="rR_dpE6vYaDaPaCKk1VuritGNcFtz_3rupQBp4xmcb2zrtZinaTEqSTzFHUuwqBbj"> The word “for” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71165" data-verses="Philippians 2:13">verse 13</span> gives the reason we need to obey always. We should obey because God operates in us. We have God operating in us both the willing and the working to carry out our salvation. It is not that we by ourselves work out our salvation, but that God operates in us to do it. The only thing we need to do is to obey God as the One who operates in us the willing and the working for His good pleasure. </p>

On the Sabbath day in the synagogue at Nazareth, He read from the book of Isaiah and proclaimed the acceptable year of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71191" data-verses="Luke 4:16-21">4:16-21</span>). This acceptable year is the New Testament age of grace typified by the year of jubilee (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71192" data-verses="Leviticus 25:8-17">Lev. 25:8-17</span>), the fiftieth year in which all the slaves were liberated and every man’s inheritance was restored to him. Beginning with this message, we shall consider further the jubilee. In this message and in the message following we shall give a definition of the jubilee. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="QS_uuvFcVjx6uGVtJu-BfQgnlYKY1jnXQkbZwmBnmy1XcRsI7z2kVs1C7kIjs7vSf">THE PROCLAMATION OF GOD’S REDEMPTION</h2><p data-content-id="K6HmpZJGTPRsiY1an1eYIRZ34UlqtsBFDVHQgSo9S8is_l13ggA-7Yse3XgT2zYV3"> The word “jubilee” is anglicized from the Hebrew word <em>yobel.</em> This Hebrew word denotes the blast of a horn, specifically the signal of a silver trumpet. Hence, the word came to signify the instrument itself and the festival thus introduced. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71193" data-verses="Leviticus 25:9">Leviticus 25:9</span> says, “Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.” </p>
<p data-content-id="lXx03sAZnH1566ErO9wk3ZWN6YjVqHNC8OyUynANn47kviFgaPXvRFBN-BRclOuC0"> We have seen that <em>yobel</em> refers specifically to the blasting of a silver trumpet. In typology silver signifies redemption. Hence, the blasting of a silver trumpet indicates the trumpeting of God’s redemption. The Hebrew word <em>yobel,</em> anglicized jubilee, refers to the blast of a horn, the instrument itself, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="546" id="546">[546]</span> finally to the festival introduced by the blasting of a silver trumpet. </p>
<p data-content-id="UwoI3MPYw_sWGgTUZS47VwFGshtzOQ5LUvhTMmv7LdK1FIytONjnEzyH0ZWFVMBnz"> The basic thought concerning the jubilee is that it is the sounding out of God’s redemption. The blasting of the silver trumpet was a proclamation of redemption. It was a proclamation based on God’s redemption and also a sounding out of this redemption. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Mixvss-j9tzRFTxyte58GaRNaqOl6bARPohV1ILcl2Rfd6ZbvrtmR-ZjJ-Sa8BhLR">THE RELEASE OF PEOPLE AND POSSESSIONS</h2><p data-content-id="VnpGtuJZc2t4WkT0SaPTpLws9FrNE0CWBPCyIGrj5PYt8QUzResVcYufIW_qbioEP"> This sounding out, this proclamation, of God’s redemption was not the proclaiming of any commandment or requirement. On the contrary, it was a proclamation of freedom, of release. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71194" data-verses="Leviticus 25:10">Leviticus 25:10</span> says, “And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.” Here we see that the proclamation of release or liberty was related to people and to their possessions. Regarding every human being we need to consider the person himself and his possessions. Therefore, the release proclaimed for the jubilee affected the Israelites and their possessions. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="iKUb-yZjUMq0U5rbNxmQWPiKhlmsitCl_HgCC1JygvKdbgTH8NQIWMexx8ZGM2f34">Man’s Economic Needs</h2><p data-content-id="10Y2CNEKWaUAkDvQxlsa_0rffZ6_98e4N8ozCPPMzkmQPd2gHT1E_ldnAuur5g5vG"> The study of political methods has been going on for thousands of years. Those who study politics know that if someone is to rule others, the first thing he must do is take care of feeding them. In other words, a ruler must manage the economy well. If the people do not have food, they will rise up against those ruling them. </p>
<p data-content-id="9ja0oN4pSUA1PfKrSRsCVx284jNQuXvNrAFRd3n77So0-KjQ2N1zKueNosjiAaC8D"> An important issue in the election of any president of the United States is whether a particular candidate can provide jobs and insure a proper standard of living. A good president must be able to meet this need. For example, Roosevelt became president during the great depression. Because he changed the economic situation of the country, he is regarded by many as a great president. Some claim that Roosevelt was <span class="pg" data-page-id="547" id="547">[547]</span> great not merely in political affairs but in uplifting the living standard of the American people. </p>
<p data-content-id="jXdlQ8xxZMxS77oeG_ss33PSEOMlQ9s1jH8YQMk7cEhKguIbR9jLLFm6wFfxpAM7f"> The point we are making here is that if any politician or statesman is to be successful he must find a way to improve the living of the people. The more successful a political leader is in this, the longer he will be able to remain in office. The political leaders who are respected most by the people are those who have the ability to improve the level of daily life. </p>
<p data-content-id="TNosbqa7UDYgYcvAEIM1vIZ_AhIjoMFZ1RknVLQVa51Kalz7wwEWcHnDTjWi7J3AL"> Because of man’s economic needs, especially the need for food, certain “isms” have developed. These “isms” include communism, capitalism, and socialism. According to communism, economic resources should be held in common, land should not belong to certain property owners, and social wealth should not belong to the capitalists. Communism teaches that something should be done to balance the wealth. In some countries taxation is used as a means of balancing wealth. In these countries a person may earn a great deal of money, but much of it must be given to the government in taxes. Socialism is also concerned with man’s economic needs. Statesmen and philosophers have tried their best to find ways to meet man’s need for food. However, the more “isms” they have invented, the more the people have suffered. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="nV3M-hxr_PahH5f0CPXBPOrmHTm7hkZMtOU1wXRdLUKzbd2Rwvo4ANlkJXwIqXfdH">The Basic Concern in the Jubilee</h2><p data-content-id="6v5bqSZVkxM1HMGlWOheNrm8O5Ww8o25b4qVQMP5MlzkvkTR8-sJeZYdiAzVYImAy"> In the jubilee portrayed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71195" data-verses="Leviticus 25:1">Leviticus 25</span> the main thought is how to take care of people’s living. In other words, the basic concern is man’s enjoyment. The primary enjoyment in human life is to be filled with good food. A person whose stomach is empty will not appreciate money or material riches. He would rather have food to fill his stomach. Suppose a rich man who owns a luxury car is starving. Do you think he will be able to enjoy his car? No, he would gladly trade his car for food. Humanly speaking, the jubilee is concerned with taking care of our eating, with filling our stomach. </p>
<p data-content-id="RZzGEogxd1MGIsl2eYZkq2CHSdLcm5J3IdyqcTX_a5S28-G-Yz8OH2qUTV12ioiQD"> Although God is very different from worldly politicians and has not taught man any “isms,” we may say that He is a <span class="pg" data-page-id="548" id="548">[548]</span> “great statesman.” The jubilee was ordained by God as the divine statesman. </p>
<p data-content-id="sd53dK7V3RACxeAhbYpaoIPJWY7CXd4lKCZrOk5KHHUk8v9DyXsEuqfotQsdDEpDq"> God ordained that His people be given the good land of Canaan. This land was allotted to the twelve tribes of Israel. Eventually, each family received an allotment of land as a possession. The land was not mainly to be for their living or their lodging; the land was primarily for their eating. </p>
<p data-content-id="whXJpCNVhaMbONnpOoVlIF7V78Gr88OYrW5ZYazISocRSVFEj93Rh6WuKCXo2tcws"> The need for food is greater than the need for lodging. One may live in the wilderness for a long time without a house, but he could not live very long without eating. The good land, therefore, was given to God’s people for their eating. This is the reason the Bible refers to this land as “a land flowing with milk and honey.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Lj54LQasZ-K8EIg0J8wBhm5k1nfFprp5qpL9M39N7uxjTamFkVxVWNhxhdjVx7yWi"> The good land was not called a land of gold. What good would it be to have a land that could provide gold but could not provide food? God created the land not for man to have gold but for man to have food. The land is for food. </p>
<p data-content-id="mFzvXUhbhqpISr0cZD9gtjF1AZG80kf7bH6haSXLEJRmHfrjBcKo82-9Gg2bAZ_94"> Milk and honey signify that the good land is rich in food. Some countries may have wheat and corn but no milk and honey. The good land is a land flowing with milk and honey. Both milk and honey are produced by the mingling of two lives—the vegetable life and the animal life. This mingling of the animal life with the vegetable life signifies the riches of the land. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ZOnBpaevoPlkI92KJKmpBsjTUxvcifQzDL7AE4fhd-GIrB27yf8bZOWtB76IdtGDS">The Loss and Return of the Land</h2><p data-content-id="AUNZZyVVAVOomKPrsRGiUUu12JhGBpIJR1Zd6ilPf-0XAUbPCWwsUR_yeQ_zGl6pN"> Because God brought His people into the good land and allotted a portion of the land to every family, each family was rich in its possession of the land. But suppose the members of a particular family did not labor on the land. Because they did not work on the land, they became very poor. Little by little they sold the land until their entire allotment was sold. In this way they lost their portion of the good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="FyPO0Bs_RXrorVGapaNdArrFgpUWneMjMpEk0aYSfanBP0SA21ajMTzZdZb6Sdt3F"> When land was sold in a country other than Israel, the land was sold forever. But God’s ordination did not allow the land in Israel to be sold permanently. At most, the land could be sold only for fifty years. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71196" data-verses="Leviticus 25:23-24">Leviticus 25:23 and 24</span> say, “The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for <span class="pg" data-page-id="549" id="549">[549]</span> ye are strangers and sojourners with me. And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.” Here we see that the land was not sold forever; land that had been sold could be redeemed. The one who bought the land did not have the right to keep it indefinitely. After fifty years at the latest, the land could be redeemed. </p>
<p data-content-id="Cx-Kq8f_kufcXTjbI_whK8V8OaHzT6d8wbuRcXv4ortX3gIXqwulpXeobzCQdoJJ1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71197" data-verses="Leviticus 25:1">Leviticus 25</span> we are told not that the land was returned to its original owner, but that the person returned to the land. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71198" data-verses="Leviticus 25:28">verse 28</span> says, “In the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.” Actually, one did not sell the land—he sold himself. Eventually, it was not the land that was returned to the seller; it was the seller that returned to the land, to his possession. </p>

We saw that the word “jubilee” is an anglicized form of the Hebrew word <em>yobel.</em> This Hebrew word signifies the blast of a horn, specifically the signal of a silver trumpet; hence, it came to signify the instrument itself and the festival thus introduced. In this message we shall consider further the definition of the jubilee. </p>

The blast of the trumpet proclaimed the jubilee. But in what year and on what day of the year was the trumpet of the jubilee sounded? Some may answer this question by saying, “Since the jubilee was the fiftieth year, the trumpet of the jubilee must have been sounded on the first day of the fiftieth year.” This answer may be reasonable, but it is according to the natural concept. We should not bring our natural thought into our reading of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="SlZ9LfzTj9oNzJ6-raS1Aqm-FtUqhJ-Hu1E2vmyVDkctfWDUrJm1vTh_wbOlz4rGj"> If we read the book of Leviticus carefully, we shall see that every seventh year was to be a sabbatical year. In a sabbatical year there was to be no sowing, reaping, or harvesting. The people were not allowed to work, and neither was the land allowed to work. Both the people and the land were to enjoy rest. This rest, this sabbath, was to be every seven years. Concerning the sabbaths <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71213" data-verses="Leviticus 25:8">Leviticus 25:8</span> says, “And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, <span class="pg" data-page-id="554" id="554">[554]</span> seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71214" data-verses="Leviticus 25:9">Leviticus 25:9</span> says, “Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.” Notice that this verse begins with the word “then.” It is difficult to explain the time indicated by this “then.” When was “then”? Was it in the forty-ninth year or in the fiftieth year? </p>
<p data-content-id="y695EWmpNHnEWPC-oqj1C12J3jSUoQBFyaZAx96FqVB_sFX0OYnWKsHhj6JUg1n-e"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71215" data-verses="Leviticus 25:9">Leviticus 25:9</span>, the jubilee was sounded on the day of atonement, which was on the tenth day of the seventh month. It was necessary for the trumpet of the jubilee to be sounded on the day of atonement because the jubilee is based on redemption. Without redemption there cannot be the jubilee. Therefore, the proclamation of the jubilee must be from the time of redemption. In typology, the day, or time, of redemption was signified by the day of atonement on the tenth day of the seventh month. The seventh month was the first month of the second half of the year. Concerning the sounding of the trumpet of jubilee, we need to ask if this was the seventh month of the forty-ninth year or of the fiftieth year. </p>
<p data-content-id="8rK9hZU17CqFQv_7c_sMeUDV076l38frJWrb3fYskUnsCbvB8WxSNVgXi8Bko75qT"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71216" data-verses="Leviticus 25:10">Leviticus 25:10</span> tells us, “And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.” To hallow the fiftieth year is to sanctify that year, and to proclaim liberty throughout the land is to proclaim release. Here we see that this liberty, this release, involves the returning of every man to his possession and of every man to his family. This verse does not speak of the return of a man’s possession, but of the return of a man to his possession. </p>
<p data-content-id="0yMFLpTNFijhdJXKfBtsRVr0HDyobmW8BsYvNv_3Cioz9unzd69fVMg-p6C0n6Ifp"> Now that we have read these important verses, let us study the relationship between the sounding of the trumpet of the jubilee on the tenth day of the seventh month and the sanctifying of the fiftieth year as the year of jubilee. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71217" data-verses="Leviticus 25:9">Leviticus 25:9</span> indicates that the forty-ninth year is divided into two sections of six months each. In the middle of the forty-ninth year the <span class="pg" data-page-id="555" id="555">[555]</span> trumpet of the jubilee was sounded on the day of atonement. The fiftieth year began six months later. If the trumpet of the jubilee was sounded in the fiftieth year and not in the forty-ninth year, then the jubilee would have begun six months after the start of the fiftieth year. That, however, was not the situation. Contrary to our natural concept, the trumpet of the jubilee was not sounded on the first day of the first month of the fiftieth year. Rather, it was sounded on the tenth day of the seventh month of the forty-ninth year. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71218" data-verses="Leviticus 25:8">Verse 8</span> speaks of the forty-nine years; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71219" data-verses="Leviticus 25:9">verse 9</span>, of the sounding of the trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71220" data-verses="Leviticus 25:10">verse 10</span>, of the hallowing of the fiftieth year. From this we see that the sounding was in the forty-ninth year, and the sanctifying, the hallowing, was not from the seventh month of the forty-ninth year, but from the beginning of the fiftieth year. This means that the sounding of the trumpet was a preparation, a preliminary step, for the jubilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="7WKyJ1T_uHk5hAsLJQ81oK8FJj4I670thJCRuFLar2G9usySzvd5B-MQRqEDy9EDO"> We have pointed out that the day of atonement typifies the time of redemption. The fact that the trumpet of the jubilee was sounded on the day of atonement and that the fiftieth year was sanctified and liberty was proclaimed throughout the land indicates that it was necessary first for Christ to die and then for there to be the proclamation of the release of the people. In other words, first Christ died, and then there was the genuine preaching of the gospel. The gospel could not be preached unless Christ had already died. Therefore, the proclamation, the preaching, of the gospel is based on the death of Christ. The sounding out of the gospel depends on Christ’s redemption. Without the redemption of Christ, there would be no basis for the proclamation of the jubilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="_ZwqsA5v5sK5Gd_CGtUVx_U-oyUvJZvrd4_dLBztnh2YyrGo-ZQKJ0rrkSkFZAXKk"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71221" data-verses="Leviticus 25:1">Leviticus 25</span>, the sounding of the trumpet of the jubilee took place six months before the actual beginning of the year of jubilee. The jubilee began from the first month of the fiftieth year, but the sounding of the trumpet of the jubilee was in the middle of the forty-ninth year, six months earlier. When applied to our spiritual experience, this <span class="pg" data-page-id="556" id="556">[556]</span> indicates that the preaching of the gospel comes first and the jubilee follows. Many of us can testify that in our experience of salvation we heard the preaching of the gospel long before we were saved. The preaching of the gospel came to us a considerable time before we entered into the jubilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="B-xax8NKp7LCijI7RvQMm9Jos3kSlmvYlicWUqjousBPGePPVlOH7nulgHhpJQvmR"> If we read carefully <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71222" data-verses="Leviticus 25:8-10">Leviticus 25:8-10</span>, we shall see that the sounding of the trumpet always took place before the year of jubilee. This means that the sounding of the jubilee took place in the seventh month of the forty-ninth year as a preparation for the jubilee, which began at the start of the next year. Beginning with the first month of the year, the fiftieth year was hallowed, sanctified, as the year of jubilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="xdxTxFZ3QLG06tmoSbQONLKoarNeZMRzYj39H4NLabyTJr4rWTMePzQvvgQ8LEOaY"> I can testify that in my case the sounding of the gospel came to me at least eight years before I entered into the jubilee. When I was a child, I heard the preaching of the gospel. But I did not experience the jubilee until I was nineteen. </p>
<p data-content-id="rR_dpE6vYaDaPaCKk01uoiNGNcFtz_3rupQBp4xmcb2zrtZinaTEqSTzFHUuwqBbj"> Many of us passed through a period of preparation for salvation before we actually received salvation. Did you go through such a period of preparation before you entered into the enjoyment of salvation, that is, before you entered into the jubilee? Some cases, however, are extraordinary. These are cases of saints who entered into the jubilee at the time they first heard the gospel and learned of the Lord Jesus. But there are not many cases like this. Most Christians had a time of preparation first and experienced the jubilee sometime after they first heard the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="dvWnnIN7e0JKw-7c_KXxsoFKvbCR3lHyth-Z-qR8i3gE62O3MzE72ycw46N8mvBgO"> Most of us first heard the gospel sounding of the jubilee. Then some time later we received God’s salvation at a time that was hallowed, sanctified, and we entered into the jubilee. When we entered into the jubilee, we returned to our possession and to our family; we returned to God as our possession and to the family, the house, of God. </p>

For our understanding, it is good to have the definition of the jubilee. The blessings of the jubilee, however, are not for our understanding; the blessings are for our enjoyment. In addition to understanding the jubilee, we need to enjoy it. We surely need the blessings of the jubilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mixvss-j9tzRFTxyteZ8AIhNaqOl6bARPohV1ILcl2Rfd6ZbvrtmR-ZjJ-Sa8BhLR"> Actually, the preaching of the gospel is the sounding, the trumpeting, of the jubilee. In the preaching of the gospel, we proclaim glad tidings, good news. This good news is that we can be returned to our lost possession and that we can be freed from slavery, from bondage. In our gospel preaching, we need to trumpet the jubilee; we need to proclaim the return to the lost possession and the release from bondage. </p>
<p data-content-id="VnpGtuJZc2t4WkT0SavTgZws9FrNE0CWBPCyIGrj5PYt8QUzResVcYufIW_qbioEP"> According to the type in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71252" data-verses="Leviticus 25:1">Leviticus 25</span>, the jubilee has two main blessings.

To be more exact, actually we did not lose our possession—we left it. The parable of the prodigal son <span class="pg" data-page-id="562" id="562">[562]</span> illustrates this. When the prodigal son left the father’s house, he also left his inheritance. Likewise, when we left God, we left our true possession. Therefore, in the jubilee it is not that our possession is returned to us; rather, we are returned to the possession which we left. The first blessing of the jubilee is the return to our possession. </p>
<p data-content-id="6v5bqSZVkxM1HMGlWOBeNpm8O5Ww8o25b4qVQMP5MlzkvkTR8-sJeZYdiAzVYImAy"> In addition to losing our possession, we also lost ourselves by selling ourselves into slavery. Therefore, we need to be set free. This is the second blessing of the jubilee. If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71253" data-verses="Leviticus 25:1">Leviticus 25</span> carefully, you will see that, on the one hand, there is the return to one’s possession, and, on the other hand, the return to one’s family. </p>
<p data-content-id="RZzGEogxd1MGIsl2eY5kp2iHSdLcm5J3IdyqcTX_a5S28-G-Yz8OH2qUTV12ioiQD"> We all once were prodigals who went away from the Father and from His household. As those who went away both from the Father and from His house, we certainly went away from our inheritance. Therefore, it was necessary for us to be returned to the Father and to His household. This is the jubilee as illustrated by the parable of the prodigal son in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71254" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="sd53dK7V3RACxeAhbYJarIvJWY7CXd4lKCZrOk5KHHUk8v9DyXsEuqfotQsdDEpDq"> The New Testament jubilee was proclaimed by the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71255" data-verses="Luke 4:18-19">Luke 4:18 and 19</span>. He sounded out the trumpet of the New Testament jubilee when He declared, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to send away in release those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.” After this jubilee was proclaimed, it was experienced by many whose cases are recorded in the Gospel of Luke. All these cases, therefore, are illustrations of the New Testament jubilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="whXJpCNVhaMbONnpOo1lLEbV78Gr88OYrW5ZYazISocRSVFEj93Rh6WuKCXo2tcws"> Among the many illustrations of the jubilee in the Gospel of Luke, the best is the case of the prodigal son being returned to his father, to his father’s household, and to his inheritance. After the prodigal had spent all, a severe famine occurred, and he began to be in want (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71256" data-verses="Luke 15:14">Luke 15:14</span>). He then “went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed hogs. And he was longing to be satisfied with the carob pods which the <span class="pg" data-page-id="563" id="563">[563]</span> hogs were eating, and no one gave him anything” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71257" data-verses="Luke 15:15-16">vv. 15-16</span>). When he came to himself, he said, “How many of my father’s hired servants have an abundance of bread, but I am perishing here with famine! I will rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71258" data-verses="Luke 15:17-19">vv. 17-19</span>). Here we see that the prodigal wanted to be as those who sowed, reaped, and harvested (things which were forbidden in the year of jubilee) by exerting his own effort. His intention was to tell his father that since he was no longer worthy of being a son, he would like to labor as a hired one. But according to the type in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71259" data-verses="Leviticus 25:1">Leviticus 25</span>, during the year of jubilee there was to be no sowing, reaping, or harvesting. During that year there was not to be any labor on the land. Hence, the prodigal son should not have come back to the father to be a laborer. He should be returned to the father as one being returned to enjoy his possession. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lj54LQasZ-K8EIg0J8QBinZk1nfFprp5qpL9M39N7uxjTamFkVxVWNhxhdjVx7yWi"> When the prodigal son was returned, he began to say, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71260" data-verses="Luke 15:21">v. 21</span>). The father, not having an ear to hear such nonsensical talk, interrupted him and said to his slaves, “Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet; and bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71261" data-verses="Luke 15:22-23">vv. 22-23</span>). Do you know what the fattened calf signifies? The fattened calf signifies the rich Christ as our inheritance. In the words of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71262" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">Colossians 1:12</span>, this is Christ as the portion of the saints. After the prodigal son was returned, he, the father, and those in the household began to enjoy the inheritance. Here in the case of the prodigal son we have a clear picture of the New Testament jubilee. A genuine conversion should be like that of the prodigal son portrayed in this parable. </p>

Eating is a spiritual necessity, and Christ is the supply to meet this need. <span class="pg" data-page-id="565" id="565">[565]</span> </p>

God intended to be man’s possession (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71307" data-verses="Psalms 16:5">Psa. 16:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71308" data-verses="Psalms 90:1">90:1</span>), but man lost God because of man’s fall (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71309" data-verses="Ephesians 2:12">Eph. 2:12</span>). However, God’s jubilee brings man back to God as his inheritance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71310" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71311" data-verses="Ephesians 1:14">Eph. 1:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71312" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">Col. 1:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71313" data-verses="Luke 15:12-23">Luke 15:12-23</span>). Let us now go on to see the second main blessing of the jubilee. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sd53dK7V3RACxeAhbYZata_JWY7CXd4lKCZrOk5KHHUk8v9DyXsEuqfotQsdDEpDq">FREED FROM SLAVERY</h2><p data-content-id="whXJpCNVhaMbONnpOollCX7V78Gr88OYrW5ZYazISocRSVFEj93Rh6WuKCXo2tcws"> The second blessing of the jubilee is that those who have sold themselves as slaves are freed from their slavery (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71314" data-verses="Leviticus 25:39-41">Lev. 25:39-41</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71315" data-verses="Leviticus 25:54">54</span>). According to the type in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71316" data-verses="Leviticus 25:1">Leviticus 25</span>, an Israelite may become so poor that he must sell his possession. Then he may go deeper into poverty and even sell himself. Having lost himself, he becomes a slave. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lj54LQasZ-K8EIg0J8ABq0pk1nfFprp5qpL9M39N7uxjTamFkVxVWNhxhdjVx7yWi"> The one who had sold himself into slavery could try to redeem himself. However, if he could not redeem himself before the year of jubilee, he was to be released in that year. “If he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, both he, and his children with him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71317" data-verses="Leviticus 25:54">Lev. 25:54</span>). This means that in the fiftieth year, in the year of jubilee, the one who had sold himself as a slave was freed from his slavery. <span class="pg" data-page-id="572" id="572">[572]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="dvWnnIN7e0JKw-7c_K3xsqFKvbCR3lHyth-Z-qR8i3gE62O3MzE72ycw46N8mvBgO"> The picture in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71318" data-verses="Leviticus 25:1">Leviticus 25</span> is very meaningful. This picture indicates that from the time of the fall man has sold himself as a slave, in particular as a slave of sin. Although man tried to redeem himself, he was not able to do so. In the dispensations of conscience, human government, promise, and law, man was not able to redeem himself. But then the dispensation of grace came, a dispensation typified by the fiftieth year. In this dispensation fallen man can be released from bondage. </p>
<p data-content-id="QS_uuvFcVjx6uGVtJuOBZCQnlYKY1jnXQkbZwmBnmy1XcRsI7z2kVs1C7kIjs7vSf"> The New Testament reveals that fallen man has been sold to sin as its slave. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71319" data-verses="Romans 7:14">Romans 7:14</span> Paul declares, “I am fleshly, sold under sin.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71320" data-verses="John 8:34">John 8:34</span> the Lord Jesus says, “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.” God’s jubilee frees fallen man from sin. For this reason, the Lord says, “If then the Son shall set you free, you shall be really free.” Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71321" data-verses="Romans 6:6-7">Romans 6:6 and 7</span> Paul tells us, “Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him that the body of sin might be made of none effect, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves; for he who has died is justified from sin.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71322" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Romans 8:2</span> Paul goes on to say, “The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.” Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71323" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">Galatians 5:1</span>, God’s jubilee also frees us from the bondage of law. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="K6HmpZJGTPRsiY1an1uYBDZ34UlqtsBFDVHQgSo9S8is_l13ggA-7Yse3XgT2zYV3">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE YEAR OF JUBILEE<br/>BEING THE FIFTIETH YEAR</h2><p data-content-id="lXx03sAZnH1566ErO9Ak_LGN6YjVqHNC8OyUynANn47kviFgaPXvRFBN-BRclOuC0"> Let us consider once again the significance of the year of jubilee being the fiftieth year. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71324" data-verses="Leviticus 25:8">Leviticus 25:8</span> says, “And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71325" data-verses="Leviticus 25:10">verse 10</span>, the people were to “hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.” We may say that the seven sabbaths of years in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71326" data-verses="Leviticus 25:8">verse 8</span>, the seven times seven years, are <span class="pg" data-page-id="573" id="573">[573]</span> also seven “weeks” of years (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71327" data-verses="Daniel 9:24-26">Dan. 9:24-26</span>). In the Bible a week, a period of seven days, signifies a complete course. For example, in a course of seven days God created the universe and everything in it and then rested. Therefore, the seven days of a week indicate a complete course. </p>
<p data-content-id="O6A_Zpet8NpkAD12wynVI8X96Jkgmribh2Ghh9n9QaeX9vJyetjJM0RwCL0BYvdJK"> In the sense that a week signifies a complete course, our Christian life may also be regarded as a week. The week of our Christian life is signified by the feast of unleavened bread. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71328" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span> we see that the feast of unleavened bread lasted seven days. In the Life-study of Exodus we pointed out that the seven days of the feast of unleavened bread signify the entire course of our Christian life from the time we are saved until the time our body is redeemed. </p>
<p data-content-id="454lFLK2tydPg5el5GWBbcHpHQtD5QB0eD81SP4uSuDpX_AQORq44Je3A02kXbzxC"> The jubilee did not come at the end of a single week of years, but after a course of seven weeks of seven years. The year after seven weeks of seven years was, of course, the fiftieth year, the first year of the eighth week of seven years. </p>
<p data-content-id="ov0pwXq8uOJOycOiD16N-d2IpYzHGrTUx1Dbcc3jku5CrgeFN6HqgZR5btlLER604"> In the Bible the number eight signifies resurrection. The Lord Jesus was resurrected on the eighth day, on the first day of the week. In keeping with this principle, the first year of each new week, or period, of seven years was an eighth year, and this eighth year may be considered a year of resurrection. The year of jubilee was the seventh “eighth year.” This means that this eighth year, which is the fiftieth year, indicates seven times resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="37AX-gTuAtUIfnNeIXah6mFkDbtYWR3LTu6iLVxczyu6wYZF7FopoaS4d9S_W-BJ4"> The principle of the jubilee being on the fiftieth year is the same as that of the day of Pentecost being on the fiftieth day. The day of Pentecost was on the seventh eighth day, just as the year of jubilee was on the seventh eighth year. After seven courses of days came the day of Pentecost, and after seven courses of years came the year of jubilee. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Gn7ewN6nSdByHJgqhSHgXXUOe-1UTJncAcUqo6emH0AAxLxRlyu8isObL6a-GDD-q">APPRECIATING THE JUBILEE</h2><p data-content-id="crbZLnwlQe1t-R2NKH0jvIAIu5vZMDiBZWVp3fX5a8i7iFrksEzKqpk9CFqNeA0KZ"> Let us now apply this to our experience of salvation. Just as the year of jubilee came after seven complete courses of years, so many of us experienced salvation only after we had passed through several “courses” in our human life. On the <span class="pg" data-page-id="574" id="574">[574]</span> one hand, it is very good to be saved early in life, in our youth. But on the other hand, there is also a good point to being saved after passing through a number of lengthy courses in human life. For example, suppose a man is saved in his fifties. He has passed through a number of courses: youth, college, marriage, and advancement in his profession. Having passed through all these courses, he experiences a real jubilee when he is saved. For years, as indicated by the seven weeks of years before the year of jubilee, he may have tried to redeem himself, but without success. Then one day he hears the trumpeting of the jubilee through the preaching of the gospel, and he is saved. He had come to hate, to despise, all the courses in his life. Now he enjoys the release of the jubilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y58zRdwVwZdOug4Omt3YUyui5YTN0tMwYIpE2xtAxeB5rWIwx_UI_h1Cxbmt9gLsn"> A person who is saved early in life, perhaps at the age of twelve, may not have much realization of the significance of the jubilee. To him, it may make little difference whether or not there is a jubilee, because he has not passed through many courses in life. But one who has passed through many courses will surely appreciate the jubilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="EnWCv_eiedBm6acXcTAA3hI36_MxGVx9OO_VMk3ydCyoMCmwj4AjjstBnWwxvP728"> In one sense, the earlier a person is saved, the better. We certainly should not delay the preaching of the gospel to others. My point here is that when a person is saved later in life, he has a greater enjoyment of the jubilee than one who is saved as a child. Suppose a boy is saved at the age of six. Since he has not passed through even one or two courses in human life, he cannot have much appreciation of the jubilee. But one who has gone through many courses will have much appreciation of what it is to be saved. </p>
<p data-content-id="DoAIPBJjBHkq_0FWd4zCjdOpXz6H4o4mOlsgbBKk_d-ko1FGk9fqp5bptFLQcr1Cs"> Do not misunderstand me and think that I would encourage someone to wait to be saved. Those who are saved at an early age have the opportunity to learn more of the Bible and to experience and enjoy more of the Lord. From this point of view, it is better for a person to be saved at an early age. Nevertheless, those who are saved later in life have the opportunity to have a greater enjoyment of the jubilee. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="pQRuKAJlDonWZe7uVbhGzPyH2ZE-H030jYTeXH3ooRncRbKpIKHOqeYDJyj9C--Un">THE RESULT OF MAN’S FALL</h2><p data-content-id="vOVAPClIw9o-SMbO7PVlNlSn2shm1hmqQ-J4zvC1dCk_Dq1MQU0ZikmVpJu7Jramo"> Before we consider these two aspects of living in the jubilee, I would like to give a further word concerning man’s fall. The Bible reveals clearly that man has become fallen. According to God’s purpose, man was made to contain God and express Him. In order for man to fulfill this purpose, it was necessary for man to take God in as his life and then continue to enjoy God as his life supply. Only by taking God as life and enjoying God as his life supply can man live a life to express God. As we have often pointed out in other messages, this is the clear revelation in the Bible as a whole. </p>
<p data-content-id="WVNqXX68ZMdi0Is0O0CrJJmMw6vNnBJsEhQPV8kOVHacHdtLj25qcwOhqs0Rn3f7G"> Instead of fulfilling God’s purpose, the man created by God was seduced by God’s enemy and carried away from God’s purpose. Man sinned against God and became fallen. </p>
<p data-content-id="AUNZZyVVAVOomKPrsSGiXVO12JhGBpIJR1Zd6ilPf-0XAUbPCWwsUR_yeQ_zGl6pN"> Unbelievers, of course, do not have a clear understanding of man’s fall and its result. Even many Christians who are <span class="pg" data-page-id="580" id="580">[580]</span> clear about man’s fall do not have an adequate understanding of the issue, or the result, of the fall. Therefore, we need to be impressed with the fact that the issue of man’s fall involves two things: first, man’s losing of God; second, man’s falling into bondage, slavery, captivity. Throughout the history of mankind, man has been without God and has been in bondage. For thousands of years man has been in slavery, having lost God as his possession. This is true of every people, race, country, and nation. </p>

I once had this kind of dream, but I woke up from it and realized that human life is filled with all kinds of suffering. Those who are married have problems, but those who are not married may have just as many problems, if not more. As far as problems and sufferings are concerned, it is difficult to say whether it is better to be married or unmarried. Because believers are eager to learn how to have a happy married life, books on marriage are popular in Christian book stores. Surely any married person, knowing the problems of married life, would like to know how to have a happy marriage. The young people, however, do not know how many problems there can be in married life. I mention this to give one example of the sufferings in human life. </p>
<p data-content-id="PIjOD0qFuTXceUSZoAWZDZcE0eeqSfaj3wRhOBw1FeXJDCmFaOPLe_ykOCcLaqUht"> Another example is the problem caused by riches. Those who desire to be rich may not realize that riches can cause trouble. I know of a certain brother who has become quite rich in the past twenty years, but his riches have caused him great suffering. Because of the trouble and sufferings brought about by wealth, many rich people do not have a long life. They are exhausted and weakened by their riches. </p>
<p data-content-id="-L1fy_zrwSJXUU5n6tnTQQRsvBf8gL-7zbw6oEqqqLY7uMvSfrnIP_SgjrRC490ZA"> Recently I read an article in the newspaper about a Chinese man who was once the president of a college in China. This man is now one hundred years of age. When he reached the age of one hundred, many of his former students held a <span class="pg" data-page-id="581" id="581">[581]</span> feast in honor of his birthday. During the feast he said that he thanked God that he was not a rich man, because if he had been wealthy, he would never have lived to reach the age of one hundred. According to his understanding, the lack of riches was an important factor in his living to the age of one hundred. </p>
<p data-content-id="pQRuKAJlDonWZe7uVbhG1cCH2ZE-H030jYTeXH3ooRncRbKpIKHOqeYDJyj9C--Un"> The point we are making is that human life is a life of suffering. Both riches and poverty are causes of suffering. Those who are poor may have anxiety, but those who are rich may have even more anxiety. </p>
<p data-content-id="vOVAPClIw9o-SMbO7PVlE2Sn2shm1hmqQ-J4zvC1dCk_Dq1MQU0ZikmVpJu7Jramo"> Another kind of human suffering is that experienced by those who are the leaders of countries. The president or head of a country must bear a very heavy burden, a burden much greater than that borne by an ordinary person. Anyone who is not in good health should not seek a high political office because the pressure on him will be great. This is another illustration of the fact that human life is a life of suffering. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="WVNqXX68ZMdi0Is0O0CrBa2Mw6vNnBJsEhQPV8kOVHacHdtLj25qcwOhqs0Rn3f7G">Seeking Rest and Enjoyment</h2><p data-content-id="2tNCATtNEU-uXYvQtPQ4mnXqLxK2yI2K223oVb_0w5iwpZu36YT9EiPenSev2WCos"> Do you know what it means to suffer? Do you know the significance of suffering? The real significance of suffering is twofold: to suffer is to have no rest, and to suffer is to have no enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="uZQjh9ACdCObo73nGgKmaJwDnu18yBYq6-Sf_S2e8ePelXrhqcHNu9IrQr-mDbhX0"> God created man with the appetite, the aspiration, for rest and enjoyment. God created man with such an aspiration because God’s intention was that man would continually seek after Him. Therefore, every human being is seeking rest and enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="f5f0VDzn9jkRQSn1Jwlf_axwlK3eq6Siv45D3Z1PVOSaG41wTyIuG2c1MeKQAjvFj"> Rest requires satisfaction. If a person does not have satisfaction, he cannot have rest. From experience we know that we can rest only when we are satisfied. Furthermore, satisfaction comes from enjoyment. Hence, if we do not have enjoyment, we do not have satisfaction; and if we do not have satisfaction, we do not have rest. Everyone is hungering and thirsting for rest and enjoyment. To be without rest and enjoyment is to suffer. </p>
<p data-content-id="IpVW-KDk2ZPgTnA3cBDrS5l6ISFzZIDAsieA6ADySAHJiaJ_KT5O4yrRjpf5t_Bzi"> The reason a brother desires to get married is that he is <span class="pg" data-page-id="582" id="582">[582]</span> seeking rest and enjoyment. He thinks that he cannot find rest in anyone other than a wife. He regards marriage as something that will provide rest and enjoyment. Likewise, a sister desires a husband because she thinks that married life will be a “couch” on which she may rest. </p>
<p data-content-id="HjWwmoGOlsak0TUDVBi_vcFVb6Y9pPEtBKlHqojq6TpIxbKDnyfW41Pa33wfqt__Y"> Why do we need marriage? We need marriage because we want rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment. However, how much real rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment do you experience in your married life? Many can testify that in married life the suffering may be greater than the rest and satisfaction and that the troubles may be greater than the enjoyment. Suffering in married life may be caused even by the issue of whether the bedroom window should be open or closed. A husband and wife may argue over a matter such as this. Although people get married because they need rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment, the real rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment are not found in married life. </p>
<p data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IOITFFxdLPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW"> We have seen that the rich, as well as the poor, have their sufferings in life. For example, someone with a large savings account may worry about inflation. Even though he has thousands of dollars in the bank, he may still be anxious about money. </p>
<p data-content-id="kAQNthUaZvalgvsKBtTCeAsJbCrdyQWj0UWwMbQUlst1TdatH57vU3-PT1x1LNEeo"> In every area of human life the “debit” side may be greater than the “credit” side. This means that whatever choice we make regarding a particular matter, the result may be more debit than credit. Whether we are married or unmarried, rich or poor, the debit may be larger than the credit. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jgkr79uXp4nHSqPJ0FYf1Ncwm7qGnaecC8bfNtJTx_m3Ubj0zJ3n8sOq8U2GgJfUN"> The destiny of every unsaved person whether married or unmarried, rich or poor, is hell. This is why people need God’s salvation; this is why they need the gospel. Without God’s salvation, a person is going downward to hell, no matter what his situation may be. Those who are educated and cultured and those who are uneducated and uncultured are all going downward to hell. Because they are on this downward way, they cannot have any rest. How they need to hear the preaching of the gospel, the sounding out of the jubilee! <span class="pg" data-page-id="583" id="583">[583]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="zYdoNmJ8sJ3EfPJeEl3NgpbY9_7RUWZfgnhUmVfdTB_5mEQTlpUx_z2KThQMh-S0-"> Fallen mankind has lost God and is in bondage. Consider the situation of the children of Israel in Egypt. All the Israelites were under bondage. It may seem that Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, was superior, but he also was in bondage. Both the Israelites and the Egyptians had lost God and were in bondage. Likewise, today fallen mankind is in bondage. The rich and the poor, the educated and the uneducated, the married and the unmarried—all are in bondage. Only when we have God are we no longer in bondage, for God is our release, our liberty, even our liberation. </p>

<p data-content-id="kAQNthUaZvalgvsKBtDCaTMJbCrdyQWj0UWwMbQUlst1TdatH57vU3-PT1x1LNEeo"> Let us continue to consider the living of the jubilee, that is, the kind of life that lives in the jubilee. We pointed out in the foregoing message that this is a life of resting in the good land and of enjoying the riches of the good land. Our Christian life should be a life full of liberty, freedom, and release, a life full of rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Jgkr79uXp4nHSqPJ0FIfweswm7qGnaecC8bfNtJTx_m3Ubj0zJ3n8sOq8U2GgJfUN">A LIFE OF ENJOYMENT</h2><p data-content-id="zYdoNmJ8sJ3EfPJeElnNq6bY9_7RUWZfgnhUmVfdTB_5mEQTlpUx_z2KThQMh-S0-"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71369" data-verses="Luke 15:23">Luke 15:23</span> indicates that the Christian life should be a life of enjoyment: “And bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry.” The result of the prodigal son’s coming back to his father’s house was that he and all those in the house could eat, drink, and be merry. This indicates that we should eat Christ as the fattened calf, drink the life-giving Spirit, and be merry in the enjoyment of the Triune God and in the riches of the Father’s house. </p>
<p data-content-id="aJBHB16Du0i39s63o_74x1PcHmEpg--JpExe5woWN23707a7BR6E28G078JPrLzJy"> As we go on to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71370" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:8">1 Corinthians 5:8</span> we see that the Christian life is a feast: “Let us therefore keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and evil, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.” The feast here refers to the feast of unleavened bread as the continuation of the Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71371" data-verses="Exodus 12:15-20">Exo. 12:15-20</span>). This feast lasted for seven days, the period of a complete course, signifying the entire period of our Christian life, from the day of our conversion to the day of rapture. This is a long feast which we should <span class="pg" data-page-id="588" id="588">[588]</span> keep with unleavened bread, which is Christ as our nourishment and enjoyment. Only He is the life supply of sincerity and truth, absolutely pure, without mixture, and full of reality. Such a feast is a time for enjoyment. The entire Christian life should be a feast and an enjoyment of Christ as the rich supply of life. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71372" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:8">1 Corinthians 5:8</span> Paul charges us to keep the feast with Christ as unleavened bread. </p>
<p data-content-id="Gn7ewN6nSdByHJgqhRngXVUOe-1UTJncAcUqo6emH0AAxLxRlyu8isObL6a-GDD-q"> A feast is not a time for working; rather, it is a time for eating, enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest. In the Christian life Christ should be our food, enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest. </p>
<p data-content-id="crbZLnwlQe1t-R2NKEUjvKAIu5vZMDiBZWVp3fX5a8i7iFrksEzKqpk9CFqNeA0KZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71373" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span> Paul says, “To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the nations the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.” Paul preached not the doctrines but the riches of Christ. The riches of Christ are what He is to us, such as light, life, righteousness, and holiness, for our experience and enjoyment. These riches are unsearchable and untraceable. The Christian life is a life of enjoying the unsearchable riches of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y58zRdwVwZdOug4OmuXYXyOi5YTN0tMwYIpE2xtAxeB5rWIwx_UI_h1Cxbmt9gLsn"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71374" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">Philippians 1:19</span> Paul speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Christian life is a life of enjoying this bountiful supply. </p>
<p data-content-id="EnWCv_eiedBm6acXcQgA0ho36_MxGVx9OO_VMk3ydCyoMCmwj4AjjstBnWwxvP728"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71375" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:9">2 Corinthians 12:9</span> we see that Paul experienced and enjoyed the grace of Christ: “And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71376" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Corinthians 13:14</span> Paul goes on to say, “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.” To be sure, the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit are for our enjoyment. The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as life to us for our enjoyment, the love of God is God Himself as the source of the grace of the Lord, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our participation. The result of the enjoyment of the grace of the Lord, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit is satisfaction, and the issue of this enjoyment and satisfaction <span class="pg" data-page-id="589" id="589">[589]</span> is rest. All Christians should have this enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest. </p>
<p data-content-id="DoAIPBJjBHkq_0FWd7TCgcupXz6H4o4mOlsgbBKk_d-ko1FGk9fqp5bptFLQcr1Cs"> However, only a small minority of Christians daily are enjoying the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit. Where are we with respect to this enjoyment? Many of us are laboring and are full of anxiety and worry. Furthermore, we have many expectations or dreams. Eventually, because these dreams are not fulfilled, we are disappointed and have suffering. Many among us daily are laboring, worrying, dreaming, and suffering. Someone may dream of becoming rich, but this dream leads to disappointment and suffering. Human life is a life of laboring, worrying, dreaming, and suffering. </p>
<p data-content-id="SlZ9LfzTj9oNzJ6-rZS1I5W-FtUqhJ-Hu1E2vmyVDkctfWDUrJm1vTh_wbOlz4rGj"> Some believers who are still laboring, worrying, dreaming, and suffering may say, “I thought that life would be better after I became a Christian, but it’s about the same. What, then, is the purpose of being a Christian?” Because of questions such as this, a number of Christians have been attracted to the teaching concerning prosperity, the teaching which claims that Christians can become rich and successful. Nevertheless, it is a fact that most Christians are laboring, worrying, dreaming, and suffering. Furthermore, most, whether they are a success or a failure, are going in a downward direction. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gIbolEPmx05b9aaM5L9Xe8D6mLMAfdyt6RkK1EfHgPUcUpUKFw_EQp0WLDUU4a_bg">THE THREE KINDS OF LABOR IN HUMAN LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="eZHFLAbNWwOTr1-IstCDpgNBlkr6ZBJMGzugC7yI_anSHrEw64TAXVbz6cBzraKtb"> If we read the Bible carefully, we shall see that there are three kinds of labor in human life, not including working at a job to earn a living. The first kind of labor is the labor to be a good person, to have good behavior, and to improve one’s character. In this labor people struggle to be humble, patient, and loving. In the Bible, especially in the New Testament, to work means to do such things. But no one can be saved by works (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71377" data-verses="Ephesians 2:8-9">Eph. 2:8-9</span>). This means that no one can be saved by the works of trying to improve one’s behavior and character, to keep the law, and to be good, patient, kind, and honest. This kind of effort is a real labor, and in the New Testament this is called work. <span class="pg" data-page-id="590" id="590">[590]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="5xKEgdpuEwfEMeypJXpXxQKMqK2Fa2tvJZgq5hBR6INjxpLJ7ifzk23cJPGz7OALQ"> According to the Bible, the second kind of labor is to worry, to be anxious. What a hard job it is to labor under anxiety! If you could do your job day by day without having any anxiety, you would be a healthy person. However, you may spend more hours each day worrying than you do working. Can you say that you have not had any anxiety, any worry, so far today? Day by day, everyone is anxious. You may be anxious about your health, your job, or a great many other things. I, of course, am not an exception. I have learned from experience that the only way to escape anxiety is to enjoy the Lord. Whenever I am not enjoying Christ, I have anxiety. Christ is versus anxiety. In the Life-study of Philippians we gave a number of messages entitled “A Life Full of Forbearance but without Anxiety.” </p>
<p data-content-id="NIP9vcQSpsaW9kg20LHrauOUIxlFrb3RZvwz6cWaDdxDBDLgKxxI62zDhQMwvPdhT"> The third kind of labor revealed in the Bible is suffering. Suffering is a very hard labor. When we enjoy God in the jubilee, there should not be any suffering. Paul, for example, suffered from a “thorn in the flesh” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71378" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:7">2 Cor. 12:7</span>). Concerning this thorn, he entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71379" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:8">v. 8</span>). However, instead of removing the thorn, the Lord said to him, “My grace is sufficient for you.” The Lord seemed to be telling Paul, “No, I shall not remove the thorn, for My grace is sufficient. If you enjoy Me, you will not have any suffering.” </p>
<p data-content-id="tm_3_WpwudCvX6CkWq4A7s3M1GTBpy9OgG7uBMDbsNsUIce-CSAdVjV8DKlJDOLGv"> To say that we shall not have suffering when we enjoy the Lord does not mean that our environment will improve. On the contrary, in many cases the environment changes for the worse. Consider the situation of Paul and Silas in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71380" data-verses="Acts 16:1">Acts 16</span>. Paul and Silas were cast into prison in Philippi. We would expect that this imprisonment would have been a great suffering for them. However, Paul and Silas were not suffering there in prison—they were enjoying the jubilee. They were singing and praising the Lord. Although they were in prison, they had enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hR1Jkh6fGpavWnsBWxqfDk6A95DtKL_27Gp4pGUAt4ZXghu0FgoVfq59grebM748A">A MISTAKEN CONCEPT</h2><p data-content-id="UwoI3MPYw_sWGgTUZRo7WwlGshtzOQ5LUvhTMmv7LdK1FIytONjnEzyH0ZWFVMBnz"> As believers, we should not have the concept that because we are saved, love the Lord Jesus, have given everything to <span class="pg" data-page-id="591" id="591">[591]</span> Him, and want to do everything for Him, our environment will be prosperous. No Christian should have this thought. If this is our philosophy of the Christian life, we need to abandon it. Such a view is absolutely wrong. </p>

Now in this Life-study we want to cover two more vital matters—the Man-Savior’s resurrection and His ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="B-xax8NKp7LCijI7QuAMgu5os3kSlmvYlicWUqjousBPGePPVlOH7nulgHhpJQvmR"> According to the Bible, three matters related to the Man-Savior are of particular importance. These matters are His death, resurrection, and ascension. Along with the Lord’s Person, these are clearly revealed in the Bible.

<p data-content-id="xdxTxFZ3QLG06tmoTaAOEYKoarNeZMRzYj39H4NLabyTJr4rWTMePzQvvgQ8LEOaY"> The Person of Christ is, of course, a great mystery. This mystery is related to and involves the Divine Trinity. This means that when we consider the Person of Christ, we cannot avoid the Divine Trinity. </p>
<p data-content-id="rR_dpE6vYaDaPaCKl1lugxdGNcFtz_3rupQBp4xmcb2zrtZinaTEqSTzFHUuwqBbj"> Christ’s all-inclusive redemptive work includes His incarnation. His redemptive work began with His incarnation and was completed in His resurrection. All that Christ did during His thirty-three and a half years on the earth was part of His redemptive work. I believe that in this Life-study we have covered Christ’s incarnation rather thoroughly. In the Life-study messages on both Mark and Luke we have spoken much regarding Christ’s human living. Eventually, we were brought to the end of Christ’s redemptive work with the three vital and crucial matters of His death, resurrection, and ascension. <span class="pg" data-page-id="596" id="596">[596]</span> </p>

This means that He died as the Lamb of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71401" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>), a man in the flesh, a man in the old creation, the serpent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71402" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span>), the Firstborn of all creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71403" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Col. 1:15</span>), the Peacemaker (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71404" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">Eph. 2:15</span>), and a grain of wheat (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71405" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="f5f0VDzn9jkRQSn1Iylf8aRwlK3eq6Siv45D3Z1PVOSaG41wTyIuG2c1MeKQAjvFj"> A simple way to remember the aspects of the Man-Savior’s sevenfold status in His death is to recall the three aspects mentioned in the Gospel of John. First we are told that Christ was the Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world; second, that He was typified by the brass serpent; and third, that He was the grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died. The Lamb of God took away our sin, the One typified by the brass serpent destroyed the old serpent, Satan, and the grain of wheat released the divine life. Hallelujah, sin has been taken away, Satan has been destroyed, and the divine life has been released! </p>
<p data-content-id="IpVW-KDk2ZPgTnA3dDDrR5F6ISFzZIDAsieA6ADySAHJiaJ_KT5O4yrRjpf5t_Bzi"> Having seen these aspects from the Gospel of John, we may go on to consider the remaining four aspects. Christ died on the cross as the Firstborn of all creation. In this aspect of His status, He brought the entire old creation with Him to the cross. Christ also died as a man, the last Adam, bringing the old man to the cross. Furthermore, He was crucified as a man in the flesh. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71406" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">Second Corinthians 5:21</span> says that He was made sin for us. Sin is related to the flesh. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71407" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Romans 8:3</span> says that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin. On the cross He condemned sin in the flesh. Finally, Christ died as the Peacemaker, the One who abolished the ordinances of human culture and living. Hence, on the cross Christ was the Lamb, the serpent, the grain of wheat, a man in the flesh made sin for us, the last Adam, that is, a man in the old creation, the Firstborn of creation, and the Peacemaker. In this sevenfold status He died as our Redeemer. </p>
<p data-content-id="HjWwmoGOlsak0TUDUDi_sdlVb6Y9pPEtBKlHqojq6TpIxbKDnyfW41Pa33wfqt__Y"> Just as we have considered the Man-Savior’s sevenfold status in His death, we also need to see a number of points concerning His resurrection and ascension. It is difficult to <span class="pg" data-page-id="597" id="597">[597]</span> find a book that speaks of the Lord’s sevenfold status in His death. Likewise, it is also difficult to find a writing that covers all the various matters we shall see regarding the Lord’s resurrection and ascension. Many of these matters are neglected in today’s teachings. Hence, in the Lord’s recovery we have the burden to cover them. Nothing that we share in these messages is the product of our imagination. On the contrary, every point comes from the divine Word. All that we have seen concerning Christ’s death, resurrection, and ascension comes from diligent study of the Word under the divine light. </p>
<p data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IOJRFFycrPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW"> When we consider the Man-Savior’s resurrection, we need to humble ourselves and empty ourselves of preoccupying thoughts. For example, we need to realize that Christ’s resurrection has nothing to do with the things of Easter, such as colored eggs. </p>
<p data-content-id="kAQNthUaZvalgvsKAvTCdAMJbCrdyQWj0UWwMbQUlst1TdatH57vU3-PT1x1LNEeo"> Regarding the Lord’s resurrection, there are two main aspects: the objective aspect and the subjective aspect. With both the objective and subjective aspects there are a number of points. In this message and the message following we shall cover the objective aspect of Christ’s resurrection. Then we shall go on to consider the subjective aspect, the aspect of the Lord’s resurrection that involves something that needs to be wrought into our being. </p>

By resurrection God vindicated and approved the Man-Savior; God also vindicated and approved the Lord’s redemptive work. In other words, God vindicated the Person and work of the Man-Savior. </p>

<p data-content-id="baXaoDjM31g4vdogNOo_AmJsY6kl2rRDOpin976WeiNY5gEGyluhr_T3XIAmn92Sv"> This certainly was the situation with the Lord Jesus. According to the four Gospels, there was much criticism, especially from the Jewish leaders, of Christ’s Person and deeds. Concerning His Person, some said that He was a Samaritan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71408" data-verses="John 8:48">John 8:48</span>), that He was beside Himself, that is, mentally ill (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71409" data-verses="Mark 3:21">Mark 3:21</span>), and that He was demon possessed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71410" data-verses="John 8:49">John 8:49</span>). Furthermore, His works were condemned by the Pharisees as a blasphemy to God. The religious leaders surely denied, rejected, and condemned the Man-Savior. They sentenced Him to death and had Him crucified. This was the attitude of the leaders of the Jewish nation, those among whom Christ was born, lived, and worked. </p>
<p data-content-id="qMcyXCf9JxgO6C4J7XfI19utWR45eDmy97SasR1HjYltLhBmhnwtFer_oxArsFU1X"> The religious leaders regarded the Man-Savior as worse than a criminal and a murderer, as someone worse than Barabbas. They condemned both Him and His work; they rejected both His Person and His deeds. Their rejection of the Man-Savior was to such an extent that they sentenced Him to be put on the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="y695EWmpNHnEWPC-prz1B1WJ3jSUoQBFyaZAx96FqVB_sFX0OYnWKsHhj6JUg1n-e"> Suppose the Man-Savior had not been resurrected. Suppose His body was left in the tomb. If so, then the Jewish leaders would have won the case. However, God resurrected Christ and thereby vindicated Him. This kind of vindication was extraordinary. After the Lord was crucified and buried, God raised Him up from the dead. </p>

For example, referring to the Lord Jesus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71411" data-verses="Acts 2:24">Acts 2:24</span> says, “Whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71412" data-verses="Acts 2:32">Acts 2:32</span> says, “This Jesus God raised up, of which we all are witnesses.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71413" data-verses="Acts 3:15">Acts 3:15</span> speaks of “the Author of life...whom God raised from the dead,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71414" data-verses="Acts 4:10">4:10</span> tells of “Jesus Christ the Nazarene...whom God raised from the dead.” Other verses in Acts that speak of God raising up Jesus from among the dead are <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71415" data-verses="Acts 5:30">5:30</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71416" data-verses="Acts 10:40">10:40</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71417" data-verses="Acts 13:30">13:30</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71418" data-verses="Acts 13:33-34">33-34</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71419" data-verses="Acts 13:37">37</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71420" data-verses="Acts 17:31">17:31</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71421" data-verses="Acts 26:8">26:8</span>. The reason this is repeated <span class="pg" data-page-id="599" id="599">[599]</span> so often is that the entire book of Acts is a book of the testimony of the resurrection of Christ. The apostles’ testimony was that of the resurrection of the Man-Savior. God vindicated Christ by raising Him up. </p>

The religious leaders thought that they were through with Him and that they could now joyfully be at rest. But God came in to resurrect the Lord Jesus. God did not argue with the religious leaders; He did not have a conference to negotiate with them. Instead, God seemed to say, “I don’t care to talk to you foolish ones. I shall do one thing—I shall raise up the very One you crucified. My raising Him up is my vindication of Him and His work, but it is a shame to those who condemned Him.” </p>
<p data-content-id="B-xax8NKp7LCijI7QuAMl9pos3kSlmvYlicWUqjousBPGePPVlOH7nulgHhpJQvmR"> The Lord Jesus was the turning point of human history. What He did has affected the whole world. Through resurrection, God, the supreme Judge, vindicated the Man-Savior and His redemptive work. </p>

On the one hand, the New Testament says that God raised Jesus up from the dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71441" data-verses="Acts 3:15">Acts 3:15</span>). On the other hand, the New Testament also tells us that Christ rose up Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71442" data-verses="Acts 10:41">Acts 10:41</span>). Regarding the Lord as a man, the New Testament tells us that God raised Him from the dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71443" data-verses="Romans 8:11">Rom. 8:11</span>). But considering Him as God, the New Testament declares that He Himself rose from the dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71444" data-verses="Romans 14:9">Rom. 14:9</span>). God raised up Christ as a proof of His vindication and approval of the Lord and His work. But as a proof of His success in His achievements, the Lord Jesus Himself rose from the dead. </p>

They may have said to one another, “What can we do? Now that the Lord has been crucified and has been buried, we cannot do anything. Everything is over.” The reason the disciples felt this way is that nothing nullifies a person’s success more than his burial. However, the Lord Jesus did not remain in the tomb. On the third day He rose up and appeared to the disciples. </p>
<p data-content-id="hR1Jkh6fGpavWnsBXzqfAkaA95DtKL_27Gp4pGUAt4ZXghu0FgoVfq59grebM748A"> When the Lord Jesus appeared to the disciples as recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71446" data-verses="Luke 24:1">Luke 24</span>, He said to them, “Do you have anything to eat here?

<p data-content-id="UwoI3MPYw_sWGgTUYTo7VxFGshtzOQ5LUvhTMmv7LdK1FIytONjnEzyH0ZWFVMBnz"> According to the New Testament, the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples on the day of His resurrection to do two main things: first, to breathe the Spirit into the disciples (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71448" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>); second, to eat with them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71449" data-verses="Luke 24:41-43">Luke 24:41-43</span>). Unable to forget what happened on the day of resurrection, Peter told those in the house of Cornelius that the Lord Jesus rose up and that the disciples ate and drank with Him. They had a feast with the resurrected Man-Savior. The Lord’s resurrection was a strong evidence of His success.

No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. This commandment I received from My Father.” When the Lord appeared to the disciples after His resurrection, He may have said something like this: “My resurrection is the proof of My success. I was not killed—I laid down My life. If I were not willing to lay down My life, no one would be able to do anything to Me. I laid down My life according to My Father’s commandment, and after three days I took it again. The Father commanded Me to lay down My life for you, and I did this. Then He commanded Me to rise up, and I arose. Now as a proof of My success I am here with you.” </p>

If the Lord had done so many things during His lifetime but did not rise up from the dead, His remaining in the tomb would have been a sign of failure. But His rising up is the evidence of His great success in whatever He did. God raised up Christ for vindication and approval. But the Lord Himself rose up as a sign of His success. </p>

The Man-Savior overcame death and destroyed Satan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71454" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Heb. 2:14</span>). The keys of death and of Hades are now in His hand (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71455" data-verses="Revelation 1:18">Rev. 1:18</span>), and He is victorious over the grave. </p>

He not only defeated death—He nullified it. Through His resurrection, death has become of none effect; death has lost its power, even its taste. Christ could nullify death because He destroyed the Devil, the one who has the power of death. Of course, by overcoming Satan and nullifying death, the Lord Jesus also defeated Hades and the grave. Therefore, Christ’s resurrection declares that He is victorious over death, Satan, Hades, and the grave. No longer are these a problem. Therefore, Christ’s resurrection was not only God’s vindication and the Lord’s success, but also His victory over death, Satan, Hades, and the grave. Christ through His resurrection has made this troublesome group of none effect. </p>

Because this matter is difficult to understand and define, it is helpful to use the illustration of a grain of wheat (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71462" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>). There is life in a grain of wheat. When the grain is sown into the earth, it “dies.” But at the same time it grows. If a grain of wheat is not sown into the ground, it will neither die nor <span class="pg" data-page-id="607" id="607">[607]</span> grow. But a seed that is put into the ground is eventually glorified through its growth. </p>
<p data-content-id="sd53dK7V3RACxeAhaZ5aoJPJWY7CXd4lKCZrOk5KHHUk8v9DyXsEuqfotQsdDEpDq"> The principle is the same with other kinds of seeds, for example, a carnation seed. Like a grain of wheat, a carnation seed dies in the soil. But eventually it grows, rises out of the earth, and blossoms. The blossoming of a carnation flower is its glorification. Therefore, a carnation seed is fully glorified in the blossoming of a carnation flower. </p>
<p data-content-id="whXJpCNVhaMbONnpPpFlIE7V78Gr88OYrW5ZYazISocRSVFEj93Rh6WuKCXo2tcws"> According to His own word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71463" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>, the Lord Jesus was a grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died. But as He was in the ground dying, He was also growing. Eventually, in resurrection He “blossomed” and brought forth many grains. These grains are His glorification. </p>

Traditional teachings concerning the Trinity have given the impression that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—the three of the divine Godhead—are separate. According to this understanding, when the Son came to earth, the Father was left on the throne in heaven. We know from the Gospel of John that when the Son was about to die, He told His disciples that He would ask the Father to send the Spirit, who came on the day of Pentecost. However, it is supposed by some that when the Spirit came on Pentecost, the Son remained with the Father on the throne. Therefore, according to this teaching, which is very superficial, and far from being accurate, when the Son came as a man, <span class="pg" data-page-id="612" id="612">[612]</span> He left the Father on the throne. The Son then lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, died, resurrected, and ascended to the heavens. Following this, the Father sent the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. When the Holy Spirit came, He left both the Father and the Son in the heavens. This kind of teaching gives a very wrong impression concerning the Triune God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="aJBHB16Du0i39s63p9L45n_cHmEpg--JpExe5woWN23707a7BR6E28G078JPrLzJy">The Son Coming with the Father</h2><p data-content-id="baXaoDjM31g4vdogNOI_DmpsY6kl2rRDOpin976WeiNY5gEGyluhr_T3XIAmn92Sv"> The New Testament reveals that when the Son came, He came with the Father. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71487" data-verses="John 8:29">John 8:29</span> says, “He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone.” When the Son was on earth, He was not alone, for the Father was always with Him: “I am not alone, because the Father is with Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71488" data-verses="John 16:32">John 16:32</span>). The Lord Jesus even told His disciples that He was in the Father and that the Father was in Him: “Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71489" data-verses="John 14:11">John 14:11a</span>). The Son’s being in the Father and the Father’s being in the Son is a matter of coinherence, a word we need to know for the expression of the deeper truth regarding the Triune God revealed in the Scriptures. </p>
<p data-content-id="qMcyXCf9JxgO6C4J7X_I29OtWR45eDmy97SasR1HjYltLhBmhnwtFer_oxArsFU1X"> Since the Son came with the Father and the Father was even in the Son, it is not correct to say that the Son left the Father on the throne in heaven when He came to earth. Actually, it is heretical to teach that the Son came without the Father. In the Gospel of John we see that the Son was sent “from with” the Father, that is, not only from the Father but also with the Father. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71490" data-verses="John 6:46">John 6:46</span> the Lord Jesus said, “Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from God, He has seen the Father.” The Greek preposition translated “from” in this verse is <em>para,</em> by the side of. The sense here is from with. The Lord Jesus is not only <em>from</em> the Father, but also <em>with</em> the Father. We have the same thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71491" data-verses="John 7:29">John 7:29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71492" data-verses="John 16:27">16:27</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71493" data-verses="John 17:8">17:8</span>. Because the Son was sent from with the Father, the Father came when the Son came. Moreover, when the Son was on earth, the Father was not only with Him but also in Him, even as the Son was in the Father. <span class="pg" data-page-id="613" id="613">[613]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="y695EWmpNHnEWPC-prT1C02J3jSUoQBFyaZAx96FqVB_sFX0OYnWKsHhj6JUg1n-e">The Son and the Spirit</h2><p data-content-id="8rK9hZU17CqFQv_7d-cMeVDV076l38frJWrb3fYskUnsCbvB8WxSNVgXi8Bko75qT"> Furthermore, the Holy Spirit was involved in the conceiving of the Lord Jesus. Hence, the birth of Christ was directly of the Holy Spirit, for His mother, Mary, was “with child of the Holy Spirit,” for that which was begotten in her was of the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71494" data-verses="Matthew 1:18">Matt. 1:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71495" data-verses="Matthew 1:20">20</span>). Then at the age of thirty, when the Man-Savior came forth to minister, the Spirit descended upon Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71496" data-verses="Luke 3:22">Luke 3:22</span>). In His ministry the Lord preached the gospel by the Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71497" data-verses="Luke 4:18">Luke 4:18</span> we are told that He read these words from Isaiah: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to bring good news to the poor....” The Son’s preaching was the Spirit’s work. The Son never did anything by Himself. He even cast out demons by the Spirit of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71498" data-verses="Matthew 12:28">Matt. 12:28</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="0yMFLpTNFijhdJXKeAdsRUr0HDyobmW8BsYvNv_3Cioz9unzd69fVMg-p6C0n6Ifp">Not Separation But Coinherence</h2><p data-content-id="7WKyJ1T_uHk5hAsLIRM1oL8FJj4I670thJCRuFLar2G9usySzvd5B-MQRqEDy9EDO"> If we put together all these verses concerning the Son, the Father, and the Spirit, we see that when Jesus Christ was on earth He was the Triune God. Not only was the Son there, but the Father and the Spirit were there as well. Hence, He is the embodiment of the Godhead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71499" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>). Therefore, we should abandon the thought that only the Son came to earth leaving the Father and the Spirit in the heavens. What we teach concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is based on the pure word of the Bible, and the Bible cannot be defeated. </p>
<p data-content-id="_ZwqsA5v5sK5Gd_CHskVx8U-oyUvJZvrd4_dLBztnh2YyrGo-ZQKJ0rrkSkFZAXKk"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71500" data-verses="John 14:8">John 14:8</span>, Philip, our representative, said, “Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us.” Surprised by this request, the Lord replied, “Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. How is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71501" data-verses="John 14:9-10">vv. 9-10</span>). Here the Lord seems to be saying, “Why do you ask Me to show you the Father? Do you not know that if you see Me, you see the Father? You see the Father when you see Me because I am in the Father, and the Father is in <span class="pg" data-page-id="614" id="614">[614]</span> Me. Do not think that I am separate from the Father, or that the Father is far away from Me. This is a mistaken concept. Because I am in the Father and the Father is in Me, wherever I am, there the Father is also.” </p>
<p data-content-id="B-xax8NKp7LCijI7QugMm-Jos3kSlmvYlicWUqjousBPGePPVlOH7nulgHhpJQvmR"> Philip was silenced by the Lord’s answer. This gave Him the opportunity to speak further. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71502" data-verses="John 14:16-17">John 14:16-17</span> He went on to say, “And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.” When the Lord spoke these words, He was among the disciples, but He was not yet in them. He seemed to be telling them, “Now I am among you and with you. But the intention of the Triune God is that He would enter into you. It is not adequate that I be with you—I need to be in you.” Therefore, He said that He would ask the Father to give them another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, who would be in them. </p>
<p data-content-id="xdxTxFZ3QLG06tmoTagOOKqoarNeZMRzYj39H4NLabyTJr4rWTMePzQvvgQ8LEOaY"> At this point some might say, “Have you not told us that since the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son, the Son and the Father cannot be regarded as separate? But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71503" data-verses="John 14:16">John 14:16</span> the Son says that He would ask the Father to give them another Comforter. Does this not indicate that the Son and the Father are separate?” No, this does not indicate that the Son and the Father are separate. We have already seen that the Lord Himself said that He is in the Father and that the Father is in Him. This is a matter of coinherence. Therefore, what we have in the Son’s asking of the Father is not separation but coinherence. </p>

The first matter we saw relating to this subjective aspect is that the Man-Savior’s resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit in order to enter into His believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71518" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71519" data-verses="John 14:16-20">John 14:16-20</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="TNosbqa7UDYgYcvAFJ81pbJ_AhIjoMFZ1RknVLQVa51Kalz7wwEWcHnDTjWi7J3AL">THE PROCESS OF RESURRECTION</h2><p data-content-id="nV3M-hxr_PahH5f0DOnBGeLmHTm7hkZMtOU1wXRdLUKzbd2Rwvo4ANlkJXwIqXfdH"> The resurrection of the Man-Savior was a process. This process began immediately after the Lord’s birth. We should not think, therefore, that His resurrection began on the third day after His crucifixion. </p>
<p data-content-id="6v5bqSZVkxM1HMGlXPReF7W8O5Ww8o25b4qVQMP5MlzkvkTR8-sJeZYdiAzVYImAy"> If we consider the New Testament thoroughly, we shall realize that resurrection begins with death. For the thirty-three and a half years of the Lord’s human living on earth, He experienced death—death to Himself and to all things other than God. Hence, the life He lived was a life under death. </p>
<p data-content-id="10Y2CNEKWaUAkDvQwkca_1rffZ6_98e4N8ozCPPMzkmQPd2gHT1E_ldnAuur5g5vG"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71520" data-verses="Luke 12:50">Luke 12:50</span> the Man-Savior indicated that He was very constrained and desired to be released: “I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!” The Greek word translated “pressed” may also be rendered “constrained.” The Man-Savior was constrained in His flesh, which He had put on through incarnation. Therefore, He needed to die, to be baptized in <span class="pg" data-page-id="620" id="620">[620]</span> physical death, so that His unlimited and infinite divine being with His divine life might be released from within Him. The point here is that the Lord lived a life under death to Himself and that this kind of living is related to the process of resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="9ja0oN4pSUA1PfKrTQcCVw284jNQuXvNrAFRd3n77So0-KjQ2N1zKueNosjiAaC8D"> As an illustration of the fact that resurrection begins with death, let us consider once again the Lord’s word concerning Himself as a grain of wheat: “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71521" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>). When a grain of wheat is sown into the earth, it dies there. But while it is dying, it is also growing. The strange thing is this: if the grain of wheat does not die, it will not grow. Suppose a grain of wheat is placed on a table and left there. That grain of wheat will not die, and also it will not grow. In order for a grain of wheat to grow, it must be put in the ground to die. It grows by the way of dying. Without dying, a grain of wheat will never grow. </p>
<p data-content-id="jXdlQ8xxZMxS77oeH-cs32PSEOMlQ9s1jH8YQMk7cEhKguIbR9jLLFm6wFfxpAM7f"> Now we need to see that the resurrection of a grain of wheat does not begin when the wheat sprouts out from the soil. When a grain of wheat sprouts in this way, someone may say, “Look! We can see the resurrection of the grain of wheat.” It is not wrong to say that the sprouting of a wheat grain is a matter of resurrection. But the point we are making here is that the resurrection of a grain of wheat does not begin with the sprouting of the grain. Rather, its resurrection begins much earlier than this. The resurrection of a grain of wheat begins with the death of the grain. </p>
<p data-content-id="TNosbqa7UDYgYcvAFJ81vJZ_AhIjoMFZ1RknVLQVa51Kalz7wwEWcHnDTjWi7J3AL"> From the illustration of the dying and growing of a grain of wheat we can see that while Christ was dying, He was resurrecting. When did Christ’s resurrection begin? We should not say that it began three days after His crucifixion. According to the picture of a grain of wheat dying and growing, Christ’s resurrection began while He was dying. He likened Himself to a grain of wheat falling into the ground to die so that many grains might be brought forth. The Lord Jesus, like the grain of wheat, was growing, sprouting, resurrecting, even while He was dying. <span class="pg" data-page-id="621" id="621">[621]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nV3M-hxr_PahH5f0DOnBPNrmHTm7hkZMtOU1wXRdLUKzbd2Rwvo4ANlkJXwIqXfdH">DYING TO LIVE</h2><p data-content-id="6v5bqSZVkxM1HMGlXPReNom8O5Ww8o25b4qVQMP5MlzkvkTR8-sJeZYdiAzVYImAy"> Now that we have the principle that the process of the Man-Savior’s resurrection began while He was dying, we need to ask when the Lord Jesus died. Did He die only on the day of the Passover? The New Testament indicates that He began to die immediately after He was born. Throughout His years on earth, He was dying to live. Every moment of every day, He was dying. This means that while He was living in the home of a poor carpenter, He was dying. The process of His resurrection began as He was dying. </p>
<p data-content-id="RZzGEogxd1MGIsl2fZpkp3iHSdLcm5J3IdyqcTX_a5S28-G-Yz8OH2qUTV12ioiQD"> It is significant that the Lord Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71522" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span>). The Lord did not say that He is the life and the resurrection; He said first that He is the resurrection and then that He is the life. Why does resurrection come first in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71523" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span>? Resurrection is mentioned first in this verse because throughout His life the Lord Jesus was dying and resurrecting. </p>
<p data-content-id="sd53dK7V3RACxeAhaZZarJvJWY7CXd4lKCZrOk5KHHUk8v9DyXsEuqfotQsdDEpDq"> When the Lord Jesus told Martha that her brother would rise again, she replied, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71524" data-verses="John 11:24">John 11:24</span>). Here Martha prolonged the resurrection to the distant future, to a time just before the millennium. Therefore, the Lord Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life.” The Lord was indicating that He is the resurrection now, the resurrection in the present. He did not say, “I shall be the resurrection;” He said, “I <em>am</em> the resurrection.” The Lord could say this because while He was living in the human life, He was resurrecting by dying. </p>
<p data-content-id="whXJpCNVhaMbONnpPpllLHbV78Gr88OYrW5ZYazISocRSVFEj93Rh6WuKCXo2tcws"> When did the Lord’s death begin? His death began immediately after He was born. When did His resurrection begin? His resurrection began with His dying. The Man-Savior was dying to live; He lived by dying. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lj54LQasZ-K8EIg0I9ABikZk1nfFprp5qpL9M39N7uxjTamFkVxVWNhxhdjVx7yWi"> The Lord’s life on earth for thirty-three and a half years was a life of dying to live, a life of living by dying. Eventually, His death was completed on the cross, and His resurrection was completed on the third day after His crucifixion. There was a beginning of His death and also a completion of it. Likewise, there was a beginning of His <span class="pg" data-page-id="622" id="622">[622]</span> resurrection and a completion of resurrection. I encourage you to bring this matter to the Lord in prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="mFzvXUhbhqpISr0cYCNgtiF1AZG80kf7bH6haSXLEJRmHfrjBcKo82-9Gg2bAZ_94"> Praise the Lord that He was the dying-to-live Man-Savior and also the living-by-dying Man-Savior! While He was living, He was dying, and while He was dying, He was living. We may even say that while He was dying, He was resurrecting. His thirty-three and a half years on earth were a long process of death and also of resurrection. With Him resurrection and death went together. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZOnBpaevoPlkI92KILWpBtjTUxvcifQzDL7AE4fhd-GIrB27yf8bZOWtB76IdtGDS"> According to our opinion, we may think that the Lord Jesus should have said to Martha, “Do you not know that I am the life? One day I will die, and then I shall be the resurrection.” However, the Lord said that He was the resurrection and the life. The fact that He was resurrection proves that He was also life. If He had not been resurrecting, He would not have been able to live. </p>
<p data-content-id="AUNZZyVVAVOomKPrtQ2iUVu12JhGBpIJR1Zd6ilPf-0XAUbPCWwsUR_yeQ_zGl6pN"> After a person is born, does he begin to live, or does he begin to die? Actually, as soon as a human being is born, he begins to die. Death, therefore, does not come as an accident. On the contrary, death comes as a process. For some, this process is short; for others, it is very long. But whatever the case may be, all unbelievers are in the process of dying. </p>
<p data-content-id="FyPO0Bs_RXrorVGaob9dAqrFgpUWneMjMpEk0aYSfanBP0SA21ajMTzZdZb6Sdt3F"> What is our situation as believers? Are we dying or living? Today we believers are dying to live, and we are living by dying. The unbelievers only have the process of dying, but we have both dying and living, both death and resurrection. Actually, the more we die, the more we are resurrected. </p>

In other words, through the process of incarnation God put humanity upon Himself. In a similar way, in the process of resurrection certain elements were put into the Spirit. In particular, these elements include the Lord’s human living and His all-inclusive death. Therefore, resurrection was a process of transfiguration in which these elements were put into the <span class="pg" data-page-id="623" id="623">[623]</span> all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This is the Spirit who has entered into the believers. </p>

This is a matter of germination through resurrection. Concerning this, Peter says, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71544" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>). When Christ was resurrected, we His believers, were all included in Him. Hence, we were resurrected with Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71545" data-verses="Ephesians 2:6">Eph. 2:6</span>). In His resurrection, He imparted the divine life into us and made us the same as He is in life and nature. </p>

A person begins to die from the moment of birth. Although we may say that people are dying, the Bible reveals that sinners are already dead. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71546" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71547" data-verses="Ephesians 2:5">5</span> say that, as sinners, we were dead in offenses and sins. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71548" data-verses="Colossians 2:13">Colossians 2:13</span> also says that we were dead in offenses. In these verses God seems to be saying, “You may think that human beings are living. You are mistaken. Fallen human beings are not living—they are dead.” </p>
<p data-content-id="B-xax8NKp7LCijI7QvAMm8Jos3kSlmvYlicWUqjousBPGePPVlOH7nulgHhpJQvmR"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71549" data-verses="John 5:25">John 5:25</span> we see that when we preach the gospel, we are actually preaching to those who are spiritually dead: “Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear shall live.” Here we see a positive point: those who are spiritually dead still have ears to hear the voice of the Son of God. This means that the dead in spirit are still able to hear the gospel. On the one hand, the Bible tells us that fallen human beings are dead. On the other hand, the Bible says that even those who are spiritually dead can hear the gospel. It is of God’s mercy and sovereignty that the dead have ears to hear the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="xdxTxFZ3QLG06tmoTbAONKKoarNeZMRzYj39H4NLabyTJr4rWTMePzQvvgQ8LEOaY"> When a spiritually dead person hears the gospel, he may say, “I believe in Jesus; I love Him.” Then as he calls on the name of the Lord Jesus, the divine life is imparted to him, and he is germinated to become a new creation. </p>

But from the time of our germination we began to be the new creation. The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, which consists of believers born again of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71550" data-verses="John 1:13">John 1:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71551" data-verses="John 3:15">3:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71552" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Pet. 1:4</span>), does have the divine life and nature.

We, the believers in Christ, who have been germinated through His resurrection, are <span class="pg" data-page-id="627" id="627">[627]</span> now the new creation. The old creation does not have God in it. But the new creation begins by God coming into us in the way of germination. Praise the Lord that we have been germinated! This germination is the impartation of the divine life into the believers. Through this impartation of the divine life we were regenerated. Therefore, germination is the impartation of the divine life into the believers for their regeneration. The second point related to the subjective aspect of the Man-Savior’s resurrection is that it is His germination of the new creation to impart the divine life into the believers for their regeneration. </p>
<p data-content-id="K6HmpZJGTPRsiY1am1eYBCZ34UlqtsBFDVHQgSo9S8is_l13ggA-7Yse3XgT2zYV3"> Perhaps we did not realize what happened to us when we were regenerated. Now we see that when we were regenerated we were germinated. We may say that this germination was a divine injection. The divine life was “injected” into us at the time we believed in Christ and were regenerated, and that injection was our germination. Hallelujah, the divine life has been injected, infused, into our inner being! That infusion was our rebirth, our regeneration. </p>

<p data-content-id="454lFLK2tydPg5el4GmBbfHpHQtD5QB0eD81SP4uSuDpX_AQORq44Je3A02kXbzxC"> As an illustration of the Lord’s propagation through resurrection, consider a grain of wheat that falls into the earth and dies. After a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it grows up and becomes many grains. The many grains are the multiplication of the one grain, and this multiplication is the propagation of that grain of wheat. </p>

Through His death and resurrection the Lord Jesus certainly has been multiplied and propagated. This propagation is for producing His reproduction, and the reproduction <span class="pg" data-page-id="628" id="628">[628]</span> of Christ is the church.

God’s great power that operated in Christ first raised Him from among the dead. This power has overcome death, the grave, and Hades, where the dead are held. Due to God’s resurrection power, death and Hades could not hold Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71560" data-verses="Acts 2:24">Acts 2:24</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="crbZLnwlQe1t-R2NLHEjsKgIu5vZMDiBZWVp3fX5a8i7iFrksEzKqpk9CFqNeA0KZ"> Second, God’s power that operated in Christ seated Him at God’s right hand in the heavenlies far above all. God’s right hand, where Christ has been seated by the surpassing great power of God, is the most honorable place, with the supreme authority. The “heavenlies” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71561" data-verses="Ephesians 1:20">verse 20</span> refers not only to the third heaven, the highest place in the universe, where God dwells, but also to the state and atmosphere of the heavens, in which Christ was seated by God’s power. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y58zRdwVwZdOug4OntHYUzui5YTN0tMwYIpE2xtAxeB5rWIwx_UI_h1Cxbmt9gLsn"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71562" data-verses="Ephesians 1:21">verse 21</span>, Christ has been seated far above all rule, authority, power, lordship, and every name. Rule refers to the highest office, authority to every kind of official power (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71563" data-verses="Matthew 8:9">Matt. 8:9</span>), power to the might of authority, and lordship to the preeminence which power establishes. The ascended Christ has been seated by the great power of God above all rules, authorities, powers, and lordships in the entire universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="EnWCv_eiedBm6acXdTwA3gI36_MxGVx9OO_VMk3ydCyoMCmwj4AjjstBnWwxvP728"> Furthermore, Christ is seated above every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is coming. <span class="pg" data-page-id="629" id="629">[629]</span> Here “every name” refers not only to titles of honor but also to everything that has a name. Christ has been seated far above everything, not only the things in this age, but also in the coming age. </p>
<p data-content-id="DoAIPBJjBHkq_0FWc4DCjcOpXz6H4o4mOlsgbBKk_d-ko1FGk9fqp5bptFLQcr1Cs"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71564" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22">Ephesians 1:22</span> continues, “And He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.” Third, God’s great power that operated in Christ has subjected all things under His feet. To be far above all is one thing; to have all things subjected under Christ’s feet is another. The former is a matter of Christ’s transcendency; the latter is a matter of the subjection of all things to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="SlZ9LfzTj9oNzJ6-qaC1L52-FtUqhJ-Hu1E2vmyVDkctfWDUrJm1vTh_wbOlz4rGj"> Fourth, God’s great power that operated in Christ gave Him to be Head over all things to the church. The headship of Christ over all things is a gift from God to Him. It was through God’s surpassingly great power that Christ received the headship in the whole universe. It was as a man, in His humanity with His divinity, that Christ was raised up from the dead, was seated in the heavenlies, had all things subjected to Him, and was given to be Head over all things. </p>

Concerning the subjective aspect, we have seen that Christ’s resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit to enter into His believers, His germination of the new creation to impart the divine life into His believers for their regeneration, and His propagation to produce the church as His reproduction. This message is the conclusion to the series of messages on the subjective aspect of Christ’s resurrection. The concluding point is that the Man-Savior’s resurrection issues in His living within us. The result of the Man-Savior’s transfiguration, germination, and propagation is that He lives in His believers. </p>

Hallelujah, we all have been germinated with the “divine germ!” It is a fact that, as those who have been germinated with the Triune God, we have this divine germ within us. Because we have been germinated through the Man-Savior’s resurrection, we have been regenerated (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71578" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>). </p>

But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71579" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span>, after the breathing of the life-giving Spirit as the breath into the disciples, there were at least one hundred twenty-one “Christs.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71580" data-verses="Acts 1:1">chapter one</span> of Acts, these one hundred twenty-one—the one hundred twenty disciples plus the Lord Jesus—had a long prayer meeting lasting ten days. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71581" data-verses="Acts 1:1">Acts 1</span> one hundred twenty-one Christs met together to pray.

Christ Himself is resurrection, and the reality of resurrection is the life-giving Spirit. Actually, the life-giving Spirit is the resurrection. Christ in <span class="pg" data-page-id="635" id="635">[635]</span> resurrection is the resurrection itself, and this resurrection is the life-giving Spirit. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71583" data-verses="John 14:16-17">verses 16 and 17</span> the Lord Jesus says, “I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71584" data-verses="John 14:16">verse 16</span>, the Lord Jesus will ask the Father to give the disciples another Comforter. The Son was the first Comforter. Therefore, the first Comforter asked the Father to send another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, who will be in us. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71585" data-verses="John 14:18">verse 18</span> the Lord goes on to say, “I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.” When taken together with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71586" data-verses="John 14:18">verse 17</span>, this indicates “He” who is the Spirit of reality in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71587" data-verses="John 14:17">verse 17</span> becomes the “I” who is the Lord Himself in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71588" data-verses="John 14:18">verse 18</span>. This indicates that after His resurrection the Lord became the Spirit of reality. Then, referring to the day of His resurrection, the Lord says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71589" data-verses="John 14:20">John 14:20</span>, “In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.” Here the Lord clearly says “I in you,” revealing that He Himself will be in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="-L1fy_zrwSJXUU5n7u3TQTRsvBf8gL-7zbw6oEqqqLY7uMvSfrnIP_SgjrRC490ZA"> As the Lord lives in us, He does not cease to be in the Father. On the one hand, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71590" data-verses="John 14:20">John 14:20</span> He says, “I am in My Father;” on the other hand, He says, “I in you.” The Lord certainly is not saying, “When I come into you, I shall cease to be in the Father.” On the contrary, here the Lord seems to be saying, “When I come into you, I shall come into you with the Father. Not only am I in the Father, but the Father also is in Me. Therefore, when I am in you, the Father who is in Me is also in you.” </p>
<p data-content-id="pQRuKAJlDonWZe7uUYxG1fCH2ZE-H030jYTeXH3ooRncRbKpIKHOqeYDJyj9C--Un"> This understanding of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71591" data-verses="John 14:20">verse 20</span> is proved by the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71592" data-verses="John 14:23">verse 23</span>: “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, <span class="pg" data-page-id="636" id="636">[636]</span> and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.” Here the Father and the Son making an abode with us is equal to the phrase “I in you” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71593" data-verses="John 14:20">verse 20</span>. Who is in us? The “I” who is in us is not only the Son, but the Son with the Father. But what about the Spirit? In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71594" data-verses="John 14:26">John 14:26</span> the Lord Jesus speaks of “the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name.” The Son came in the Father’s name (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71595" data-verses="John 5:43">John 5:43</span>) because the Son and the Father are one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71596" data-verses="John 10:30">John 10:30</span>). Now we see that the Spirit is sent in the Son’s name because the Spirit and the Son also are one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71597" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>). This is the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—reaching us as the Spirit. Hence, when the Spirit comes, the Son and the Father also come. </p>
<p data-content-id="vOVAPClIw9o-SMbO6MFlH3yn2shm1hmqQ-J4zvC1dCk_Dq1MQU0ZikmVpJu7Jramo"> When we put these verses together, we see that the One who is within us is not simple. No doubt, this One is the Son, but this is the Son in whom the Father is, and also the Son who is coming with the Spirit. Therefore, eventually we see that “I” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71598" data-verses="John 14:20">John 14:20</span> is the Triune God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="WVNqXX68ZMdi0Is0P3SrCbWMw6vNnBJsEhQPV8kOVHacHdtLj25qcwOhqs0Rn3f7G">Seeing the Lord Because He Lives in Us</h2><p data-content-id="2tNCATtNEU-uXYvQsMA4ll3qLxK2yI2K223oVb_0w5iwpZu36YT9EiPenSev2WCos"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71599" data-verses="John 14:19">John 14:19</span> the Lord Jesus says, “Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you shall live also.” If the Lord had remained in the tomb, He would not have lived, and the disciples would not have seen Him again. But this verse indicates that because He lives we shall see Him. He said that He would rise up and live and that we also shall live. What does this mean? In order to understand this verse, we need to study the entire New Testament. The Lord’s word, “You behold Me; because I live, you shall live also,” means, “I shall live in you to make you live.” Here the Lord Jesus is telling us that after His resurrection He would live in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="uZQjh9ACdCObo73nHjamZLQDnu18yBYq6-Sf_S2e8ePelXrhqcHNu9IrQr-mDbhX0"> At this point let me ask you a question: have you seen the Lord Jesus? Some might answer this question by saying that they have seen the Lord Jesus in the saints, the believers. One who answers the question in this way does not have the proper understanding of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71600" data-verses="John 14:19">John 14:19</span>. The Lord does not say in this verse, “You behold Me because you see Me in other <span class="pg" data-page-id="637" id="637">[637]</span> believers.” Rather, the Lord’s word indicates that we see Him because He lives in us. We live because He lives. This means that we live because He lives in us to make us live. </p>

First we shall give a description of the Lord’s ascension. Then we shall consider both the objective and the subjective aspects of His ascension. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8rK9hZU17CqFQv_7d_cMYGzV076l38frJWrb3fYskUnsCbvB8WxSNVgXi8Bko75qT">THE MAN-SAVIOR’S INAUGURATION<br/>INTO HIS HEAVENLY OFFICE</h2><p data-content-id="0yMFLpTNFijhdJXKeBdsYHr0HDyobmW8BsYvNv_3Cioz9unzd69fVMg-p6C0n6Ifp"> The Man-Savior’s ascension is His inauguration into His heavenly office through the process of creation, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection as God and man, as the Creator and the creature, and as the Redeemer, the Savior, and the life-giving Spirit, to execute God’s administration and to carry out God’s New Testament economy (dispensation). </p>
<p data-content-id="7WKyJ1T_uHk5hAsLIQM1gYsFJj4I670thJCRuFLar2G9usySzvd5B-MQRqEDy9EDO"> If we would understand the Man-Savior’s ascension, we need to see that it is His inauguration into His heavenly office. This inauguration required a lengthy process that began with creation and continued with incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. This process involved the Man-Savior as God, man, Creator, creature, Redeemer, Savior, and life-giving Spirit. The Lord Jesus was inaugurated to execute God’s administration and to carry out God’s New Testament economy. In the objective aspect, the Lord’s ascension caused Him to be crowned with glory and honor (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71608" data-verses="Hebrews 2:9">Heb. 2:9</span>) and to be enthroned for God’s administration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71609" data-verses="Hebrews 12:2">Heb. 12:2</span>) and made Him the Lord to possess all and the Christ to carry out God’s commission. <span class="pg" data-page-id="642" id="642">[642]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="O6A_Zpet8NpkAD12xy3VI9X96Jkgmribh2Ghh9n9QaeX9vJyetjJM0RwCL0BYvdJK"> Have you ever heard that Christ had an inauguration and that His inauguration was His ascension? Some may respond to this question by saying that the word “inauguration” cannot be found in the Bible. It is, of course, correct to say that this word is not in the Scriptures, but the fact of the Man-Savior’s inauguration is there nonetheless. The expression “the Triune God” likewise is not in the Bible, but it is a fact that the Bible reveals the Triune God. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71610" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> speaks of baptizing believers “into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” In like manner, the New Testament reveals the fact of Christ’s inauguration. Consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71611" data-verses="Acts 2:36">Acts 2:36</span>: “Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified.” In this verse the word “made” can be understood to mean “inaugurated.” Hence, Christ’s inauguration is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71612" data-verses="Acts 2:36">Acts 2:36</span>. If we read the preceding verses, we shall see that there the Lord’s ascension is mentioned. In His ascension God inaugurated Jesus Christ into His heavenly ministry. This means that in His ascension, in His inauguration, God made Him Lord and Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="454lFLK2tydPg5el4GGBbdHpHQtD5QB0eD81SP4uSuDpX_AQORq44Je3A02kXbzxC">THE MAN-SAVIOR’S STATUS AS THE ASCENDED ONE</h2><p data-content-id="ov0pwXq8uOJOycOiC1qN-c2IpYzHGrTUx1Dbcc3jku5CrgeFN6HqgZR5btlLER604"> As the One inaugurated into His heavenly office through His ascension, the Man-Savior has a wonderful status. He is both God and man, both the Creator and a creature. Some theologians would agree that Christ is God, man, and the Creator, but would deny the fact that He is also a creature. However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71613" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Colossians 1:15</span> says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, indicating that with respect to His humanity He is a creature. But due to the heresy of Arius, which was condemned at the Council of Nicea in A.D. 325, many are reluctant to say that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71614" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>, Christ is a creature. In this verse we are told that Christ is the image of God, the Firstborn of all creation. If this verse were not in the Bible, we would not presume to say that Christ is both the Creator and a creature. However, this verse is the basis for saying that Christ is a creature as well as the Creator. </p>
<p data-content-id="37AX-gTuAtUIfnNeJXKh6nFkDbtYWR3LTu6iLVxczyu6wYZF7FopoaS4d9S_W-BJ4"> If we say that Christ is both God and man, then we must <span class="pg" data-page-id="643" id="643">[643]</span> also say that He is both the Creator and a creature, for God is the Creator and man is a creature. However, some theologians say that Christ is both God and man, and then say that He is only the Creator, not a creature. How ridiculous! Is man not a creature? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71615" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span> indicates that the Lord Jesus had blood and flesh. Are blood and flesh not created things? If you deny that Christ is a creature, you are actually denying that He came in the flesh. Denying that Christ has come in the flesh is a heresy condemned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71616" data-verses="1John 4:1">chapter four</span> of 1 John. </p>
<p data-content-id="Gn7ewN6nSdByHJgqgSXgXUUOe-1UTJncAcUqo6emH0AAxLxRlyu8isObL6a-GDD-q"> Years ago, some in Hong Kong were proclaiming, “Our Christ is the Creator; He is not a creature.” When I heard about this, I told the saints, “It is very wrong to say that Christ is the Creator but not a creature. If you say that Christ is not a creature, then you are also saying that He did not become a man. But since Christ became a man, He also became a creature, because man is a creature.” Our Christ, whom God inaugurated into the heavenly office, is both God and man. He is the creature as well as the Creator. Furthermore, He is the Redeemer, the Savior, and the life-giving Spirit. What a wonderful status He has! What qualifications He possesses! </p>
<p data-content-id="crbZLnwlQe1t-R2NLHkjvLAIu5vZMDiBZWVp3fX5a8i7iFrksEzKqpk9CFqNeA0KZ"> Many Christians do not realize what kind of status and qualifications Christ has as the ascended One. However, I can testify that whenever I contact the Lord, I realize that He is God, man, the Creator, a creature, the Redeemer, the Savior, and the life-giving Spirit. Because I have this realization concerning the Lord, sometimes I am beside myself with joy when I contact Him. I can even say that I am sometimes “electrified” by the Spirit when I think of what Christ is. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y58zRdwVwZdOug4OntnYXzOi5YTN0tMwYIpE2xtAxeB5rWIwx_UI_h1Cxbmt9gLsn"> Have you ever considered that Christ is not God in part but the whole God? He is not only God the Son but also God the Father and God the Spirit. Hence, Christ is the whole God, the Triune God. Furthermore, He is a tripartite man. Therefore, as the Triune God and the tripartite man, He is the whole God and a perfect man. Let us all learn to say, “My Savior is the Triune God and a tripartite man. He is the Creator and also a creature. He is the Redeemer and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="644" id="644">[644]</span> life-giving Spirit, and this life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.” The more we realize this, the more we shall be “electrified” and beside ourselves with joy in the Lord. </p>

Christ is now on the throne to administrate the entire universe. He is the unique Administrator, the King of kings and the Lord of lords. All the rulers of the earth are under Him. He is the Administrator to execute God’s administration and also to carry out God’s New Testament economy. His administrating is related to the universe, but His carrying out of God’s New Testament economy is to propagate Himself for His reproduction to build up the church, His Body, which will issue in the New Jerusalem. How wonderful! </p>
<p data-content-id="SlZ9LfzTj9oNzJ6-qai1I6W-FtUqhJ-Hu1E2vmyVDkctfWDUrJm1vTh_wbOlz4rGj"> What we have covered thus far is an introductory word concerning the Man-Savior’s ascension. Let us now go on to consider the objective aspect of Christ’s ascension. </p>

<p data-content-id="5xKEgdpuEwfEMeypIUZXySqMqK2Fa2tvJZgq5hBR6INjxpLJ7ifzk23cJPGz7OALQ"> In His ascension the Man-Savior was crowned with glory and honor. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71617" data-verses="Hebrews 2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span> says, “But we see Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor.” Here glory and honor are considered a crown. Glory is the splendor related to Jesus’ person; honor is the preciousness related to Jesus’ worth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71618" data-verses="1Peter 2:7">1 Pet. 2:7</span>). Here we may also point out that the Lord’s dignity is related to His position (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71619" data-verses="2Peter 1:17">2 Pet. 1:17</span>). As the ascended One crowned with glory and honor, Christ is in a state of glory and has a rank of honor. <span class="pg" data-page-id="645" id="645">[645]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="NIP9vcQSpsaW9kg21I3rZsuUIxlFrb3RZvwz6cWaDdxDBDLgKxxI62zDhQMwvPdhT"> It is always an honor for a person to have a high rank. For example, the principal of the school has a high rank, and that rank is his honor. But a janitor, on the contrary, does not have any rank or honor. Christ is glorious in state and honorable in rank. He is above all kings and rulers; this is His honor. He has received such a glory and has entered into such an honor. This glory and honor are the crown with which He has been crowned. </p>

The Man-Savior was inaugurated as God and man, as the Creator and a creature, and as the Redeemer, the Savior, and the life-giving Spirit to execute God’s administration and to carry out God’s New Testament economy. Considering the objective aspect of Christ’s ascension, we saw that in His ascension He was crowned with glory and honor (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71634" data-verses="Hebrews 2:9">Heb. 2:9</span>), enthroned for God’s administration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71635" data-verses="Hebrews 12:2">Heb. 12:2</span>), and made the Lord to possess all and the Christ to carry out God’s commission (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71636" data-verses="Acts 2:36">Acts 2:36</span>). </p>

This is wonderful, but it seems to be something too high for me and too far away from me. What does this have to do with me?” In answering such a question we need to realize that the very Christ in resurrection, the pneumatic Christ, lives in us. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71637" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>, in His resurrection Christ came back to the disciples to breathe Himself into them. But according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71638" data-verses="Mark 16:1">Mark 16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71639" data-verses="Luke 24:1">Luke 24</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71640" data-verses="Acts 1:1">Acts 1</span>, the Lord ascended to the heavens so that something further could take place. If His relationship with us ceased with His breathing <span class="pg" data-page-id="648" id="648">[648]</span> Himself into us, it would be difficult for Him to work out anything for the accomplishment of God’s New Testament economy. After breathing Himself into the disciples, it was still necessary for Him to be inaugurated into His heavenly office. </p>
<p data-content-id="454lFLK2tydPg5el4GWBTP3pHQtD5QB0eD81SP4uSuDpX_AQORq44Je3A02kXbzxC"> We may use the election and inauguration of the President of the United States as an illustration. The President does not begin executing his presidency immediately after the election. No, he must wait until the day of inauguration, the day he is inaugurated into his office. Then, after his inauguration, he may begin to carry out his administration as President. Likewise, after the Man-Savior’s resurrection, He still needed to be inaugurated in His ascension. For fifty days after the Lord breathed Himself into the disciples, they were quiet. But after the Lord ascended to the heavens and was inaugurated into His post, a great many things began to happen, starting on the day of Pentecost. </p>
<p data-content-id="-L1fy_zrwSJXUU5n7uXTQRRsvBf8gL-7zbw6oEqqqLY7uMvSfrnIP_SgjrRC490ZA"> We need to realize the significance of the Man-Savior’s ascension. In addition to His resurrection, there is also His ascension. Now the very Christ who lives in us and works through us is not only the One in resurrection but also the One in ascension. The One in resurrection is full of life and power, but He still needs authority in ascension. After His ascension the Lord has not only life and power in resurrection but also authority in ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="pQRuKAJlDonWZe7uUYRG1dCH2ZE-H030jYTeXH3ooRncRbKpIKHOqeYDJyj9C--Un"> Apart from a proper inauguration, a government official cannot have authority. Authority comes through inauguration. Once a person has been inaugurated into a certain post, he has the authority of that office. We need to see that, as believers, we have One living in us who has not only life and power in resurrection but also authority in ascension. The very Christ in resurrection and ascension lives in us and dwells upon us. He lives in us as life, and He dwells upon us as authority. Therefore, we are now one with this Christ in His resurrection and ascension. As a result, we have life and power in resurrection and also authority in ascension. <span class="pg" data-page-id="649" id="649">[649]</span> </p>

Recently, while I was having a time with the Lord, I realized that we all need the Lord’s mercy. We may never have seen into the depths of the truths that are revealed in the Bible. Rather, we may often read the Bible in a very superficial way. We do not go below the surface to see what is in the depths. For example, we may appreciate the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71641" data-verses="Matthew 11:28">Matthew 11:28</span>: “Come to Me all who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.” When we read this verse, we may say, “Thank You, Lord. I am one who labors, one who is burdened. Lord, I come to You and ask You to give me rest.” We may understand even such a verse as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71642" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span> in a shallow way. In this verse the Lord says, ”God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.” In reading this verse, we may pay attention only to the fact that God loves the world. However, we may not study what it means to believe. We may not consider what eternal life is, or what it means to have eternal life. We may not realize that eternal life is actually the Triune God. To have eternal life, therefore, is to enjoy, participate in, and experience the Triune God. However, we may have little or no understanding of this. </p>
<p data-content-id="2tNCATtNEU-uXYvQsMg4mkXqLxK2yI2K223oVb_0w5iwpZu36YT9EiPenSev2WCos"> Reading the Bible in a superficial way can be compared to skating on the ice that covers a deep lake: the skater does not break the ice to see what is under the surface. When we read the Bible, we may “skate” on the “ice,” the surface, of the Word. We do not break through the surface, go down into the depths, and see what is revealed there. </p>
<p data-content-id="uZQjh9ACdCObo73nHj6maKwDnu18yBYq6-Sf_S2e8ePelXrhqcHNu9IrQr-mDbhX0"> Because of superficiality in the reading of the Bible, very few Christians know the matters of resurrection, ascension, and the coming down of the Spirit. Therefore, we are burdened that we all see that the Christ who is now living and working within us is the One in resurrection with life and power and also the One in ascension with authority. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="650" id="650">[650]</span> One in resurrection and ascension now lives, works, and operates in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="f5f0VDzn9jkRQSn1IzVf8bRwlK3eq6Siv45D3Z1PVOSaG41wTyIuG2c1MeKQAjvFj"> We need to be impressed with the fact that the Lord’s relationship with us does not stop with His resurrection, but goes on to His ascension. Many things happened as a result of His ascension. We have emphasized that as God, man, the Creator, a creature, the Redeemer, the Savior, and the life-giving Spirit, He has been crowned and enthroned. He has been inaugurated into His heavenly office to administrate the entire universe and to execute God’s New Testament economy. This administration and execution are not only with life and power but also with authority. He is now in us both in His resurrection and in His ascension. We all need to realize Him to such an extent. </p>

Our realization of the Lord makes a great difference in our contact with Him. This can be illustrated by our contact with people. If you do not know a person’s status and qualifications, this will influence the way you contact him. For example, if you do not know that a certain man is the principal of the school but consider him a janitor, this will surely influence the way you contact him. But if you know that he is the principal, your way of contacting him will be different. It always makes a difference in contacting others when we know their status, qualifications, position, and office. In like manner, if we know the Man-Savior’s status and office, this will affect our contact with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IOJQ1FyfrPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW"> Today many believers pray to the Lord and contact Him in a way that is far from adequate. They do not have much appreciation of the Lord’s status, position, and qualification. They do not have much understanding of the process through which He passed in order to be inaugurated into His heavenly office. </p>

It is not as easy to speak of the subjective aspect of the Man-Savior’s ascension as it is to speak of the objective aspect. Concerning the Lord’s ascension being subjective to us, I feel that I lack the utterance to express what the Lord has shown us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="SlZ9LfzTj9oNzJ6-qZC1Oqm-FtUqhJ-Hu1E2vmyVDkctfWDUrJm1vTh_wbOlz4rGj">A TRANSMISSION<br/>FROM THE ASCENDED CHRIST TO THE CHURCH</h2><p data-content-id="gIbolEPmx05b9aaM4LtXXvD6mLMAfdyt6RkK1EfHgPUcUpUKFw_EQp0WLDUU4a_bg"> We have seen that in His ascension Christ was crowned with glory and honor and enthroned for God’s administration. This means that He shares God’s throne to be the unique Administrator in the universe. Through His ascension Christ was also inaugurated to be the Lord to possess all and to be the Christ to carry out God’s commission. Since all these matters are objective, how can we prove that Christ’s ascension is related to us in a subjective way? Proof is in the fact that there is a transmission from the ascended Christ to us. I first used the word “transmission” in relation to Christ’s ascension twenty-two years ago, during a message in which I was trying to speak on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71661" data-verses="Ephesians 1:19-23">Ephesians 1:19-23</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71662" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22">Verse 22</span> says that God gave Christ “to be Head over all things to the church.” The phrase “to the church” indicates a transmission from the ascended Christ to the church, His Body. <span class="pg" data-page-id="656" id="656">[656]</span> </p>

Mainly there are three ways to translate this clause. The first way is that followed by the King James Version and the New Translation of J. N. Darby; it is also the translation in the Recovery Version. The King James Version says, “gave him to be the head over all things to the church,” and Darby’s version says, “gave Him [to be] head over all things to the assembly.” The Recovery Version, quoted above, says, “gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.” </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="SlZ9LfzTj9oNzJ6-qZC1I4W-FtUqhJ-Hu1E2vmyVDkctfWDUrJm1vTh_wbOlz4rGj">A Gift from God to Christ</h2><p data-content-id="gIbolEPmx05b9aaM4LtXe9D6mLMAfdyt6RkK1EfHgPUcUpUKFw_EQp0WLDUU4a_bg"> According to this translation, God gave Christ to be something to the church. It does not mean that God gave Christ to the church as a gift; it means that God gave Christ a gift—the headship over all things. According to this understanding, a great gift was given to Christ by God, and this great gift was the headship over all things. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="eZHFLAbNWwOTr1-IttSDphNBlkr6ZBJMGzugC7yI_anSHrEw64TAXVbz6cBzraKtb">“To the Church”</h2><p data-content-id="5xKEgdpuEwfEMeypIX5XxTKMqK2Fa2tvJZgq5hBR6INjxpLJ7ifzk23cJPGz7OALQ"> God’s giving Christ to be the Head over all things is to the church. “To the church,” as we have pointed out, implies a transmission. What God gave Christ to be is to the church; it is transmitted to the church. The church shares it. This corresponds to the word “His power toward us” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71664" data-verses="Ephesians 1:19">verse 19</span>. The phrase “toward us” is a key, for it also indicates a transmission. God’s power in the heavens is toward us; that is, His power is transmitted to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="NIP9vcQSpsaW9kg21LXratOUIxlFrb3RZvwz6cWaDdxDBDLgKxxI62zDhQMwvPdhT"> The transmission of electricity from the power plant to our homes is an illustration of the transmission of God’s power from the heavens to the church. The current of electricity flows from the power plant through wires into our homes. This current of electricity is its transmission. When the lights are on, we know that this transmission is taking place. If we go to the meter, we shall see a clear indication <span class="pg" data-page-id="657" id="657">[657]</span> that the current of electricity is flowing, that there is transmission of electricity from the power plant into our homes. </p>
<p data-content-id="tm_3_WpwudCvX6CkXqoA4tXM1GTBpy9OgG7uBMDbsNsUIce-CSAdVjV8DKlJDOLGv"> In a similar way, there is a transmission of the heavenly current of the divine electricity from the “power plant” in the third heaven to the church. As the church, we are the “building” into which the divine electricity is being transmitted. Therefore, God’s power is toward us. This means that the divine electricity is being transmitted from the heavens to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="hR1Jkh6fGpavWnsBXx6fAlaA95DtKL_27Gp4pGUAt4ZXghu0FgoVfq59grebM748A"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71665" data-verses="Ephesians 1:19">Ephesians 1:19</span> says that the transmission of God’s power toward us is “according to the operation of the might of His strength.” The phrase “according to” indicates that a track is needed for the transmission of the divine electricity. This track may be compared to the tracks on which a locomotive runs. Without a railroad track a locomotive has no way to move properly. Likewise, the heavenly, divine electricity is being transmitted into us according to a “track.” </p>
<p data-content-id="UwoI3MPYw_sWGgTUYR47VyFGshtzOQ5LUvhTMmv7LdK1FIytONjnEzyH0ZWFVMBnz"> As used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71666" data-verses="Ephesians 1:19">verse 19</span>, the phrase “according to” also indicates a model or pattern, showing us how this great power is transmitted to us. God’s power is transmitted according to the operation of the might of His strength. Here Paul, seemingly exhausting the vocabulary of the Greek language, speaks of power, operation, might, and strength. Paul uses all these words to convey something of the vastness of God’s power to us. God’s power is transmitted to us according to an operation, and this operation is of the might of His strength. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Mixvss-j9tzRFTxysd58GYRNaqOl6bARPohV1ILcl2Rfd6ZbvrtmR-ZjJ-Sa8BhLR">God’s Power Wrought in Christ</h2><p data-content-id="VnpGtuJZc2t4WkT0TZPTqLQs9FrNE0CWBPCyIGrj5PYt8QUzResVcYufIW_qbioEP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71667" data-verses="Ephesians 1:20">Ephesians 1:20</span> Paul continues, “Which He wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead, and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies.” To what does “which” refer? It refers to “power” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71668" data-verses="Ephesians 1:19">verse 19</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71669" data-verses="Ephesians 1:20">verse 20</span> Paul speaks of the power which God wrought in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="iKUb-yZjUMq0U5rbMymQVPCKhlmsitCl_HgCC1JygvKdbgTH8NQIWMexx8ZGM2f34"> From this verse through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71670" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22">verse 22</span> we see that God wrought this power in Christ by four steps: first, raising Him from among the dead; second, seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies; third, subjecting all things under His feet; and fourth, giving Him to be Head over all things to <span class="pg" data-page-id="658" id="658">[658]</span> the church. The final step of God’s working in Christ with His great power was to give Him to be the Head over all things, and what God gave Christ to be was to the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="10Y2CNEKWaUAkDvQwmsa81LffZ6_98e4N8ozCPPMzkmQPd2gHT1E_ldnAuur5g5vG">TWO OTHER TRANSLATIONS</h2><p data-content-id="9ja0oN4pSUA1PfKrTSsCWwW84jNQuXvNrAFRd3n77So0-KjQ2N1zKueNosjiAaC8D"> A second way of translating <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71671" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22">Ephesians 1:22</span> does not use the words “to be.” According to this way of rendering the verse, it would read, “gave Him, head over all things, to the church.” The verse would then mean that God has given something to the church. What has God given to the church? God has given Christ to the church as the Head over all things. One version that follows this way of translating this verse is the Concordant Literal New Testament: “gives Him, as Head over all, to the ecclesia.” Wuest in his expanded translation says the same thing: “Him He gave as Head over all things to the Church.” Dean Alford also interprets this verse to mean that God gave Christ to the church as the Head, and this Head is over all things. This second way of translating this verse would indicate after God raised Christ from among the dead, seated Him in the heavens, and subjected all things under His feet, He then gave Him to the church as the Head over all things. This would not be logical according to the sequence. The three steps of raising Christ, seating Him in the heavens, and subjecting all things under His feet are great steps. According to the second way of translating the verse, these great steps are followed by a lesser step—giving Christ to the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="jXdlQ8xxZMxS77oeH8ss03vSEOMlQ9s1jH8YQMk7cEhKguIbR9jLLFm6wFfxpAM7f"> The third way of translating <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71672" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22">Ephesians 1:22</span> says that God gave, appointed, or made Christ the Head over all things <em>for</em> the church. This is the translation in the Chinese version and also in the Berkeley Version. According to this translation, God raised Christ from among the dead, seated Him in the heavens, subjected everything under His feet, and then appointed Him to be the Head of all things for the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="TNosbqa7UDYgYcvAFLM1sI5_AhIjoMFZ1RknVLQVa51Kalz7wwEWcHnDTjWi7J3AL"> The significance of the third way of translating this verse is higher than the second and lower than the first. Of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="659" id="659">[659]</span> three ways of translating <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71673" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22">Ephesians 1:22</span>, the second way is the poorest. </p>
<p data-content-id="nV3M-hxr_PahH5f0DMXBMNLmHTm7hkZMtOU1wXRdLUKzbd2Rwvo4ANlkJXwIqXfdH"> After considering this matter carefully, I still prefer to follow the first way. God raised Christ from among the dead, seated Him in the heavens, subjected all things under His feet, and, eventually, gave Him a great gift. Vincent says that the word “gave” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71674" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22">verse 22</span> does not mean appointed or made; instead, it means to give something as a gift. Therefore, this verse is saying that God gave something to Christ. What did God give Him? God gave Him the headship over all things. After raising Christ from the dead, seating Him in the heavens, and subjecting all things under His feet, God gave Him the great gift of the headship over all things. </p>

Just as in one’s physical body the head and the body are one, so Christ, the Head, and the church, <span class="pg" data-page-id="666" id="666">[666]</span> His Body, are joined and therefore are one. It would be absurd to think that one’s head is not related to one’s body. Likewise, it would also be a mistake to think that as the Head Christ is far away from the Body. However, some think that Christ is far away from us, the members of His Body. According to this concept, the Head is in the heavens, and the Body is on earth. To those who hold this concept it seems that there is a vast distance between the Head in the heavens and the Body on earth. How, then are the Head and Body connected? This understanding of the Head and the Body is nonsensical. </p>
<p data-content-id="XZZHhlN1mQ1gX1IOJTVFydrPTLSUaroZvX9czPc1JUayCAiDs5e6zSmX3cuteXmNW"> In His ascension Christ was made the Head of the church. How can we say that the Head is in the heavens and that the church, the Body, is on earth, far away from the Head? According to the Bible, the Head is not alone in the heavens without His Body, and the Body is not on earth without the Head. The Body without the Head would be a monstrosity. </p>
<p data-content-id="kAQNthUaZvalgvsKAtDCdBMJbCrdyQWj0UWwMbQUlst1TdatH57vU3-PT1x1LNEeo"> No doubt, the Bible reveals that Christ, the Head, has ascended to the heavens. We, of course, are on earth. Then where are the Head and the Body—in heaven or on earth? The Head and the Body are one and form a universal man. But is this universal man in heaven or on earth? If you say that the Head is in heaven and the Body is on earth, you will be seriously mistaken. If this is the situation, what joins the Head and the Body? Some may say that the Head and the Body are both in heaven and on earth. But what does this mean? Does it mean that sometimes we are in heaven and that at other times we are on earth? </p>
<p data-content-id="Jgkr79uXp4nHSqPJ1FIf2M8wm7qGnaecC8bfNtJTx_m3Ubj0zJ3n8sOq8U2GgJfUN"> In answering the question concerning the location of the Head and the Body, we need to realize that this does not involve the elements of space and time. With material things there are these elements. But with divine things there is neither the element of space nor the element of time. For Christ to be the Head of the church, His Body, is certainly not a material thing; this is altogether a divine matter. With this divine matter there is not the element of space nor the element of time. Therefore, we need to see that <span class="pg" data-page-id="667" id="667">[667]</span> in the divine life and in the divine Spirit, we, the believers, are one with Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="zYdoNmJ8sJ3EfPJeFlnNjp7Y9_7RUWZfgnhUmVfdTB_5mEQTlpUx_z2KThQMh-S0-"> The Body is one with the Head in the divine life and in the divine Spirit. Regarding the Head and the Body, we should not consider space and time, for here these elements do not apply. As members of the Body in the divine life and the divine Spirit, we are not separated by space or time. We all are now in the Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="aJBHB16Du0i39s63p_745m_cHmEpg--JpExe5woWN23707a7BR6E28G078JPrLzJy"> We would emphasize the fact that with material matters we have the elements of space and time, but we do not have these elements with divine things. For example, the Lord Jesus said, “No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71707" data-verses="John 3:13">John 3:13</span>). Here the Lord says that although He came down from heaven, He was still in heaven. This means that while He was on earth, He was still in heaven. According to His physical body, He was on earth when He spoke these words. But according to His divine being, which does not involve the elements of space and time, He was in heaven. </p>
<p data-content-id="baXaoDjM31g4vdogNM4_DnpsY6kl2rRDOpin976WeiNY5gEGyluhr_T3XIAmn92Sv"> In the church life we should not consider the Head and the Body from a physical point of view. Rather, we need to consider the Head and the Body from the divine viewpoint. According to the divine viewpoint, we are one with the ascended Christ, and His ascension is also ours (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71708" data-verses="Ephesians 2:6">Eph. 2:6</span>). Here in the ascension we express Him in His fullness. </p>

We have often pointed out that this fullness is the result, the issue, of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71711" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Eph. 3:8</span>). Through the enjoyment of Christ’s riches we become His fullness to express Him. When we enjoy Christ, there will be a result of this enjoyment. The result of enjoying Christ is the fullness, and this fullness is the proper church life. In the church life, which is the fullness of Christ, the church expresses Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="668" id="668">[668]</span> This expression of Christ in the church is in the divine nature and the divine sphere. </p>
<p data-content-id="8rK9hZU17CqFQv_7d8sMeWDV076l38frJWrb3fYskUnsCbvB8WxSNVgXi8Bko75qT"> We can see from this that Christ’s ascension has much to do with us. It is in His ascension that we are one with Him. Furthermore, in His ascension, not merely in His resurrection, He is our Head and we are His Body. The New Testament does not say that it was in Christ’s resurrection that God made Him Head of the church. Rather, the Bible reveals that it was in His ascension that God made Christ the Head of the church, His Body. </p>

In His ascension He was inaugurated into His priestly office. When He was on earth, He did not carry on His priestly ministry as He is now doing in the heavens. </p>
