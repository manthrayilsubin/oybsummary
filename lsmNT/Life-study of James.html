<p class="scripture" data-content-id="-2VHxF_AgLgVwx9u2orZQaz4DlycWFxva7OZG9tT2zdkWTzUkomslY_VVBU07m3zk">Scripture Reading: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99338" data-verses="James 1:1-12">James 1:1-12</span></p><p data-content-id="pFwPagCi1CBtYCo_i1Ch4oxnEhQe--MV_oIBGzZCPV_Gd0Uregl17w5aL9aFJaOIW"> In our Life-study of the Bible we have covered all the books of the New Testament except the books of James, Mark, Luke, and Acts. Of the twenty-three books we have covered thus far, ten are especially strategic: Matthew, John, Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Hebrews, 1 John, and Revelation. We may also regard 1 and 2 Corinthians among the strategic New Testament books, bringing the number of these books to twelve. </p>
<p data-content-id="vLXobqmKfCTOj83eFKQCqMY8P5ufj026yd3A_-mbgE6bGSvvzsbUl3y01-QH5Pv3t"> I would encourage all the saints to have a thorough review of the twenty-three New Testament books we have covered in our Life-study. I would encourage you to read the Recovery Versions with the notes and cross-references and also to read the Life-study messages on each book. If you do this, you will enrich yourselves and you will also enrich the Lord’s recovery. If we are saturated with these riches, we shall be able to share these riches with others in three ways: by preaching the gospel, by presenting the truth, and by ministering life. Then if you meet someone who opposes the Lord’s recovery, you will not need to vindicate or argue. Instead, do these three things: preach the gospel, present the truth, and minister life. But in order to do these things, we ourselves must first be equipped. </p>
<p data-content-id="W7WtXlPtgrNZCLCrkmM-w6L1eOktPH64lEPWmyE5BD5VObGt2sMOZIySFfyzkddGt"> There is no doubt that the saints in the recovery love the Lord. But even though you love the Lord Jesus, you may not yet have the spiritual skill or the spiritual capital with which to preach the gospel, to present the truth, and to minister life. This is the reason I encourage you to gain the spiritual <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> education and become saturated with all the riches contained in the messages on the various New Testament books we have covered. The more you are saturated with these riches, the more you will be equipped to preach the gospel in different ways to different people. You will also be able to present the truth to other Christians. Every genuine Christian loves the truth. If you present the truth to a fellow believer, he will be attracted by it. Many of us came into the Lord’s recovery because we were attracted by the truth. Furthermore, in addition to knowing how to preach the gospel and present the truth, you will be able to minister life by testifying to others how you have experienced Christ, the all-inclusive One, as your life and life supply. </p>
<p data-content-id="2mOVbM5hMqH0CSuhHR_nmC5HdOF53B6dm0hRKYyXXsOzuiG4_X7RfLJcyXkUQN1zK"> The number of the saints in the Lord’s recovery in the United States is still small, only about eight thousand. But if all the saints in the recovery would be saturated with the riches of the Word, they would become living witnesses. Then the Lord’s recovery would have thousands of reporters, thousands of saints preaching the gospel, presenting the truth, and ministering life. Imagine what kind of work could be accomplished if we all were equipped in this way! </p>
<p data-content-id="rfusliGbPdPcLZprJ1asH3pGwKvJw_oqopc2-THiJE807T_kQ_P6OyW_KpX_-6kRP"> However, a good number of saints have not yet been equipped to preach the gospel, present the truth, or minister life. When these saints come in contact with others, it seems that they do not have the word to present to them, although they have the heart to do this. Even more are not able to minister life to others. This is the reason I encourage the saints to become saturated with the riches the Lord has given to us through the years. These riches are available for us in the Life-study messages. </p>

Believers have held different attitudes toward this book. Martin Luther, the great reformer used by the Lord to begin the recovery, said that the Epistle of James was an “epistle of straw.” However, certain Christians, especially some Chinese Christians, appreciate this book because it <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> fits in with their ethical background, a background that emphasizes ethical and moral perfection. These Christians especially appreciate the book of James in the New Testament and the book of Proverbs in the Old Testament. In the West, when the New Testament is printed separately from the Old Testament, it is often printed with the book of Psalms. But in the Orient, when the New Testament is printed separately, it often includes the book of Proverbs. It seems that Christians in the West like the Psalms, whereas Christians in the Orient like Proverbs. </p>
<p data-content-id="K2MUTydK7KZuNJgowPk8TYUVyN9pdpa2gk-Qa7_3hmi1KeUuB1JECb1QZwXOzfjqp"> According to the concept of some, the book of James is similar to the book of Proverbs. This similarity can be seen in the illustrations James uses in his Epistle: the surge of the sea (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99339" data-verses="James 1:6">1:6</span>), the flower of the grass (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99340" data-verses="James 1:10">1:10</span>), the sun with scorching heat (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99341" data-verses="James 1:11">1:11</span>). As we shall see when we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99342" data-verses="James 3:1">chapter three</span>, in dealing with the problem of the tongue, James uses twenty different items for his illustrations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99343" data-verses="James 3:3-12">3:3-12</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99344" data-verses="James 4:14">4:14</span> James uses vapor as an illustration of human life, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99345" data-verses="James 5:7">5:7</span> he uses the illustration of a farmer waiting for his crop to ripen. These illustrations give the Epistle of James a proverbial character. Therefore, those who especially appreciate the book of Proverbs also appreciate this Epistle. As we shall see later in this Life-study, I also appreciate this Epistle, but I appreciate it for a very different reason. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lV-64wrrwGJZlZgDVmvezMJNWhepNc4_RvrnQMVHb73miip0rG9RF1HxW5lhK5A6O">A SLAVE OF GOD AND OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="OVAeN2DXaqLJojqZo2IzPexkP6ZRmFwAiRRUvMwNiDYzqbFww6oRqWHaPXQNuENL2"> The Epistle of James opens like this: “James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.” James was a flesh brother of the Lord Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99346" data-verses="Matthew 13:55">Matt. 13:55</span>) and of Jude (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99347" data-verses="Jude 1:1">Jude 1</span>). He was not one of the twelve Apostles chosen by the Lord while He was on earth, but he became one of the apostles after the Lord’s resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99348" data-verses="Galatians 1:19">Gal. 1:19</span>) and the leading elder in the church at Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99349" data-verses="Acts 12:17">Acts 12:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99350" data-verses="Acts 15:2">15:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99351" data-verses="Acts 15:13">13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99352" data-verses="Acts 21:18">21:18</span>), reputed with Peter and John to be a pillar of the church, and mentioned by Paul as the first among the three pillars (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99353" data-verses="Galatians 2:9">Gal. 2:9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="45EnWoIR7NmkPb9fHC3rtdj-rtMLBuE8f8sEgUHIt-_b2sWxnUl87G2dTFzSNPMjp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99354" data-verses="James 1:1">1:1</span> James refers to himself as “a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.” Here James ranks the Lord Jesus equally with God. This was contrary to Judaism, which did not recognize the deity of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99355" data-verses="John 5:18">John 5:18</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="oApZhckfvnkF01f7RgUNlYqO4WtEvsUZRGslQ5NFHWBuYIaiDa10Ld5RbTXSNwORW"> When James was with the Lord Jesus in the flesh, he probably did not listen to Him, and at least to some extent he may have despised Him. We find an example of this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99356" data-verses="John 7:1">John 7</span>. But after the Lord’s crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, this flesh brother of the Lord Jesus became such a believer in Him that he regarded his elder brother as having the same rank as God. This was the reason James could speak of himself as a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="3VbgTLVrrvAdrpIaipPkz5FnbXAo0ZkHuqEjIs-pHsytNTNsxbIK1NHVOl5cz1kdL"> James clearly recognized the deity of the Lord Jesus. I admire James for recognizing that Jesus, his brother in the flesh, is God and for saying that he was a slave of God and of this One who is the Lord. This part of James’ writing is wonderful. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="G8SAEs1Krd9S2jsfJlLr5PXThTUMyGRHQ-1CtevHSxneBk0PBM-TI8WsV9IgWOY4X">THE TWELVE TRIBES</h2><p data-content-id="ctFQYC6UrqiZbn8l9ZTxZDttakEYxuASqryW0p9-WDbi2mDEdlC57zXU4Te-jvXCm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99357" data-verses="James 1:1">1:1</span> James goes on to say, “To the twelve tribes in the dispersion: rejoice!” The twelve tribes here refer to the tribes of Israel. This indicates that this Epistle was written to Christian Jews, who had the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99358" data-verses="James 2:1">2:1</span>) and were justified by faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99359" data-verses="James 2:24">2:24</span>), regenerated by the word of truth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99360" data-verses="James 1:18">1:18</span>), and indwelt by the Spirit of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99361" data-verses="James 4:5">4:5</span>), and who were members of the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99362" data-verses="James 5:14">5:14</span>), awaiting the Lord’s coming back (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99363" data-verses="James 5:7-8">5:7-8</span>). However, to call these believers in Christ the twelve tribes, as God’s chosen people in His Old Testament economy, may also indicate the lack of a clear view concerning the distinction between Christians and Jews, between God’s New Testament economy and the Old Testament dispensation, that God in the New Testament has delivered and separated the Jewish believers in Christ from the Jewish nation, which was then considered by God as a “perverse generation” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99364" data-verses="Acts 2:40">Acts 2:40</span>). In His New Testament economy God no longer considers the Jewish believers as Jews for Judaism but as Christians for the church. They, as the church of God, should be as distinct and separate from the Jews as from the Gentiles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99365" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:32">1 Cor. 10:32</span>). Yet, James, as a pillar of the church, in his Epistle to the Christian brothers, still called them the twelve tribes. (This may be the reason that he addressed the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99366" data-verses="James 5:1-6">5:1-6</span> to the rich class among <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> the Jews in general.) This was contrary to God’s New Testament economy. </p>

I can testify that my endurance has increased as a result of opposition and trial. The testings that we suffer produce endurance. </p>
<p data-content-id="bQia7yaJ-FE89WGzCJPyzmS9m1CNeT4exZMXdix86tnN_PWdvNRjSLRFm0BsMkGpw"> Endurance is different from patience. It is possible to be patient without having much endurance. Our patience may be fragile. What we need is an enduring patience. This enduring patience is endurance. </p>

Such perfection in Christian behavior requires the trials of God’s governmental dealing and the believers’ endurance by the virtue of the divine birth through regeneration by the implanted word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99387" data-verses="James 1:18">vv. 18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99388" data-verses="James 1:21">21</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="CycrTQag9k0ZJC-sxiHOq-nkgAmQ-JOvBxQVM-M8gJmFFFBznh2LiK2lnzzJSuqrk"> What is the difference between complete and entire? As to help in answering this question, we may use a jigsaw puzzle as an illustration. For such a puzzle to be complete means that it contains all the pieces. If even one piece of the puzzle is missing, the puzzle would not be complete. Hence, to be complete means to have every part of a full unit. A person’s body would not be complete if any part were missing. To be complete is to have all the parts or pieces of a certain unit. </p>
<p data-content-id="PqI5bcRSCMX2VJnk3PdMV1-_TxfCVjHYfSB33BKcR23qaKrC0PH--2ZbdKvG0NLNz"> But what does it mean to be entire? Using the illustration of the jigsaw puzzle, we may say that when all the pieces of the puzzle are put together, there is a whole, an entire entity. Suppose a jigsaw puzzle has a hundred pieces. If all the pieces are at hand, the puzzle is complete. Then when these pieces are put together in their proper places, the puzzle is whole or entire. Therefore, the word “entire” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99389" data-verses="James 1:4">1:4</span> denotes the whole, the entirety, of a unit. </p>
<p data-content-id="-2VHxF_AgLgVwx9u2orVQb3EDlycWFxva7OZG9tT2zdkWTzUkomslY_VVBU07m3zk"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99390" data-verses="James 1:4">1:4</span> James is not using the words complete and entire as synonyms. What James means here is that we need to have all the items of practical Christian perfection. If we have every item, we shall be complete. Following that, we shall have the entire Christian perfection; that is, we shall have practical Christian perfection as a whole. </p>
<p data-content-id="pFwPagCi1CBtYCo_i1Ct4pFXEhQe--MV_oIBGzZCPV_Gd0Uregl17w5aL9aFJaOIW"> When James’ writing touches the matter of practical Christian perfection, it is very descriptive and also detailed. On the one hand, this perfection must be complete, with every item present; on the other hand, it must be a whole, an entirety. Therefore, James ends <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99391" data-verses="James 1:4">verse 4</span> with the words “lacking in nothing.” His desire was that those who received his Epistle would be complete and entire in their practical Christian perfection, lacking in nothing. </p>

The wisdom of God is needed for practical Christian perfection. Hence, we need to ask God for it. </p>
<p data-content-id="2mOVbM5hMqH0CSuhHR_rmA9LdOF53B6dm0hRKYyXXsOzuiG4_X7RfLJcyXkUQN1zK"> According to the composition of this Epistle, although it seems that James did not have a clear vision concerning God’s New Testament economy, he had the wisdom to portray things concerning the practical Christian life. </p>
<p data-content-id="uphS182OKDP7uqx2UEGnKtw26PfVEiZGV7FMGxy8XHg5GYmRM3XGoYXCl-E69ihAh"> James was reputed to be a man of prayer. Here he charged those who received his Epistle to pray for wisdom. This implies that his own wisdom was given by God through prayer. In this Epistle James emphasizes prayer (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99399" data-verses="James 5:14-18">5:14-18</span>). Prayer is a virtue of practical Christian perfection. </p>
<p data-content-id="fXmheRHcyZcCa98HUv8q0jhzC50kJ2jhdGIrjFl-viEyINrPmG0-ZFVt0I7h1x-dS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99400" data-verses="James 1:5">verse 5</span> James tells us that if we lack wisdom, we should ask God for it. In order to be perfect in our behavior, the basic need is for wisdom. A foolish person cannot be perfect. But if we are full of wisdom, then in every activity of our daily life we shall behave perfectly. This indicates that perfection is mainly carried out through wisdom. A wise person can be perfect. However, if we lack wisdom, we may offend others by our foolish talk. Our speaking may indicate that we do not have adequate wisdom. When we are short of wisdom, we should ask God for it. </p>
<p data-content-id="IhVkL5UA-Ai1UijWBYj0vguhfnGJDU-L1DOjYbPobA6Mn6GD-tboE0USWnkJTJXpw"> James says that if we ask God for wisdom, He will give generously and will not reproach. To give generously is to give with simplicity and liberality, without reserve (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99401" data-verses="Romans 12:8">Rom. 12:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99402" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:2">2 Cor. 8:2</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="H4mDMgr9QwAR4L0KmVGdb2V_bi1NzVHL8-wSuiWy2LLYbGIotF5E8ZpL7mlM2RwvU"> James’ word here indicates that he is godly and that he knows God. In this verse James did not say, “If you lack wisdom, you should learn of me. Let me give you some lectures or some books to read. Then you will have wisdom.” Instead of speaking this way, James, being godly, encourages the readers of his Epistle to ask of God. He knows God and in particular knows that God is generous. James tells us in this verse that when God gives, He does not reproach. But a stingy person does not want to give anything. If he does give something, he may give with reproach, with stinging words. The generous <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> God is not like such a man. God gives generously, and He gives without reproach. Being a godly man, a man who knew God, James realized this. </p>

Someone who wavers in prayer is like a surge of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed. </p>

He is a double-souled man, unstable in all his ways.” God made man only one soul, with one mind and one will. When a believer doubts in prayer, he makes himself double-souled, like a boat with two rudders, unstable in direction. Faith in prayer is also a virtue of practical Christian perfection. </p>

When a lowly brother glories and rejoices in exaltation, it leads him spontaneously to praise the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99408" data-verses="James 5:13">5:13</span>). He should not glory in a secular way without praising the Lord. But although it is easy for a lowly brother to glory, rejoice, and praise the Lord in his exaltation, in his elevation or uplifted estate, it is not easy for a rich one to do so in being brought low. Nevertheless, whether in exaltation or in being brought low, to rejoice and praise is a virtue of practical Christian perfection. <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> </p>

A person may be rich today, but after a short period of time he may be poor. For example, a brother may have a high position at work, and suddenly and unexpectedly he may be demoted or even fired. Because such things happen, we should not put our trust in our environment, wealth, position, or education. </p>

But there is the possibility that we may be careless in our behavior or that we may neglect the matter of practical Christian perfection. Therefore, we need the balance provided by the book of James. </p>
<p data-content-id="rfusliGbPdPcLZprJ1akH19uwKvJw_oqopc2-THiJE807T_kQ_P6OyW_KpX_-6kRP"> Luther said that the Epistle of James was an epistle of straw. In saying this, Luther was both unfair and wrong. We need to realize that after the revelation in Paul’s writings concerning God’s economy, God put in the book of James, one of the seven books of the New Testament that was not fully recognized until the council of Carthage in A.D. 397. Prior to that time, there was uncertainty whether this Epistle should be considered part of the holy Word. Eventually, the book of James was recognized as part of the Scriptures. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="d1fuyiETGtKIPQqDyWeq53qBe1f6Ilpp8bXi5N7k-nj2E8NGbTudSSN6nSv1VEnIj">A Balancing Word</h2><p data-content-id="3VbgTLVrrvAdrpIaipPsz5FHbXAo0ZkHuqEjIs-pHsytNTNsxbIK1NHVOl5cz1kdL"> A striking characteristic of the Epistle of James is that it indicates that we may be very strong in God’s economy, yet may not be complete and entire in our Christian behavior in our personal daily life. Many of us can testify that we have seen the vision concerning God’s economy and that we are absolutely for this vision. However, we still need to pay attention to our behavior in our daily life. A brother may easily become angry with his wife, or a sister may not have <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> the proper attitude toward her husband. In such a case, both the brother and the sister are neither complete nor entire. This is an illustration of the fact that we need the balancing word found in the book of James. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="G8SAEs1Krd9S2jsfJlLj5PXzhTUMyGRHQ-1CtevHSxneBk0PBM-TI8WsV9IgWOY4X">A Strong Warning</h2><p data-content-id="ctFQYC6UrqiZbn8l9ZT5ZDdlakEYxuASqryW0p9-WDbi2mDEdlC57zXU4Te-jvXCm"> In addition to providing balance, the Epistle of James also serves as a strong warning that it is possible to be very godly and yet not be clear concerning the vision of God’s New Testament economy. According to church history, James was noted for living a godly life. One account says that James spent so much time kneeling in prayer that his knees became calloused. James certainly was a godly man, a man of prayer, and prayer is emphasized in his Epistle. Nevertheless, James may not have had a clear view concerning the distinction between grace and law; that is, he may not have had a clear view regarding God’s economy. In his writings there are hints that this was the situation. However, his Epistle is notable and remarkable concerning Christian conduct and emphasizes practical Christian perfection. For this reason, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99442" data-verses="James 1:4">1:4</span> James indicates that the believers should be “complete and entire, lacking in nothing.” </p>
<p data-content-id="YGhoMmNbfDp0bWKM5hwrbwEOK9BDqxeUmBqmzniy71FQtNkmC5DbjEuj6ntsBIPxv"> It is only fair to point out that in the book of James we have both a balance and a warning. We need this book. Otherwise, there would be a gap, a lack, in the holy Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="ElMrEAlP8ftT0YOzkn-IDx8byesFUrUWVk2jaIcn3gBsLxmLn-lZGxYX8zNGXMIOl"> It is important that we do not have an unbalanced view of the Epistle of James. On the one hand, we need to see that this Epistle indicates that James may have lacked a clear view of God’s economy. On the other hand, this book points out the need for practical Christian perfection. Of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, fourteen were written by Paul. The Epistles of Paul are concerned with God’s economy, God’s dispensation. This economy is vital and crucial. But in order to carry out God’s economy, we need practical Christian perfection. This means that we should not be careless in our daily living. We may use a soldier in the army as an illustration. The main responsibility of a soldier is to fight for his country. But in order to be a good fighter, a soldier needs to be proper in his personal daily life. Likewise, <span class="pg" data-page-id="21" id="21">[21]</span> although we may be soldiers, fighters, for God’s economy, we still need to be complete and entire in our daily Christian life. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="DYpvfwthyMvCF0ygRg2asUwiWxFkQKG87X3toUjpjunZ2pW9fdlKIIWbVXL8-7eXw">The Position of James</h2><p data-content-id="SwctBFggzfUJglQ24tu_xmAADegfC2ynIFcZ-a3lHZphym2Zh-6IKR76NGlGm68fy"> The place of the book of James is indicated by its position in the arrangement of the books of the New Testament: it comes immediately after the fourteen Epistles of Paul. The Epistles of Paul from Romans to Hebrews all cover the major subject of God’s economy. We may liken these Epistles to the main entrance to a building. We then may liken the Epistle of James to a little door near this entrance. Although the “entrance” of Paul’s Epistles is crucial, we still need the “door” of the Epistle of James. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="gpYKPvtdYclKhrJW9O7yrgrDlJcfBVJggz89XvIwZ8elNOMdNNR6T7BAC4HqUxp3H">The Importance of Being Balanced<br/>in Our Christian Life</h2><p data-content-id="eko9UtlmbjVTttTRUCvbQDdH9stCBvVf0RUpz2KYr7MNBTzt0jRkMWR9Tom-GE5ul"> The book of James is a balance to those who are unbalanced in their Christian life. Perhaps in your Christian life you are wholly for God’s economy. However, in your daily personal life you may be very short in the way you speak and handle matters. Concerning a number of things you may lack wisdom. Although you are a good soldier fighting for God’s economy, in your daily life you may not be complete and entire. You may not trust in God very much, and you may not pray to Him concerning your needs. Because you are good in the major things but lacking in certain practical things, you need balance in your Christian life. The first thing the Epistle of James provides us with is this needed balance. </p>
<p data-content-id="5VAeA4mi_BzoP4UTvvHo7AtdYs_WjnjQtw9LkAyEvPthr3EV_kNsknNdn8NKKnb2a"> As we have indicated, the book of James also serves as a warning. James was outstanding in the matter of practical Christian perfection; he was a godly man who knew God, who loved God, and who prayed to God. But James was hindered by his godliness and veiled by his religion from seeing a thorough vision concerning God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="NSePEbfnjgokxvAriozUypVqjILBxBlfLERYtNaYkAdpJWRyGW0cHgE12ZZlXZGuU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99443" data-verses="James 1:27">1:27</span> James speaks of “pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father.” As far as proper human behavior is concerned, we may need to be religious. We may be absolutely for God’s economy, and yet we may be wrong in the way we speak to others or deal with them. Suppose a brother says, <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> “Don’t you know that I am utterly for God’s economy? I have sacrificed everything for this. Day by day, I give my future to the Lord for His economy. Don’t you appreciate this?” Yes, such a brother may be for God’s economy, but he still needs practical Christian perfection in his daily life. Once again we see that we need to be balanced: we need a clear vision concerning God’s economy, and we need practical Christian perfection. </p>
<p data-content-id="t0d1t2V0HH1NR-t9vSmpl_FMCT5YyoyheBAEOg9m-xpl2nZ_fvHabIskpbQUaxpFx"> We should be warned from the Epistle of James that we may be very godly, yet still lack a clear view concerning God’s economy. Someone may be godly, humble, and meek in his daily life. But he may not be able to fight for God’s economy. In order to fight for God’s economy, we must learn the proper strategy. Paul was a person who was balanced. On the one hand, he was an excellent fighter; on the other hand, he was a godly person. Paul even encouraged Timothy, his younger co-worker, to exercise himself unto godliness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99444" data-verses="1Timothy 4:7">1 Tim. 4:7</span>). In paying attention to the major things of God’s economy, we should not neglect the practical details of our personal daily life. </p>
<p data-content-id="h0oyZ4RHIegww8ONrZEVEcnVsqChQB9YLcis0lJvDP2oHMeV-6S-r3mp_M9SBC9aV"> The vast majority of today’s Christians pay more attention to minor matters in their daily life than they do to the major matters of God’s New Testament economy. In fact, many seeking Christians take care of very few of the things that are truly major. These Christians may be religious and godly, they may pray a great deal, they may have faith and endurance, and they may love God. In their Christian life they are imitators of James. But they have not seen God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="UZYZTt6u-1IBs1qS0NSMYmh979YyagBJtVcgdknThiQnYlKAX3Sy-4UcWtwgFSadE"> Because it is possible for us to be this kind of Christian, we need the warning that we may be godly and yet not see God’s economy. We may be complete and entire concerning Christian conduct, but we may not know how to fight the battle to carry out God’s economy. Therefore, I am burdened to emphasize the importance of being balanced in our Christian life. We need to see God’s economy, and we need to be perfected in our daily personal life so that we may be complete and entire. We need both the balance and the warning found in the book of James. Regarding this book, we need to <span class="pg" data-page-id="23" id="23">[23]</span> be fair, recognizing that the “entrance” of Paul’s Epistles still needs the help of the “door” of the book of James. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99479" data-verses="James 1:19">verse 19</span> James says, “You know this, my beloved brothers; but let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.” The Greek words rendered “you know this” may also be translated “know this.” Hearing tempts us to speak, and speaking is the fire that kindles wrath (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99480" data-verses="James 3:6">3:6</span>). If we bridle our speaking (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99481" data-verses="James 1:26">1:26</span>), we quench our wrath. James’ word here, for the strengthening of his view of practical Christian perfection, resembles the tone of the Old Testament proverbs (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99482" data-verses="Proverbs 10:19">Prov. 10:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99483" data-verses="Proverbs 14:17">14:17</span>). </p>

The wrath of man is useless in performing the righteousness of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="YGhoMmNbfDp0bWKM5hw3byAqK9BDqxeUmBqmzniy71FQtNkmC5DbjEuj6ntsBIPxv">RECEIVING WITH MEEKNESS THE IMPLANTED WORD</h2><p data-content-id="W7WtXlPtgrNZCLCrkmMqw4fdeOktPH64lEPWmyE5BD5VObGt2sMOZIySFfyzkddGt"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99485" data-verses="James 1:21">verse 21</span> James goes on to say, “Wherefore, putting away all filthiness and abundance of malice, receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.” Here the word of God is likened to a plant of life planted into our being and growing in us to bring forth fruit for the salvation of our souls. We need to receive the word of God in meekness, in all submission, without any resistance. </p>
<p data-content-id="2mOVbM5hMqH0CSuhHR_zmA9rdOF53B6dm0hRKYyXXsOzuiG4_X7RfLJcyXkUQN1zK"> According to the context of this chapter, the salvation of our souls implies the endurance of environmental trials (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99486" data-verses="James 1:2-12">vv. 2-12</span>) and the resisting of lustful temptation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99487" data-verses="James 1:13-21">vv. 13-21</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> James’ view concerning the salvation of our souls is somewhat negative, definitely not as positive as that of Paul, who says our soul can be transformed by the renewing Spirit even to the image of the Lord from glory to glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99488" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Rom. 12:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99489" data-verses="Ephesians 4:23">Eph. 4:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99490" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Cor. 3:18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="uphS182OKDP7uqx2UEG_KtA-6PfVEiZGV7FMGxy8XHg5GYmRM3XGoYXCl-E69ihAh"> We should appreciate James for saying that we need to receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save our souls. In his writings Paul did not use the expression “implanted word.” This expression indicates that the word is of life. Here James likens the word to a living plant that is planted into the soil of our heart. In this way, the word becomes the implanted word. After the word of God has been planted into the soil of our heart, it will grow and have the power to save our soul. </p>
<p data-content-id="fXmheRHcyZcCa98HUv8y0jR7C50kJ2jhdGIrjFl-viEyINrPmG0-ZFVt0I7h1x-dS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99491" data-verses="James 1:21">verse 21</span> we are told to receive the implanted word with meekness. In this verse meekness does not mean gentleness; here meekness means submissiveness, without resistance. To receive the word with meekness is not to reject it, but to be submissive to the word. We should receive God’s word implanted into our being with full submissiveness. Whatever God’s word says, we should receive by saying, “Amen.” As the hymn says, we should “Amen the Word of God” (<em>Hymns,</em> #1218). </p>
<p data-content-id="IhVkL5UA-Ai1UijWBYjsvge5fnGJDU-L1DOjYbPobA6Mn6GD-tboE0USWnkJTJXpw"> If we receive the implanted word with meekness, with submissiveness, this means we are absolutely open to God’s word. We are like land that is opened to receive seed from the farmer and rain from the sky. God plants, or sows, His word into our heart, and we should receive His word with meekness. This is to receive in meekness the implanted word. Because this word is living, after it has been implanted into our heart, it will grow. Moreover, as the word grows, it will save our soul. </p>

Furthermore, lust has much to do with the <span class="pg" data-page-id="31" id="31">[31]</span> soul. The saving of the soul involves both the enduring of trials and the resisting of temptations. </p>
<p data-content-id="kjrSvRAcdIYGgsz_Sub_x5TroNxzjoOqmNLWQDF1YmZZNsg4nPtS2foqp9tODma79"> Persecution, trial, and temptation for the most part affect our soul. For example, suppose a brother’s new car is stolen, and he is sad because of this; he is suffering in his soul. Likewise, if a brother loses his job, he will also suffer in his soul. Most sufferings affect the soul. How can we withstand these sufferings? As we have pointed out, the power to withstand suffering is through the divine life that is within us. As God-born ones, we resist temptation also by the divine life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Jc4x4KXCavfkhV6qotLnaWXUy9q8T38eDRXNXg-DYj0P6DN-lP-ystrS-gsnggFxK">NOURISHED THROUGH THE WORD</h2><p data-content-id="zw-QNh3bJjXHUWGoervfwddEUHLHhiQcqVMAqhfCTI8JU9Frqis4EsjolTsxdHVgc"> If we would resist temptation, we need to be nourished through receiving the implanted word. We may use eating food as an illustration. Although we may be physically healthy, we still need to eat nourishing meals every day. Although we have physical life, we still need daily nourishment. If I did not eat breakfast in the morning, I would not have the strength to work. The principle is the same with the divine life. Through regeneration God has imparted His life into us. But this life still requires nourishment, and the nourishment we need is the implanted word. Every day we need to come to the Bible to receive God’s word. In our spiritual life we need a good “breakfast” every day. When we eat our spiritual breakfast, we receive the implanted word. As God plants His word into us every morning, this word becomes nourishment to our inward man, and it strengthens our spirit. Once our spirit has been strengthened, it will sustain our soul. As a result, our soul will have the strength to withstand suffering and to resist temptation. This means that through the nourishment of the implanted word we experience the salvation of our soul. </p>
<p data-content-id="aXWDsCw7hDoNWis49VGV7PS8qsSAlC1fgsToKd4nqaSqp--ppGDRHSPQeGdbYYBN2"> If our soul is not strengthened in this way, it will not be able to withstand trials and temptations. For instance, if a brother is not nourished through the implanted word, his soul will not be able to withstand the loss of a job or of a sum of money. Such a loss will always affect our soul. Satan uses such sufferings to put us down. How, then, can our soul be sustained in the midst of such suffering? Our soul can only be <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> sustained by a spirit that has been nourished through the implanted word. Realizing this, Paul prayed that the saints would be strengthened into the inner man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99493" data-verses="Ephesians 3:16">Eph. 3:16</span>). Our soul needs to be strengthened in the inner man, and the inner man is the spirit. But how can the spirit be strengthened? The spirit is strengthened by being nourished with the implanted word of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="bQia7yaJ-FE89WGzCJPqzkmRm1CNeT4exZMXdix86tnN_PWdvNRjSLRFm0BsMkGpw"> Many of us can testify that our spirit has been strengthened by God’s implanted word. If we spend some time in the morning to take the Word of God into us, our spirit will be strengthened. Because our spirit is strengthened, it will sustain our soul. Then our soul, being sustained in this way, will be able to withstand trials and resist temptations. </p>
<p data-content-id="qHEMv1_QlV3K2aWcpBw1bw8JGmCZLmUxZ6_2zrUtpceAKYao9MrurJnGkKYo22QDn"> We know from experience that if our spirit is not strengthened and our soul is not sustained by a strong spirit, we are easily defeated by trials or temptations. The result is failure. This means that although we have been saved in our spirit, we are not being saved daily in our soul. Rather, day by day there is a loss to our soul; we even lose our soul. Do you know why we lose our soul? We lose our soul because it does not receive sustenance from our spirit. If our spirit is “flat,” lacking heavenly air, it will not be able to sustain our soul. Hence, we need the implanted word to “pump up” our spirit. If our spirit is filled with divine air, it will be strong and able to sustain our soul. As a result, our soul will be saved. </p>
<p data-content-id="yv7JIgy5E5UniKhBpIWWqVBPgTpyax1XzsMXiIaGaTDp7hbyHiYKUzjvYMoBjZGqP"> Day by day we need to receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save our soul. The implanted word is full of energy to save our soul. This word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99494" data-verses="James 1:21">1:21</span> certainly is an excellent point in James’ writing. </p>
<p data-content-id="8AlrVo_CLrTEK6_Dj7qIZPAyF6mOaFZcB2eUD5nDRPaTPEwHuxOeahUY5IgbZDkrV"> Every day our soul is tested by outward environmental sufferings and by inward enticing lusts. For this reason, our soul needs to be saved. As we have pointed out, in order for our soul to be saved, it needs to be sustained through our daily feeding on the implanted word. This requires that we receive the word of God just as we receive our daily food. If a child refuses to eat, he will become weak and unhealthy. If a child refuses to eat nourishing food, he is not submissive or meek in the matter of eating. Every child needs to receive in meekness the food served by his mother. If he eats healthy <span class="pg" data-page-id="33" id="33">[33]</span> food in this way, he will be strong and healthy. In like manner, we need to receive in meekness the implanted word. </p>

Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this, to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, to keep oneself unspotted from the world.” These verses, in which James speaks of religion, indicate that James’ writing concerning God’s New Testament economy is not as striking as that of Paul, Peter, or John. Paul focuses on Christ living and being formed in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99553" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99554" data-verses="Galatians 4:19">4:19</span>) and Christ being magnified in us and lived out of us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99555" data-verses="Philippians 1:20-21">Phil. 1:20-21</span>), that we as the church, His Body, may become His fullness, His expression (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99556" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22-23">Eph. 1:22-23</span>). Peter stresses the fact that God has regenerated us through the resurrection of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99557" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>), making us partakers of His divine nature, so that we may live a life of godliness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99558" data-verses="2Peter 1:3-7">2 Pet. 1:3-7</span>) and be built up a spiritual house to express His virtues (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99559" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">1 Pet. 2:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99560" data-verses="1Peter 2:9">9</span>). John emphasizes the <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> eternal life given to us for our fellowship with the Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99561" data-verses="1John 1:2-3">1 John 1:2-3</span>), and the divine birth that brings into us the divine life as the divine seed for us to live a life like God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99562" data-verses="1John 2:29">1 John 2:29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99563" data-verses="1John 3:9">3:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99564" data-verses="1John 4:17">4:17</span>) and be the church, as a lampstand, bearing the testimony of Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99565" data-verses="Revelation 1:9">Rev. 1:9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99566" data-verses="Revelation 1:11-12">11-12</span>), which will consummate in the New Jerusalem to express God for eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99567" data-verses="Revelation 21:2-3">Rev. 21:2-3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99568" data-verses="Revelation 21:10-11">10-11</span>). I hope that all the saints, especially the young people, will study this summary of the writings of Paul, Peter, and John regarding God’s New Testament economy and thoroughly get into each point. </p>
<p data-content-id="UZYZTt6u-1IBs1qS0NSUYkVZ79YyagBJtVcgdknThiQnYlKAX3Sy-4UcWtwgFSadE"> What does James say in his Epistle concerning God’s New Testament economy? James emphasizes, as New Testament characteristics, only God’s begetting of us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99569" data-verses="James 1:18">1:18</span>), the perfect law of freedom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99570" data-verses="James 1:25">1:25</span>), the indwelling Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99571" data-verses="James 4:5">4:5</span>), and a little regarding the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99572" data-verses="James 5:14">5:14</span>). However, he mentions these things without speaking of Christ as our life and the church as the expression of Christ, the two most outstanding and dispensational characteristics of the New Testament. To point out these matters concerning the Epistle of James is to have a fair and balanced view. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="eko9UtlmbjVTttTRUCvDQDdn9stCBvVf0RUpz2KYr7MNBTzt0jRkMWR9Tom-GE5ul">PURE RELIGION</h2><p data-content-id="5VAeA4mi_BzoP4UTvvHw7At9Ys_WjnjQtw9LkAyEvPthr3EV_kNsknNdn8NKKnb2a"> According to his Epistle, James must have been very religious. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99573" data-verses="James 1:27">1:27</span> he uses the word “religion” in a positive sense when he speaks concerning “pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father.” James goes on to say that this pure religion is to visit orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unspotted from the world. To visit orphans and widows in their affliction is to act according to the loving heart of God, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world is to behave according to the holy nature of God. No doubt, this is a very good religion, even the best religion, a religion according to the heart and nature of God. Nevertheless, although James could write such a word about pure religion, he did not have a clear vision concerning God’s New Testament economy. This is a matter that needs to be emphasized again and again. <span class="pg" data-page-id="41" id="41">[41]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NSePEbfnjgokxvAriozMyplijILBxBlfLERYtNaYkAdpJWRyGW0cHgE12ZZlXZGuU">THE NEED FOR<br/>BALANCE IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="t0d1t2V0HH1NR-t9vSmxl_1ECT5YyoyheBAEOg9m-xpl2nZ_fvHabIskpbQUaxpFx"> In our Christian life we need to have a balance between practical Christian perfection and God’s New Testament economy. The fact that the human body has two shoulders, two arms, two hands, two legs, and two feet indicates that there is balance in God’s creation. We should not be unbalanced Christians. We need to be balanced with God’s economy and our practical Christian perfection. In what I have written concerning the Epistle of James I have endeavored to be balanced, pointing out, on the positive side, that in the Epistle of James we have practical Christian perfection and, on the negative side, a warning that a godly person may not have a clear vision of God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="h0oyZ4RHIegww8ONrZENEcXNsqChQB9YLcis0lJvDP2oHMeV-6S-r3mp_M9SBC9aV"> It may have been due to James’ religion and his practical Christian perfection that he was reputed along with Peter and John to be a pillar, even the first, in the church at Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99574" data-verses="Galatians 2:9">Gal. 2:9</span>). However, he was not strong in the revelation of God’s New Testament economy in Christ. Rather, he was still under the influence of the background of the old Judaic religion—to worship God with ceremonies and live a life in the fear of God. This is proved by what he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99575" data-verses="James 2:2-11">2:2-11</span> and by his words in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99576" data-verses="Acts 21:20-24">Acts 21:20-24</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UZYZTt6u-1IBs1qS0NSUYmRl79YyagBJtVcgdknThiQnYlKAX3Sy-4UcWtwgFSadE">THE SITUATION IN<br/>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE OF ACTS</h2><p data-content-id="M5k0MSEHgd3kpvHyxth1pjfUFeYIEoEbYdxgZ7SbLZ9AgZo8AtxdxyUeNVdBxvC2t"> Let us now consider the situation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99577" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99578" data-verses="Acts 21:18">Verse 18</span> says, “And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.” After Paul had greeted them, “he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99579" data-verses="Acts 21:19">v. 19</span>). When they heard this report, “they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law.” The Greek word rendered “thousands” actually means myriads, tens of thousands. This verse indicates that James, who took the lead to tell Paul about the thousands of Jews who believed and yet were zealous of the law, believed in the Lord Jesus, but he still preached and <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> taught the law of Moses. Although he had been saved through grace, he still kept the law. What do we have here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99580" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span>—the dispensation of law or the dispensation of grace? In this chapter we have a mixture. God would not tolerate this mixture of the dispensation of law with the dispensation of grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="VjSPHAkiRuUMjgdoIgvJpUuEqNVAC8G64A83SwbKdRbNrGnfJFePyFZ-sNKhuW-O6"> In weighing James we need to use a heavenly scale, a scale that has James’ writings concerning practical Christian perfection on one side and his word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99581" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span> on the other side. Only when we have both sides can we have a balanced view of James. For example, if we had only <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99582" data-verses="James 1:1">chapter one</span> of James but not <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99583" data-verses="Acts 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span> of Acts, our estimation of James might be too high. But if we also have <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99584" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span>, our view will be more balanced. </p>
<p data-content-id="iCOojXOyxqA-I1jMT0geL6QAWVTlHunjJ3KKahF8eEJoQMRJhwth8ID_92Ux8Ncvj"> I have consulted some good books on the Epistle of James. But in the comments on James, none of these books refers to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99585" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span>. Therefore, I wish to emphasize the fact that if we would have a balanced view of James, we need to consider his Epistle against the background of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99586" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span>. When we read this chapter, we can understand why James addressed his Epistle to the twelve tribes and also why in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99587" data-verses="James 2:1">chapter two</span> he uses the term “synagogue.” The fact that James speaks of the twelve tribes and the synagogue indicates that he had mixed the things of Judaism with the matters of the Christian life according to God’s New Testament economy. James’ own word points to such a mixture. </p>
<p data-content-id="1KTwyQK4tHZ9rxJcEPdoVFc0k6rwZ7l0zNaOpQTEbh3mXt5ffmH8FCboj1fmIOmnW"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99588" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span> James advised, even urged, Paul to go to the temple with those who had a vow on them: “Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them; them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99589" data-verses="Acts 21:23-24">vv. 23-24</span>). By that time Paul had already written the books of Romans and Galatians, books in which he says that the law had been annulled. Nevertheless, he acted according to James’ suggestion. </p>

Here James tells us not to have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect of persons. This certainly is a virtue of Christian perfection. If we have the faith of the glorious Lord, we should not have respect of persons. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="RBya5z1w6HjqYZwY36zWeiVFdZeLJUEivbrUBYBEL86ebNlv-i0JxmyfhCgxDBChp">THE RICH AND THE POOR IN THE SYNAGOGUE</h2><p data-content-id="Jc4x4KXCavfkhV6qotLvaWX0y9q8T38eDRXNXg-DYj0P6DN-lP-ystrS-gsnggFxK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99599" data-verses="James 2:2">verse 2</span> James continues, “And if there comes into your synagogue a man with gold rings in splendid clothing, and there also comes in a poor man in filthy clothing.” Here “synagogue” is the anglicized form of the Greek word <em>sunagoge,</em> composed of <em>sun,</em> together, and <em>ago,</em> to bring; hence, a collecting, gathering, congregation, assembly; by transition, the place of gathering. It was used in the New Testament to denote the congregation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99600" data-verses="Acts 13:43">Acts 13:43</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99601" data-verses="Acts 9:2">9:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99602" data-verses="Luke 12:11">Luke 12:11</span>) and the congregating place (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99603" data-verses="Luke 7:5">Luke 7:5</span>) of the Jews, where they sought the knowledge of God by studying the Holy Scriptures (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99604" data-verses="Luke 4:16-17">Luke 4:16-17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99605" data-verses="Acts 13:14-15">Acts 13:14-15</span>). In Jerusalem there were quite a few synagogues of various kinds of Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99606" data-verses="Acts 6:9">Acts 6:9</span>). This word, used here by James, may indicate that the Jewish believers considered their assembly and assembling place as also one of <span class="pg" data-page-id="48" id="48">[48]</span> the synagogues among the Jews. If so, this bears, as the whole Epistle does, a Jewish character, and may indicate that the Jewish Christians regarded themselves as still a part of the Jewish nation, as the chosen people of God according to the Old Testament, and that they lacked a clear vision concerning the distinction between God’s chosen people of the Old Testament and the believers in Christ of the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="zw-QNh3bJjXHUWGoervXwddkUHLHhiQcqVMAqhfCTI8JU9Frqis4EsjolTsxdHVgc"> We see once again that although James was a very godly man, he did not have a clear vision concerning God’s New Testament economy. I am concerned that in the years to come certain saints may think that it is good enough to be like James, godly and perfect in character and behavior. As we have pointed out, we need to be balanced in our Christian life; that is, we need to care for God’s New Testament economy and also have in our daily living the necessary practical Christian perfection. We have seen from this Epistle that, on the one hand, James indicates that we need practical Christian perfection and that, on the other hand, this Epistle serves as a warning that even a godly man may not have a clear vision of God’s economy. This was the reason in the foregoing message we considered James’ word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99607" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span>. The mixture in Jerusalem between the old and new dispensations was a cause for God’s allowing the Roman army to destroy the city. Nothing is more offensive to God than opposing His economy. Of course, if we have poor character, that will be offensive to Him. But poor character is not as serious a matter as being opposed to God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="aXWDsCw7hDoNWis49VGd7Pi0qsSAlC1fgsToKd4nqaSqp--ppGDRHSPQeGdbYYBN2"> Concerning a rich man and a poor man who may come into the synagogue, James asked the recipients of his Epistle, “And you look upon the one wearing the splendid clothing and say, You sit here in a good place; and to the poor man you say, You stand there, or sit under my footstool; have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil reasonings?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99608" data-verses="James 2:3-4">vv. 3-4</span>). Any distinctions that existed between the rich and the poor among the Christian brothers were a shame to the Lord and to the salvation of His divine life. </p>

<p data-content-id="8AlrVo_CLrTEK6_Dj7qAZPw6F6mOaFZcB2eUD5nDRPaTPEwHuxOeahUY5IgbZDkrV"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99616" data-verses="James 2:5">verse 5</span> James speaks the second time about loving God (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99617" data-verses="James 1:12">1:12</span>). We believe in the Lord for our salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99618" data-verses="Acts 16:31">Acts 16:31</span>); we love God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99619" data-verses="1John 2:5">1 John 2:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99620" data-verses="1John 2:15">15</span>) for our overcoming so that we may receive the promised kingdom as a reward. </p>
<p data-content-id="0m4z7WjaQSszGQbFUoSB_hhggm_CJjCl1isgWe7WUIcWTz8MItSGLw_UyXo-zA-S2"> We cannot receive the kingdom simply by believing. According to the Gospel of Matthew, the kingdom will be a reward. Receiving this reward requires that we love God. In order to receive salvation, it is adequate that we believe in the Lord. But if we would receive the reward of the kingdom, we need to love God. </p>
<p data-content-id="7BRJEZD5gkWtHTSTJ-xgrqPIpNzBAd1_8iopN4prHuN_80zcw6hfQznB3G6mac_0M"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99621" data-verses="James 2:2">2:2</span> James speaks about the synagogue, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99622" data-verses="James 2:5">2:5</span>, about the kingdom. This indicates that he puts these two matters together. What a serious mistake! This is a further indication that James was lacking with respect to God’s economy. It is not possible to practice the reality of the kingdom in a Jewish synagogue. This can be practiced only in the church life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_jAGz6lO6aQbYP8SEIUcbdYuZU-fMVsgR8eZyvghebuCayzBaptVemk7u2CVoPIrs">OPPRESSED BY THE RICH</h2><p data-content-id="BmVADu9gULAMo66zcQUs5LOzNrEQgPquy00J0Vwt0yqyoSvW0w3G4DK1sN-5-k4Ln"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99623" data-verses="James 2:6-7">verses 6 and 7</span> James says, “But you have dishonored the poor. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you to the courts? Do they not blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?” The Greek word rendered “courts” may also be translated “tribunals.” James’ word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99624" data-verses="James 2:6">verse 6</span> is also a mixture. I do not believe that the rich brothers in Christ dragged <span class="pg" data-page-id="50" id="50">[50]</span> the poor brothers to the law courts. Rather, I believe that James is referring here to wealthy, unbelieving Jews, who took certain brothers to court. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99625" data-verses="James 2:7">verse 7</span>, these rich ones blasphemed the honorable name by which the believers are called. Literally, “by which you are called” is “which is called upon you.” Here James indicates that it is a rich unbeliever who blasphemes the name of the Lord. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xXIrLbnXUZGQ4NDXb9jtEuOSDIs_bxXo3yZ-o_5a7EYt6Oc01hRA0bcp8yrK4ouHa">THE ROYAL LAW</h2><p data-content-id="rfusliGbPdPcLZprJ1awH3ZOwKvJw_oqopc2-THiJE807T_kQ_P6OyW_KpX_-6kRP"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99626" data-verses="James 2:8">Verse 8</span> says, “If indeed you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well.” The royal law refers to the commandment, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” This is the king of all laws, and covers and fulfills all laws (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99627" data-verses="Galatians 5:14">Gal. 5:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99628" data-verses="Romans 13:8-10">Rom. 13:8-10</span>). Loving God and loving our neighbor are the greatest requirements of the law. All the law hangs on these (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99629" data-verses="Matthew 22:36-40">Matt. 22:36-40</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="d1fuyiETGtKIPQqDyWe-51ele1f6Ilpp8bXi5N7k-nj2E8NGbTudSSN6nSv1VEnIj"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99630" data-verses="James 2:9">verse 9</span> James says, “But if you respect persons, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.” This indicates that to respect persons is contrary to the law, and anything contrary to the law is sin. Having respect of persons is against the royal law, the commandment to love our neighbor as ourself. To say to a poor man, “You stand here, or sit under my footstool,” is not to love. We would not like to be treated in this way. The point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99631" data-verses="James 2:9">verse 9</span> is that those who respect persons commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. </p>
<p data-content-id="QBdOzvBqJM8eOv6hegi95ZS8CtWMiLVUvV2Nnr0lMzIJhRS15tRZz8UblyD9gnxI-"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99632" data-verses="James 2:10">verse 10</span> James goes on to say, “For whoever keeps the whole law, yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.” The word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99633" data-verses="James 2:8-11">verses 8 through 11</span> indicates that the Jewish believers at James’ time were still practicing the keeping of the Old Testament law. This corresponds to the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99634" data-verses="Acts 21:20">Acts 21:20</span> spoken by James and the elders in Jerusalem to Paul. James, the elders in Jerusalem, and many thousands of Jewish believers still remained in a mixture of the Christian faith and the Mosaic law. They even advised Paul to practice such a semi-Judaic mixture (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99635" data-verses="Acts 21:17-26">Acts 21:17-26</span>). They were unaware that the dispensation of law was altogether over and that the dispensation of grace should be <span class="pg" data-page-id="51" id="51">[51]</span> fully honored, and that any disregard of the distinction between these two dispensations would be against God’s dispensational administration and would be a great damage to God’s economical plan for the building up of the church as the expression of Christ. Thus, James’ Epistle was written under the cloud of a semi-Judaic mixture, under a background that made matters obscure. </p>

To cut straight the word of the truth means to unfold the Word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion. Throughout the centuries many teachers have tried to cut straight, or rightly divide, the holy Word. However, many Bible teachers were not able to do this very well. </p>
<p data-content-id="CycrTQag9k0ZJC-sxiHaq_DAgAmQ-JOvBxQVM-M8gJmFFFBznh2LiK2lnzzJSuqrk"> At the time of the Reformation, Luther took the lead to rightly divide the holy Word. He saw that justification by faith should be divided from works. Although Luther could divide the Word in the way of certain principles, or in the way of a sketch, he did not have the ability to divide the Word in details. We may say that he knew the main roads of the Word, but not the streets and lanes. </p>
<p data-content-id="PqI5bcRSCMX2VJnk3PdYV3qHTxfCVjHYfSB33BKcR23qaKrC0PH--2ZbdKvG0NLNz"> In the eighteenth century Zinzendorf was raised up by the Lord, and to some extent he improved the dividing of the holy Word. In the nineteenth century the British brothers under the leadership of John Nelson Darby were raised up, and they were much more able to divide the Word properly. Much of today’s fundamental theology follows the line of the theology of the British brothers. In this century we were raised up by the Lord by His sovereignty and mercy. Standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before us, we are now able to divide the holy Word not merely according to the main roads, but also according to the streets, lanes, and alleys. </p>
<p data-content-id="-2VHxF_AgLgVwx9u2orBQZz4DlycWFxva7OZG9tT2zdkWTzUkomslY_VVBU07m3zk"> We have pointed out that Luther called the Epistle of James an “epistle of straw.” Luther said this mainly because of what is written in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99688" data-verses="James 2:1">chapter two</span> of the book of James. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="60" id="60">[60]</span> word of Luther indicates that he did not understand this chapter properly and that he was not able to divide the Word in a detailed way. He did not realize that the word “save” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99689" data-verses="James 2:14">2:14</span> has nothing to do with eternal salvation. This verse says, “What is the profit, my brothers, if anyone says he has faith, but does not have works? Can that faith save him?” Some have wrongly used this verse to teach that salvation is not only by faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="iCOojXOyxqA-I1jMT0gWL6QgWVTlHunjJ3KKahF8eEJoQMRJhwth8ID_92Ux8Ncvj"> The word “save” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99690" data-verses="James 2:14">verse 14</span> is related to the judgment spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99691" data-verses="James 2:13">verse 13</span>: “For the judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.” According to the context, in this chapter to be saved is to be saved from judgment without mercy. The judgment mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99692" data-verses="James 2:13">verse 13</span> is not the judgment at the white throne. That judgment determines whether people will be saved or perish. The judgment in this verse is the judgment by Christ at His judgment seat in the air at the time of His coming back. After all the saints have been raptured, they will appear before the judgment seat of Christ. The matter of eternal salvation will have been settled already. However, the Lord will still judge the saints according to the law of freedom, that is, according to the entire New Testament, not according to the law of Moses. This judgment will not determine our eternal salvation; rather, it will determine whether we shall be rewarded or be judged without mercy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1KTwyQK4tHZ9rxJcEPdgVFcUk6rwZ7l0zNaOpQTEbh3mXt5ffmH8FCboj1fmIOmnW">WORKS OF MERCY AND LOVE</h2><p data-content-id="99BuAZ8jJtyNc0LCPMJOsp0X3R7V_QFXtT-pcKhwRfWxiKQ2M3Aeu5ykQnK8Ndlsz"> In order to be saved from judgment without mercy, we need to have the works of mercy and love. These works testify that our faith issues in being saved not only from perdition, but also from judgment without mercy at the judgment seat of Christ. Those who do not have the works of mercy and love will suffer judgment without mercy. This means that they will be disciplined as a result of judgment at the judgment seat of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="jAg8aG9aP0-tG1UwqG80kO1khWr2eb8eEXW94YOstk32l-sMgwfMau9lQc54C1is1"> Many of the past teachers of the Scriptures have not seen the “lane” in these verses. They saw only certain main streets. By the Lord’s mercy and through the help we have received from those who have gone before us, we can see the proper <span class="pg" data-page-id="61" id="61">[61]</span> way to divide the Word here. In this chapter we have a certain lane. Because we are able to divide this portion of the Word properly, we can see that salvation here is not salvation from perdition; instead, it is salvation from unmerciful judgment at the judgment seat of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="TPbSm9yJ3rRwyvrez05fbjR6kfVs4kW1qhdYl1eP-0GOCiFs_osAKvx9pORTanX1Y"> According to this chapter, to despise a poor brother is to murder him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99693" data-verses="James 2:3">2:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99694" data-verses="James 2:11">11</span>). This is to fail to have mercy on the brother. If we do not show mercy to a poor brother, when the Lord comes back He will exercise unmerciful judgment upon us, and we shall suffer as a result. If we would be saved from such unmerciful judgment, we need to have works of mercy and love toward the brothers. These works toward the poor brothers will testify that our faith is living, even issuing in our being saved from unmerciful judgment at the judgment seat of Christ. This is the proper understanding of these verses, the understanding that comes from rightly dividing the Word in a detailed way. </p>
<p data-content-id="n7dJkkKWDa-cR2INo3IxnlJCrFvgS2JQ6tN9l2G97X0fdPtNaqc2g74V2__VxhAkK"> Through the centuries there have been different opinions concerning the Epistle of James. Whereas Luther said that this book is an Epistle of straw, a number of pious and godly people have sided with James. The Brethren, especially Darby, wrote about James from the standpoint of dispensation. Darby pointed out strongly that this Epistle has a Jewish character. However, not even Darby saw the real position and intrinsic contents of this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="6-DOGQYndO4Ie5_pwP2A1cAPIkYGGSmV2lepx9kxJSBKtVfImOmXImZqWVcUQowM6"> A number of years ago we interpreted the Epistle of James in such a way as to reconcile justification by faith with justification by works. Now we see that, under the light we have today, that interpretation was not accurate. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99695" data-verses="James 2:1">chapter two</span> James speaks of being saved by works. In the past we interpreted this to mean that justification by faith is something inward and that justification by works is outward. Justification by faith is the seed inwardly, and justification by works is the fruit produced outwardly. This interpretation is rather general, and the application is not accurate. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99696" data-verses="James 2:1">chapter two</span> of James, to be saved by works is related to the salvation of our soul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99697" data-verses="James 1:21">1:21</span>). This is not a matter of eternal salvation from perdition; it is a matter of the salvation of our soul from unmerciful judgment at Christ’s judgment seat. <span class="pg" data-page-id="62" id="62">[62]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="RBya5z1w6HjqYZwY36zSegRxdZeLJUEivbrUBYBEL86ebNlv-i0JxmyfhCgxDBChp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99698" data-verses="James 2:9-10">2:9 and 10</span> James says, “But if you respect persons, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors. For whoever keeps the whole law, yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.” To respect persons is to look down on a poor brother and to uplift a rich brother. According to what James says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99699" data-verses="James 2:11">2:11</span>, to look down upon a poor brother is to commit murder. </p>
<p data-content-id="sgaJhVd0CHmZbDx-GmtZV7HF3XGxfCmdQQwTN1779ExoH8fF4Gs-v_8h3eWfzUvw6"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99700" data-verses="James 2:12">verse 12</span> James goes on to say, “So speak and so do as those who are about to be judged by a law of freedom.” This judgment will not be that at the white throne, for the judgment at the white throne will be the judgment of unbelievers. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99701" data-verses="James 2:12">verse 12</span> James writes concerning the judgment of believers at the judgment seat of Christ. We need to be clear that this judgment is not for eternal salvation or eternal perdition; on the contrary, this judgment concerns reward or punishment. Furthermore, the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ will not be according to the Mosaic law, but will be according to the law of freedom, that is, according to the New Testament. The Mosaic law will be used for the judgment at the white throne, but the law of freedom will be the basis for the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="wYSIhyq_rpfIziGhUy2CM0PmmbdTIqcSm9oPTJyiFlWgr2WnPxu5jmwezQdUTBEhQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99702" data-verses="James 2:13">verse 13</span> James says that judgment will be without mercy to him who has shown no mercy, and that mercy triumphs over judgment. If we look down on a poor brother, we do not show mercy toward him. If we do not have mercy on a brother today, when we stand before the judgment seat of Christ, Christ will not have mercy toward us. </p>
<p data-content-id="LS6kRlvGM2hNFluLNN_us6jPw0yLpAwCGGM_uBa2MItwvgqfcwY8YiMwZG_FGi4YI"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99703" data-verses="James 2:13">verse 13</span> James tells us that mercy triumphs over judgment. Mercy is the first step that leads to love. If we do not have mercy, we will not have love. We need to realize that before Christ we are extremely poor. If we have mercy toward the poor ones today, then at the time of the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ, Christ will have mercy on us. This is what it means for mercy to triumph over judgment. </p>

For example, you may find that you are not able to keep yourself from speaking even for an hour. But if we fail to bridle our tongue, we are foolish. However, if we restrict our tongue, we are wise.

<p data-content-id="rfusliGbPdPcLZprJ1aIH3pWwKvJw_oqopc2-THiJE807T_kQ_P6OyW_KpX_-6kRP"> According to my experience in human life, I can testify that the best way to avoid trouble is to restrict our tongue. Regarding the proper use of our tongue, we need to ask God for wisdom. The wisdom James speaks of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99739" data-verses="James 3:1">chapter three</span> is a continuation of that mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99740" data-verses="James 1:1">chapter one</span>. We need wisdom to know how to use our tongue. </p>
<p data-content-id="d1fuyiETGtKIPQqDyWeG51u9e1f6Ilpp8bXi5N7k-nj2E8NGbTudSSN6nSv1VEnIj"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99741" data-verses="James 1:19">1:19</span> James says, “Let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.” Speaking often stirs up wrath. But if we restrict our tongue, we shall also limit our anger. For example, suppose you are somewhat unhappy with a certain person, and you point out to him something he has done wrong. Simply by speaking to him in this way you may strike a “match” that is able to start a great “fire.” But if you would restrain yourself from speaking to him concerning that matter, his wrath would not be stirred up. Therefore, in his wisdom James tells us to be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath. </p>
<p data-content-id="QBdOzvBqJM8eOv6hegiF5Zi0CtWMiLVUvV2Nnr0lMzIJhRS15tRZz8UblyD9gnxI-"> Married brothers need to practice this with their wives. They should be quick to hear their wives, but slow to speak to them. For example, if your wife complains to you about something, you will be wise if you hear her but are slow to speak. If you speak in haste, you may stir up a fire that can cause serious problems. </p>

Behold, how great a forest a little fire kindles! And the tongue is a fire, the world of unrighteousness; the tongue is set among our members, contaminating the whole body and setting on <span class="pg" data-page-id="69" id="69">[69]</span> fire the course of life and is set on fire by Gehenna.” Gehenna is the symbol of the lake of fire—hell (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99743" data-verses="Revelation 20:15">Rev. 20:15</span>). The “fire” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99744" data-verses="James 3:5">verse 5</span> is a wildfire with spreading power, and the fire in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99745" data-verses="James 3:6">verse 6</span> is an evil fire from Gehenna that contaminates us. Like the wildfire the tongue spreads its destruction, and like the evil fire it contaminates our whole body with evils from Gehenna. </p>
<p data-content-id="OVAeN2DXaqLJojqZo2IXPexUP6ZRmFwAiRRUvMwNiDYzqbFww6oRqWHaPXQNuENL2"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99746" data-verses="James 3:6">verse 6</span> the Greek word for “course” is <em>trochos,</em> referring generally to anything round or circular which runs or rolls, like a wheel. Used figuratively, it indicates a circuit of physical effects, a course, like the orbit around the sun. The Greek word for “life” is <em>genesis,</em> meaning origin, birth, generation; hence, the wheel of birth referring figuratively to our human life, set in motion at its birth and running on to its close. The tongue as an evil fire from Gehenna sets on fire our human life, as a wheel, from our birth to our death, so that the course of our entire life may be wholly under the tongue’s evil contamination and corruption. </p>
<p data-content-id="45EnWoIR7NmkPb9fHC3PtdTmrtMLBuE8f8sEgUHIt-_b2sWxnUl87G2dTFzSNPMjp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99747" data-verses="James 3:7-8">verses 7 and 8a</span> James goes on to say, “For every nature, both of beasts and of birds, both of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human nature; but the tongue no one among men is able to tame.” Every nature of beasts on the land, of birds in the air, of reptiles in the dust, and of creatures in the water, has been tamed by the nature of man, which is stronger than all the animal natures. However, even the stronger human nature is not able to tame the tongue. </p>
<p data-content-id="oApZhckfvnkF01f7RgUplYaW4WtEvsUZRGslQ5NFHWBuYIaiDa10Ld5RbTXSNwORW"> In 8b James says that the tongue is a “restless evil, full of death-bringing poison.” As a restless evil the tongue never ceases to do evil. It is full of death-bringing poison. Evil and death go together with the tongue. It spreads evil and death to contaminate and poison all human beings. It is the same even among Christians. </p>

He was rich, somewhat like Solomon, the wise king of the Old Testament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99749" data-verses="1Kings 4:29-34">1 Kings 4:29-34</span>), in wisdom concerning human life, but not so in wisdom concerning the divine economy. </p>

Let him show by his good manner of life his works in meekness of wisdom.” According to the context, meekness of wisdom should refer here to restraint in speaking. This corresponds to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99751" data-verses="Proverbs 10:19">Proverbs 10:19</span>. Such meekness equals forbearing and yielding in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99752" data-verses="James 3:17">verse 17</span>, in contrast to bitter jealousy and rivalry in boasting and lying in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99753" data-verses="James 3:14">verse 14</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="YGhoMmNbfDp0bWKM5hwHbw0WK9BDqxeUmBqmzniy71FQtNkmC5DbjEuj6ntsBIPxv"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99754" data-verses="James 3:13">verse 13</span> James mentions being wise before having understanding. If we do not have wisdom, we cannot have understanding. Knowing this, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99755" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span> Paul prayed that God would grant us a spirit of wisdom. Whereas a wise man has understanding, a foolish person is not able to understand others. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ElMrEAlP8ftT0YOzkn-kDxMTyesFUrUWVk2jaIcn3gBsLxmLn-lZGxYX8zNGXMIOl">WISDOM AND OUR SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="DYpvfwthyMvCF0ygRg22sUAqWxFkQKG87X3toUjpjunZ2pW9fdlKIIWbVXL8-7eXw"> What is wisdom? It is very difficult to say what wisdom is, because wisdom is abstract. Understanding is in our mind, but where is wisdom? According to my experience, wisdom is in our spirit. This means that wisdom is found not in our mind, emotion, will, soul, or heart; wisdom is in our deepest part. When we exercise our spirit, stay in the spirit in every situation, and do things according to the spirit, we shall have wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="SwctBFggzfUJglQ24tuTxmw4DegfC2ynIFcZ-a3lHZphym2Zh-6IKR76NGlGm68fy"> When some hear that wisdom is in the spirit, they may say, “James was a man who emphasized wisdom in practical Christian perfection. Why did he not say that wisdom is in our spirit?” Although James does not say this explicitly, he gives us a hint that wisdom is in our spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99756" data-verses="James 3:17">3:17</span> he speaks of “the wisdom from above.” Here “from above” means from God. Anything that comes to us from God must touch our spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99757" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span> says that God is Spirit and that they who worship Him must worship in spirit. This indicates that in <span class="pg" data-page-id="71" id="71">[71]</span> order to contact God, we must use our spirit. Likewise, when God contacts us, He touches our spirit. Hence, the wisdom that comes from above, from God, must surely come to our spirit. It does not come to our mind, soul, or heart; it comes to our spirit, our God-contacting organ. Therefore, it is correct to say that here we have a hint that wisdom is in our spirit. </p>

However, before we consider these matters, I would like to give a further brief word on the contrast between wisdom as it is revealed in the writings of James and wisdom as revealed in the writings of Paul. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0m4z7WjaQSszGQbFUoS9_gFUgm_CJjCl1isgWe7WUIcWTz8MItSGLw_UyXo-zA-S2">TWO LEVELS OF WISDOM</h2><p data-content-id="7BRJEZD5gkWtHTSTJ-xcrobApNzBAd1_8iopN4prHuN_80zcw6hfQznB3G6mac_0M"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99782" data-verses="James 1:5">1:5</span> James says, “If anyone of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and does not reproach, and it will be given to him.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99783" data-verses="James 3:13">3:13</span> James says, “Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good manner of life his works in meekness of wisdom.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99784" data-verses="James 3:17">3:17</span> James tells us, “The wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, forbearing, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, unfeigned.” All these are characteristics of practical Christian perfection according to James’ view, which may have been somewhat under the influence of Old Testament precepts concerning man’s behavior, morality, and ethics (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99785" data-verses="Proverbs 4:5-8">Prov. 4:5-8</span>). What James says concerning wisdom is on the level of human character. This wisdom does not attain to the height of the wisdom concerning the hidden mystery of God’s New Testament economy regarding Christ and the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99786" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:6-8">1 Cor. 2:6-8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99787" data-verses="Ephesians 3:9-11">Eph. 3:9-11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="_jAGz6lO6aQbYP8SEIUgbfciZU-fMVsgR8eZyvghebuCayzBaptVemk7u2CVoPIrs"> In his writing regarding wisdom, James does not say a word concerning Christ as life or concerning the church being built up through the experience of the riches of Christ for His expression. Furthermore, in the entire book of James the <span class="pg" data-page-id="78" id="78">[78]</span> Spirit of God is mentioned only once (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99788" data-verses="James 4:5">4:5</span>), and that in a negative way. The human spirit is not mentioned at all. By this we see that three crucial matters are not touched by James in his Epistle: Christ as life, the building up of the church through the riches of Christ, and the human spirit. James’ only mention of the Holy Spirit of God is in relation to striving against lust (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99789" data-verses="James 4:5">4:5</span>). Because of the shortage in these matters, there is no possibility for James to attain the height of wisdom that we see in the Epistles of Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="sgaJhVd0CHmZbDx-GmthV7Hl3XGxfCmdQQwTN1779ExoH8fF4Gs-v_8h3eWfzUvw6"> In his Epistle James seems to present wisdom as something given to us by God once for all. Paul’s understanding of wisdom is much higher. According to Paul, wisdom is actually Christ Himself, the embodiment of God, who has been installed in us and who is now being continually transmitted into us. The installation was made once for all, but the transmission is not once for all; it is continuous. We may use electricity as an illustration. Electricity is installed in a building once for all. But once electricity has been installed, there should be a continuous transmission of electricity from the power plant to the building. </p>
<p data-content-id="wYSIhyq_rpfIziGhUy26M0PGmbdTIqcSm9oPTJyiFlWgr2WnPxu5jmwezQdUTBEhQ"> The wisdom taught by James is something given by God. But the wisdom taught by Paul is Christ continually transmitting Himself into us. This divine transmission is the divine dispensing. For electricity to be transmitted into a building means that it is dispensed into the building to be used in different ways by those in the building. The principle is the same with Christ as wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="LS6kRlvGM2hNFluLNN_Ws6THw0yLpAwCGGM_uBa2MItwvgqfcwY8YiMwZG_FGi4YI"> As the embodiment of the Triune God, Christ has been installed in our tripartite being to be transmitted, dispensed, into us all the time so that we may live a life to express Christ and so that the church, the Body of Christ, may be built up as His fullness. What heights Paul reaches in his writing concerning Christ as our wisdom from God! </p>
<p data-content-id="mRRelVDEpjqf_Vdz3NsW1gWy9iVSyUtFbZafu_sd4qYMilnuxUd08br5r0BPfN4at"> It is of the Lord’s sovereignty that the Epistle of James comes after the fourteen Epistles of Paul. In Paul’s Epistles we see a wisdom that is on the highest level. In James’ Epistle we see a wisdom that is on another level, a level of human living. <span class="pg" data-page-id="79" id="79">[79]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Z_QYjjzQfwAuHxubP9WMPhytLSuO7FgCmszveENwgpdHP7uTFSH0k0z4w33taCtWD"> As we consider the picture of these two levels of wisdom, we shall know where we should be. We should be in God’s economy and in practical Christian perfection. On the one hand, we must be for God’s economy. God’s economy is to dispense Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God into us for the building up of the church as the fullness of Christ. Practical Christian perfection is related to being complete and entire in our conduct, character, and behavior so that we may have a positive testimony before others and even in the sight of angels and demons. If we have such practical Christian perfection, no one will be able to blame us. For God’s economy, we need to be those with the practical Christian perfection portrayed by James in his Epistle. Now we can see why these two levels of wisdom—one in the Epistles of Paul and the other in the Epistle of James—are unveiled in the New Testament. </p>

Some may be bothered by the fact that we use the word “pleasures” in a negative sense. In our church life we do not have pleasures—we have enjoyment. In fact, our church life is an enjoyment. This enjoyment is a very positive thing, but worldly pleasures are extremely negative. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99791" data-verses="James 4:1-10">4:1-10</span> James ranks pleasures with the world and the Devil. One of the virtues of Christian perfection is to overcome pleasures, the world, and the Devil. </p>

Are they not from this, from your pleasures that war in your members?” The pleasures here are pleasures of the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="-2VHxF_AgLgVwx9u2or5Qb30DlycWFxva7OZG9tT2zdkWTzUkomslY_VVBU07m3zk"> James’ word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99793" data-verses="James 4:1">chapter four</span> is rather mixed and not easy to understand. For instance, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99794" data-verses="James 4:1">verse 1</span> James speaks of wars and fightings among those who receive his Epistle. Do you believe that in ancient times there were wars and fightings among the Jewish believers in Jerusalem and among those scattered in the Gentile world? At least to some extent, I do <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> not believe this. How could the believers have been fighting, warring, with one another? James says that these wars and fightings come from the pleasures that war in our members. </p>
<p data-content-id="pFwPagCi1CBtYCo_i1CB4p1PEhQe--MV_oIBGzZCPV_Gd0Uregl17w5aL9aFJaOIW"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99795" data-verses="James 4:2">4:2</span> James continues, “You desire and do not have; you murder and are jealous, and are not able to obtain; you fight and war. You do not have because you do not ask.” Here “desire” means covet, lust. How are we to understand this verse? In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99796" data-verses="James 4:1">verse 1</span> James speaks of two kinds of wars, wars among the saints and wars in our members. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99797" data-verses="James 4:2">verse 2</span> he says, “You fight and war.” He also says, “You murder and are jealous.” I am bothered by what James says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99798" data-verses="James 4:2">verse 2</span>. I believe that this sense of being bothered is due to the mixture of Judaism with New Testament teachings in James’ writing. James was saturated with the ideas, concepts, teachings, ordinances, and practices of the Jewish religion. He was soaked with the element of that religion, and had lived a long time in its sphere and atmosphere. Furthermore, he treasured the things of Judaism. Nevertheless, James was deeply influenced by New Testament teachings. This means that with James there are two elements, two spheres, and two atmospheres. The result is a mixture in his thinking, a mixture of Judaism with the teachings of the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="vLXobqmKfCTOj83eFKQiqNMQP5ufj026yd3A_-mbgE6bGSvvzsbUl3y01-QH5Pv3t"> Although I have studied <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99799" data-verses="James 4:1-10">4:1-10</span>, I find it very difficult to cut these verses straight, to divide them properly. Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99800" data-verses="2Timothy 2:13">2 Timothy 2:13</span> regarding cutting straight the word of the truth indicates that we should not divide the Word in a zigzag fashion. But when we come to the book of James, we simply cannot cut or divide the Word in a straight line. As an example of this difficulty, I would call your attention to the word “murder” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99801" data-verses="James 4:2">4:2</span>. This word bothers me very much, and I cannot understand what James means by it. Surely James does not mean that believers were actually murdering one another. However, can we spiritualize the word “murder” here? We can easily understand what Paul means in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99802" data-verses="Romans 8:13">Romans 8:13</span> when he speaks of putting to death the practices of the body, but who can understand what James means by murder in this verse? Who was being murdered by whom? </p>

The latter part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99857" data-verses="James 4:6">verse 6</span> is a quotation from the Septuagint, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99858" data-verses="Proverbs 3:34">Proverbs 3:34</span>. This verse says, “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.” According to the context, this means to be proud toward God. Being proud toward God causes Him to resist us. To be humble is also toward God, and this causes Him to give us grace, as He desires. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99871" data-verses="James 1:8">1:8</span>, being double-souled is related to doubting in prayer. God made man only one soul with one mind and one will.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99872" data-verses="James 4:8">4:8</span> being double-souled is a matter of having the heart divided for two parties—God and the world.

He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge. One is Lawgiver and Judge, who is able to save and destroy. But who are you who judges your neighbor?” Notice that in these verses James mentions the law four times. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99879" data-verses="James 4:12">verse 12</span> he refers to God as the Lawgiver. James’ word here and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99880" data-verses="James 2:8-11">2:8-11</span> regarding the Old Testament law and his words in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99881" data-verses="James 1:25">1:25</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99882" data-verses="James 2:12">2:12</span> regarding the perfect law of freedom may indicate that in his understanding there is no distinction between keeping the Old Testament law and living by the perfect law of freedom, the inner law of life. But according to the divine revelation in the entire New Testament, there is a definite, clear distinction between the two. Keeping the Old Testament law merely makes us right with God and men so that we might be justified by the law. But living by the inner law of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99883" data-verses="Hebrews 8:10-11">Heb. 8:10-11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99884" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Rom. 8:2</span>) is to live and magnify Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99885" data-verses="Philippians 1:20-21">Phil. 1:20-21</span>) for the building up of His Body to express Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99886" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22-23">Eph. 1:22-23</span>) and for the building of God’s house to satisfy Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99887" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">1 Tim. 3:15</span>). This is for the accomplishment of God’s eternal goal according to His New Testament economy. Though we become perfect by keeping the Old Testament law, we are still void of God’s eternal goal. Only living by the inner law of life avails for this. Such a living spontaneously and unconsciously fulfills more than what is required under the Old Testament law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99888" data-verses="Romans 8:4">Rom. 8:4</span>), even to the standard of the constitution of the kingdom, as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99889" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapters five through seven</span> of the Gospel of Matthew. </p>

<p data-content-id="5VAeA4mi_BzoP4UTvvXk7Ad1Ys_WjnjQtw9LkAyEvPthr3EV_kNsknNdn8NKKnb2a"> Once again, I would like to point out the contrast between James’ emphasis on practical Christian perfection and Paul’s emphasis in his Epistles concerning the experience of Christ for the producing of the church. If we have a clear view of this comparison, we shall see the need to go on from the human level, stressed in the book of James, to the divine level, stressed in the Epistles of Paul. On the divine level we know Christ, experience Christ, and possess Christ for the building up of the church, His body, as His expression. I hope that the book of James will help us to see this contrast. </p>

In any case, his word arouses a fear of one’s self-will and a confidence in God, as expressed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99909" data-verses="James 4:15">verse 15</span>. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99931" data-verses="James 5:1">5:1</span> James says to the rich, “Come now, you rich, weep, howling over your miseries which are coming upon you!” </p>

Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99933" data-verses="James 5:4">verse 4</span> he goes on to say, “Behold, the wages of the workmen who mowed your fields, which has been withheld by you, cries out, and the cries of those who reaped, have entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts.” As in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99934" data-verses="Romans 9:29">Romans 9:29</span>, “Lord of hosts” is the equivalent of the divine title in Hebrew, <em>Jehovah-Sabaoth,</em> which means Jehovah of hosts, Jehovah of armies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99935" data-verses="1Samuel 1:3">1 Sam. 1:3</span>). Such a title bears a Jewish character, color, tone, and flavor. This is a further confirmation of the fact that James still cared very much for Jewish things. </p>

<p data-content-id="PqI5bcRSCMX2VJnk3PNAV1-vTxfCVjHYfSB33BKcR23qaKrC0PH--2ZbdKvG0NLNz"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99939" data-verses="James 5:6">verse 6</span> James says, “You condemned, you murdered the righteous; he does not resist you.” In this verse “the righteous” is in the collective singular with the article used for the class. It does not refer directly to any individual, but pictures the death of the Lord Jesus, who is the Righteous (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99940" data-verses="Acts 7:52">Acts 7:52</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99941" data-verses="Acts 3:14">3:14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="-2VHxF_AgLgVwx9u2o7ZQb3UDlycWFxva7OZG9tT2zdkWTzUkomslY_VVBU07m3zk"> It is difficult to say to whom <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99942" data-verses="James 5:1-6">5:1-6</span> is addressed. There is some disagreement among Bible teachers concerning this point. It is rather certain that these verses were not addressed merely to believers. I believe that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99943" data-verses="James 5:1-6">5:1-6</span> is addressed to the Jewish people in a general way. </p>
<p data-content-id="pFwPagCi1CBtYCo_i1Sh4pFHEhQe--MV_oIBGzZCPV_Gd0Uregl17w5aL9aFJaOIW"> This understanding is confirmed by the fact that according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99944" data-verses="James 1:1">1:1</span>, this Epistle is addressed to “the twelve tribes in the dispersion.” James’ concept probably was that the Jewish believers were to be regarded as still among the Jewish people. Therefore, he addressed his Epistle to the Jewish believers but also to all the Jews. This may help us to understand why James addressed this Epistle to the twelve tribes. </p>
<p data-content-id="vLXobqmKfCTOj83eFKACqN8YP5ufj026yd3A_-mbgE6bGSvvzsbUl3y01-QH5Pv3t"> If the Epistle of James is addressed both to Jewish believers and to Jewish people in general, this may help us understand what James says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99945" data-verses="James 4:1">chapter four</span> about wars, fightings, and murder (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99946" data-verses="James 4:1-2">vv. 1-2</span>). Among the Jews there probably were fightings and even murders. This may mean that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99947" data-verses="James 4:1-2">4:1-2</span> James speaks concerning fightings among the Jews that originated with their lusts. </p>
<p data-content-id="W7WtXlPtgrNZCLCrkmc-w4fNeOktPH64lEPWmyE5BD5VObGt2sMOZIySFfyzkddGt"> As a whole, James’ writing is somewhat ambiguous. Because he was under the thick cloud of Judaic concepts, his view was not clear. Furthermore, at least to some extent James was sympathetic with Judaism. On the one hand, his Epistle touches New Testament concepts; on the other hand, in this Epistle James still keeps certain Old Testament concepts. Hence, his writing is a mixture. As we have pointed out, the title Lord of hosts in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99948" data-verses="James 5:4">5:4</span> points to the Jewish character of this book. <span class="pg" data-page-id="97" id="97">[97]</span> </p>

First he talks to the rich among the Jews, and then he speaks to Christians about waiting for the Lord’s coming back. I find it difficult to believe that James could write in this way.

<p data-content-id="H4mDMgr9QwAR4L0KmVWRb2lXbi1NzVHL8-wSuiWy2LLYbGIotF5E8ZpL7mlM2RwvU"> The Greek word for “coming” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99961" data-verses="James 5:7">5:7</span> is <em>parousia,</em> presence. Christ’s coming will be His presence with His believers. This <em>parousia</em> will begin with His coming to the air and end with His coming to the earth. Within His <em>parousia,</em> there will be the rapture of the majority of the believers to the air (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99962" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:15-17">1 Thes. 4:15-17</span>), the judgment seat of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99963" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:10">2 Cor. 5:10</span>), and the marriage of the Lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99964" data-verses="Revelation 19:7-9">Rev. 19:7-9</span>). </p>

James uses the prophets as an example. The prophets spoke in the name of the Lord. Speaking in the name of the Lord indicates that the prophets were one with the Lord. Hence, their suffering and longsuffering were with the Lord and for the Lord. The suffering and longsuffering of the faithful believers should be the same. </p>

You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very compassionate and full of pity.” In this verse “endured” and “endurance” are translations of the Greek words <em>hupomeno,</em> verb, and <em>hupomone,</em> noun, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99978" data-verses="Romans 5:3">Romans 5:3</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99979" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:6">2 Corinthians 1:6</span>.

We have seen that the Lord Jesus is actually the real Farmer, the unique Farmer. As we are awaiting His coming, He, as the real Farmer, is awaiting our maturity. We may pray, “Lord, come back quickly.” However, He may say, “My children, mature quicker. While you are awaiting My coming back, I am awaiting your maturity. Do you know why it has been nearly two thousand years and I have not yet come back? The reason is that My people are not yet matured. Only your maturity can hasten My coming back. You exercise your longsuffering, and I exercise My longsuffering.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="99" id="99">[99]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="qHEMv1_QlV3K2aWcpBghbw8ZGmCZLmUxZ6_2zrUtpceAKYao9MrurJnGkKYo22QDn"> It is a great help for us to realize that if we are serious about awaiting the Lord’s coming back, we need to grow in life. Most Christians today view the Lord’s coming in an altogether objective way, in a way that has nothing to do with our spiritual condition or spiritual growth. Their expectation is that one day the Lord will suddenly come, and that His coming will have nothing to do with their maturity. It may be that the concepts many Christians hold regarding the Lord’s coming back are actually causing Him to delay His coming. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1KTwyQK4tHZ9rxJcEPN0VE44k6rwZ7l0zNaOpQTEbh3mXt5ffmH8FCboj1fmIOmnW">SPEAKING HONESTLY WITHOUT SWEARING</h2><p data-content-id="99BuAZ8jJtyNc0LCPMZasrg33R7V_QFXtT-pcKhwRfWxiKQ2M3Aeu5ykQnK8Ndlsz"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99988" data-verses="James 5:12">5:12</span> James says, “But above all things, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth, or with any other oath; but let your yes be yes, and your no be no, that you do not fall under judgment.” We should not swear, because we are nothing, and nothing is under our control or up to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99989" data-verses="Matthew 5:34-36">Matt. 5:34-36</span>). To swear displays the acting of our self-will and our forgetfulness of God. But to let our yes be yes and our no be no is to act according to the divine nature we have received through regeneration, in the consciousness of the presence of God, with the denial of our self-will and sinful nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="jAg8aG9aP0-tG1UwqGsgkMxAhWr2eb8eEXW94YOstk32l-sMgwfMau9lQc54C1is1"> What James says in this verse reminds us of the word of the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99990" data-verses="Matthew 5:37">Matthew 5:37</span>: “But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for whatever is more than this is of the evil one.” Here the Lord is saying that our word should be simple and true: “Yes, yes; No, no.” We should not try to convince others with many words. </p>
<p data-content-id="ElMrEAlP8ftT0YOzknuMDx8LyesFUrUWVk2jaIcn3gBsLxmLn-lZGxYX8zNGXMIOl"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99991" data-verses="James 5:12">5:12</span> James says that if our yes is yes and our no is no, we shall not fall under judgment. Our genuine faithfulness and sincerity in our words according to the divine nature we partake of will keep us from God’s judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="DYpvfwthyMvCF0ygRgmesUwyWxFkQKG87X3toUjpjunZ2pW9fdlKIIWbVXL8-7eXw"> Once again, James’ word about judgment reminds us of a word spoken by the Lord Jesus. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99992" data-verses="Matthew 12:36-37">Matthew 12:36 and 37</span> the <span class="pg" data-page-id="104" id="104">[104]</span> Lord says, “I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they shall render account concerning it in the day of judgment; for by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be convicted.” The Greek word for “idle” is <em>argos,</em> composed of two words: <em>a</em> meaning not, and <em>ergon</em> meaning work. An idle word is a non-working word, an inoperative word, having no positive function, useless, unprofitable, unfruitful, and barren. In the day of judgment those who speak such words will render account concerning every one of them. Because this is the case, how much more must we account for every wicked word! In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99993" data-verses="Matthew 5:37">Matthew 5:37</span> the Lord gives us a serious warning. This warning indicates to us that we must learn to control and restrict our speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="SwctBFggzfUJglQ24t-7xmAQDegfC2ynIFcZ-a3lHZphym2Zh-6IKR76NGlGm68fy"> What James says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99994" data-verses="James 5:12">5:12</span> fits in with the subject of this Epistle—practical Christian perfection. Our way of speaking has much to do with this. Speaking honestly and with restraint is a virtue of Christian perfection. But if we are loose in our speaking, we will fall short of much perfection. Therefore, after telling us not to swear, James says that our yes should be yes and our no should be no, so that we may not fall under judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="gpYKPvtdYclKhrJW9Or2rgrTlJcfBVJggz89XvIwZ8elNOMdNNR6T7BAC4HqUxp3H"> As a godly man, James could never forget the coming judgment, and he lived under this judgment. I hope that we all shall have the understanding that whatever we do will be judged. For example, our talk on the telephone will be judged by the Lord. When some sisters are on the telephone, they talk without any restraint. Apparently, they do not realize that whatever they say will one day be judged according to the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99995" data-verses="Matthew 12:36-37">Matthew 12:36-37</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="eko9UtlmbjVTttTRUC_fQDd39stCBvVf0RUpz2KYr7MNBTzt0jRkMWR9Tom-GE5ul"> Concerning swearing and unrestrained speaking, James was serious. However, certain believers are not serious regarding these things. To them, it seems that there will not be any judgment. They may have the concept that once they have been saved from eternal perdition, there will be no more problems. But we know according to the New Testament that all believers will have to give an account to the Lord at His judgment seat. </p>
<p data-content-id="5VAeA4mi_BzoP4UTvvXs7AttYs_WjnjQtw9LkAyEvPthr3EV_kNsknNdn8NKKnb2a"> What was on James’ heart as he was writing this Epistle was the matter of practical Christian perfection. Because of <span class="pg" data-page-id="105" id="105">[105]</span> his concern for Christian perfection, he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99996" data-verses="James 5:12">5:12</span>, “Above all things, my brothers, do not swear.” After saying so much about the tongue in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99997" data-verses="James 3:1">chapter three</span>, he gives such a word about swearing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99998" data-verses="James 5:12">5:12</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="NSePEbfnjgokxvAriojQyplyjILBxBlfLERYtNaYkAdpJWRyGW0cHgE12ZZlXZGuU"> Anyone who swears is not an honest person. He who swears is a liar. Anyone who is honest has no need to swear. The reason we Christians should not swear is that we are honest. Anyone who swears is a person who is pretending, and his swearing is a sign that he is not honest. Swearing, therefore, is a sign of pretense. </p>
<p data-content-id="t0d1t2V0HH1NR-t9vS2tl_1UCT5YyoyheBAEOg9m-xpl2nZ_fvHabIskpbQUaxpFx"> The basic reason for not swearing, however, is that nothing is under our control. Neither heaven nor earth is ours. Actually, we do not even belong to ourselves, and we cannot control anything. Because nothing is under our control, we should not make an oath. Once again we see that our speaking needs to be restricted. </p>
<p data-content-id="h0oyZ4RHIegww8ONrZUREcX9sqChQB9YLcis0lJvDP2oHMeV-6S-r3mp_M9SBC9aV"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99999" data-verses="James 5:12">5:12</span> James indicates that we should not speak excessively. Unnecessary talk always causes trouble. If we speak carelessly, we may exaggerate and not be honest. But if our speaking is restrained, we can exercise ourselves to speak honestly. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UZYZTt6u-1IBs1qS0NCIYmRV79YyagBJtVcgdknThiQnYlKAX3Sy-4UcWtwgFSadE">HEALTHY PRACTICES IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="M5k0MSEHgd3kpvHyxtxppjvMFeYIEoEbYdxgZ7SbLZ9AgZo8AtxdxyUeNVdBxvC2t">Praying</h2>

Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.” Praying brings us the strength of the Lord to endure suffering, and singing praise keeps us in the joy of the Lord. The Greek words rendered “sing praise” also mean sing psalms, or play on a stringed instrument. Whether we pray or sing praise, we should contact God. In any environment and under any circumstance, humble or exalted, grievous or joyful, we need to contact the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="iCOojXOyxqA-I1jMT0wCL6goWVTlHunjJ3KKahF8eEJoQMRJhwth8ID_92Ux8Ncvj"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100001" data-verses="James 5:14">verse 14</span> James continues, “Is anyone among you weak? Let him call to him the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil in the name of the Lord.” In this verse James refers to someone who is weak <span class="pg" data-page-id="106" id="106">[106]</span> because of sickness. Weakness leads to sickness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100002" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:30">1 Cor. 11:30</span>), and sickness causes more weakness. </p>
<p data-content-id="1KTwyQK4tHZ9rxJcEPN0VFsck6rwZ7l0zNaOpQTEbh3mXt5ffmH8FCboj1fmIOmnW"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100003" data-verses="James 5:14">verse 14</span> James encourages the one who is weak to call the elders of the church. To call the elders of the church to pray for weakness due to sickness implies that there is no problem between the calling one and the church represented by the elders; that restitution has been made between the calling one and the church, if the sickness is due to the calling one’s having offended the church (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100004" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:29-32">1 Cor. 11:29-32</span>); and that there has been a thorough confession of sins one to another by the sick one and the elders (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100005" data-verses="James 5:16">James 5:16</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="99BuAZ8jJtyNc0LCPMZaspEP3R7V_QFXtT-pcKhwRfWxiKQ2M3Aeu5ykQnK8Ndlsz">Anointing with Oil in the Name of the Lord</h2><p data-content-id="jAg8aG9aP0-tG1UwqGsgkOF8hWr2eb8eEXW94YOstk32l-sMgwfMau9lQc54C1is1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100006" data-verses="James 5:14">verse 14</span> James speaks of anointing with oil in the name of the Lord. Two Greek words are translated anoint: <em>aleipho,</em> the word used here and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100007" data-verses="John 12:3">John 12:3</span>, is the common term for applying oil: <em>chrio</em> means to anoint officially for office as priest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100008" data-verses="Acts 10:38">Acts 10:38</span>), king (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100009" data-verses="Hebrews 1:9">Heb. 1:9</span>), or prophet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100010" data-verses="Luke 4:18">Luke 4:18</span>). <em>Chrio</em> in connection with <em>Christos</em> (Christ) is used for the anointing of the Son by the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100011" data-verses="Acts 10:38">Acts 10:38</span>). To anoint with oil signifies to impart the Spirit of life, who has been poured upon the Body of Christ as the anointing oil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100012" data-verses="Psalms 133:2">Psa. 133:2</span>), to the sick member of the Body, through the representation of the elders of the church, for the healing of the sick one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100013" data-verses="1John 5:16">1 John 5:16</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="TPbSm9yJ3rRwyvrez0pLbjhykfVs4kW1qhdYl1eP-0GOCiFs_osAKvx9pORTanX1Y"> “In the name of the Lord” signifies oneness with the Lord. The anointing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100014" data-verses="James 5:14">5:14</span> is not by elders alone, but by their being one with the Lord, representing both the Body and the Head. </p>
<p data-content-id="n7dJkkKWDa-cR2INo3Ylnl5KrFvgS2JQ6tN9l2G97X0fdPtNaqc2g74V2__VxhAkK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100015" data-verses="James 5:14">verse 14</span> we have the only direct mention of the church in the book of James. The one time James speaks of the church is in reference to the negative matter of healing sickness. Furthermore, the matter of turning back a brother who has been led astray from the truth is also a matter related to the church life. Hence, what James says concerning the church involves negative matters, praying for the sick and restoring backsliders. </p>

<p data-content-id="mRRelVDEpjqf_Vdz3N8-1hyW9iVSyUtFbZafu_sd4qYMilnuxUd08br5r0BPfN4at"> James was a very godly man, and, humanly speaking, he was quite wise. But in instance after instance we see that James was occupied too much with Old Testament matters. No doubt, he was saturated, soaked, with the feeling, flavor, and atmosphere of the Old Testament. We cannot find a strong indication with James that he passed through the Old Testament dispensation fully into the New Testament economy. Probably James had been baptized. However, according to his writings, I do not believe that he ever experienced a thorough termination and burial of himself along with all the things of the past, both good and bad. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Z_QYjjzQfwAuHxubP9GkPjmVLSuO7FgCmszveENwgpdHP7uTFSH0k0z4w33taCtWD">STILL KEEPING THE TWELVE TRIBES<br/>OF THE OLD TESTAMENT DISPENSATION</h2><p data-content-id="ACrxPCAbTyeEK9ijMugxAmyZzNGLD3fQWDAgQyRbXWPuyllv0cqdjLIS6O9hVazZu"> In his Epistle James still keeps the twelve tribes of the Old Testament dispensation. This is indicated by the way James begins this book: “James, a slave of God and of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="114" id="114">[114]</span> Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the dispersion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100083" data-verses="James 1:1">1:1</span>).” The fact that James addresses his Epistle to the twelve tribes in the dispersion may indicate the lack of a clear view concerning the distinction between Christians and Jews, between God’s New Testament economy and the Old Testament dispensation. James may not have been clear that God in the New Testament has delivered and separated the Jewish believers in Christ from the Jewish nation. Therefore, the expression “twelve tribes” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100084" data-verses="James 1:1">1:1</span> is too old; it is something of the Old Testament dispensation. </p>
<p data-content-id="IhVkL5UA-Ai1UijWBYzwvgepfnGJDU-L1DOjYbPobA6Mn6GD-tboE0USWnkJTJXpw"> According to Paul’s writings, the Jewish believers in Christ have been called by God out of the old dispensation. In the book of Galatians Paul even regards Judaism as the present evil age: “Who gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100085" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">1:4</span>).” According to the context of the entire book of Galatians, the present evil age in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100086" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">Galatians 1:4</span> refers to the religious world, the religious course of the world, the Jewish religion. This is confirmed by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100087" data-verses="Galatians 6:14-15">Galatians 6:14-15</span>, where circumcision is considered a part of the world, the religious world, which is crucified to the Apostle Paul. Therefore, Paul indicates in the book of Galatians that Christ gave Himself for our sins in order to rescue us out of the Jewish religious world, the present evil age. </p>
<p data-content-id="H4mDMgr9QwAR4L0KmVWZb2l3bi1NzVHL8-wSuiWy2LLYbGIotF5E8ZpL7mlM2RwvU"> The present evil age in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100088" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">Galatians 1:4</span> is equal to the “perverse generation” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100089" data-verses="Acts 2:40">Acts 2:40</span>. On the day of Pentecost Peter told the people to be saved from this perverse generation. How, then, could such a godly person as James address his Epistle, which was written to Christian Jews, to the twelve tribes in the dispersion? This certainly was contrary to God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XDun9BVEhG9rQp0vKH0hNUo2_HWTQ-CwfgV3cPGhtP7FFg6PyitIwqHazOECZ_i-O">POSSESSING THE DIVINE LIFE<br/>THROUGH THE DIVINE BIRTH</h2><p data-content-id="kjrSvRAcdIYGgsz_SuLjx5T7oNxzjoOqmNLWQDF1YmZZNsg4nPtS2foqp9tODma79"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100090" data-verses="James 1:17-18">1:17 and 18</span> James says, “All good giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the lights, with whom is no variableness or shadow cast by turning. Having purposed, He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a certain firstfruit of His creatures.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="115" id="115">[115]</span> These verses indicate that the Father of lights brought us forth to be the firstfruit of His creatures. This refers to the divine birth, our regeneration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100091" data-verses="John 3:5-6">John 3:5-6</span>), which is carried out according to God’s eternal purpose. The fact that we have been brought forth by the word of truth means that the word is the seed of life, by which we have been regenerated (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100092" data-verses="1Peter 1:23">1 Pet. 1:23</span>). Therefore, James indicates that we possess the divine life through the divine birth. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jc4x4KXCavfkhV6qotb7aWXky9q8T38eDRXNXg-DYj0P6DN-lP-ystrS-gsnggFxK"> On the one hand, James addresses his Epistle to the twelve tribes. On the other hand, he speaks regarding the divine life received through the divine birth. The twelve tribes are something altogether of the Old Testament, whereas the divine life received through the divine birth is certainly a matter of the New Testament. What a mixture there is in the writing of James! He mixes the Old Testament with the New Testament. How could those regenerated by God, begotten of Him, still be addressed as the twelve tribes? How could James speak to the twelve tribes and then say that God has brought them forth to be a certain firstfruit of His creatures? Nevertheless, this is what James did in this book. How could the twelve tribes be brought forth by God to be a certain firstfruit? When we compare <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100093" data-verses="James 1:1">1:1</span> with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100094" data-verses="James 1:17-18">1:17 and 18</span>, we see how cloudy was the situation with James, as indicated by this Epistle. </p>
<p data-content-id="zw-QNh3bJjXHUWGoer_Dwdd0UHLHhiQcqVMAqhfCTI8JU9Frqis4EsjolTsxdHVgc"> At this point I wish to say that we should not be attracted to a person simply because he is godly. Throughout the centuries, many godly people have been in a cloudy condition with respect to God’s economy. They were under a cloud, veiled by their godliness. It is possible for us to be misled by a godly person just as Paul was misled by the godly James in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100095" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span>. It is not easy to avoid the influence of a situation that is spiritually cloudy. </p>
<p data-content-id="aXWDsCw7hDoNWis49VWJ7PikqsSAlC1fgsToKd4nqaSqp--ppGDRHSPQeGdbYYBN2"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100096" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span> Paul took James’ suggestion to go to the temple with certain ones who had a vow and to pay the charge for them. We may think that in doing this Paul was broad and acting according to his word to the Corinthians: “To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order that I might gain Jews; to those under law, as under law (not being myself under law), that I might gain those under law” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100097" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:20">1 Cor. 9:20</span>). But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100098" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span> the <span class="pg" data-page-id="116" id="116">[116]</span> Lord was not as broad as Paul supposedly was. On the last day of the vow, the seventh day, a disturbance took place, and Paul was arrested. If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100099" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span> carefully, we shall see that the Lord did not agree with what was happening in Jerusalem, and He came in to deal with it. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bQia7yaJ-FE89WGzCJf2zkWJm1CNeT4exZMXdix86tnN_PWdvNRjSLRFm0BsMkGpw">RECEIVING THE IMPLANTED WORD</h2><p data-content-id="qHEMv1_QlV3K2aWcpBgpbwMhGmCZLmUxZ6_2zrUtpceAKYao9MrurJnGkKYo22QDn"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100100" data-verses="James 1:21">1:21</span> James says, “Wherefore, putting away all filthiness and abundance of malice, receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.” In this verse James likens the word of God to a plant of life planted into our being and growing in us to bring forth fruit for the salvation of our souls. This surely is a wonderful matter. However, this also is mixed with Old Testament matters in James’ writing. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yv7JIgy5E5UniKhBpIGKqVxngTpyax1XzsMXiIaGaTDp7hbyHiYKUzjvYMoBjZGqP">KEEPING THE PERFECT LAW OF FREEDOM<br/>IN THE OLD TESTAMENT PRACTICE</h2><p data-content-id="8AlrVo_CLrTEK6_Dj76UZPAiF6mOaFZcB2eUD5nDRPaTPEwHuxOeahUY5IgbZDkrV"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100101" data-verses="James 1:25">1:25</span> James says, “But he who looks into the perfect law, the law of freedom, and continues in it, not having become a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in his doing.” The perfect law, the law of freedom, is an excellent thing. This is the law of life inscribed on our hearts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100102" data-verses="Hebrews 8:10">Heb. 8:10</span>), the moral standard of which corresponds to that of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens decreed by the Lord on the mount (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100103" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">Matt. 5—7</span>). Although the keeping of the perfect law of freedom is a very positive thing, James speaks of keeping this law in the Old Testament practice. This is indicated by what he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100104" data-verses="James 1:26">1:26</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100105" data-verses="James 1:27">27</span>: “If anyone thinks himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his own heart, this one’s religion is vain. Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this, to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, to keep oneself unspotted from the world.” Here we see that James charges the believers to keep the perfect law of freedom in relation to three things: bridling the tongue, visiting orphans and widows, and keeping oneself unspotted from the world. None of these is a crucial item in God’s New Testament economy. By this we see that James does not tell us to keep the perfect law <span class="pg" data-page-id="117" id="117">[117]</span> of freedom in the New Testament practice. Rather, by charging us to bridle our tongue, visit orphans and widows, and keep ourselves unspotted from the world, he is speaking of Old Testament practices. </p>

<p data-content-id="2mOVbM5hMqH0CSuhHRvzmBZHdOF53B6dm0hRKYyXXsOzuiG4_X7RfLJcyXkUQN1zK"> In this message we shall consider some other characteristics of a life that is not fully according to and for God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="uphS182OKDP7uqx2UEW_KvUe6PfVEiZGV7FMGxy8XHg5GYmRM3XGoYXCl-E69ihAh">MOVING AS THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS</h2><p data-content-id="fXmheRHcyZcCa98HUvsy0hVfC50kJ2jhdGIrjFl-viEyINrPmG0-ZFVt0I7h1x-dS"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100148" data-verses="James 4:15">4:15</span>, James would have us say, “If the Lord wills, we will both live and do this or that.” Many Christians are fond of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100149" data-verses="James 4:13-17">verses 13 through 17</span> of the book of James. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100150" data-verses="James 4:13">4:13</span> James indicates that we should not say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into this or that city and spend a year there, and do business and make a profit.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100151" data-verses="James 4:14">verse 14</span> James goes on to say, “You who do not know what your life will be tomorrow; for you are a vapor, appearing for a little while, and then disappearing.” Therefore, we should say, “If the Lord wills....” <span class="pg" data-page-id="124" id="124">[124]</span> However, this way of living is according to the way of the Old Testament saints. New Testament saints, on the contrary, should be led by the Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100152" data-verses="Romans 8:14">Romans 8:14</span> Paul says, “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.” To be led by the Spirit of God is very different from saying that we will do this or that “if the Lord wills.” New Testament saints are those who are led by the Spirit in their daily living. Suppose a brother says, “If the Lord so wills, I will love my wife,” or a sister says, “If the Lord so wills, I will be in subjection to my husband.” This is not the way of the New Testament. Someone who follows the Old Testament way might say, “If the Lord wills, I will go shopping tomorrow. But if the Lord does not so will, what can I do except stay home?” Instead of this, we all must learn in our living to be led by the Spirit. Day by day and even moment by moment, we should be led by the indwelling Spirit. </p>

He addresses this Epistle to the twelve tribes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100153" data-verses="James 1:1">1:1</span>) and even uses the term “synagogue” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100154" data-verses="James 2:2">2:2</span>) to indicate an assembling place for Jewish Christians. Then in a parenthetical section (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100155" data-verses="James 5:1-6">5:1-6</span>) James seems to speak to the rich class among the Jews in general. Therefore we say that here we have a mixture with the Jews of the Old Testament dispensation. </p>

However, in talking about awaiting the Lord’s coming back, James did not have the New Testament concept. <span class="pg" data-page-id="125" id="125">[125]</span> Instead, he uses the prophets as an example of longsuffering and Job as an example of endurance: “Take as an example, brothers, of suffering evil and of longsuffering, the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord. Behold, we count those blessed who endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very compassionate and full of pity.” </p>
<p data-content-id="iCOojXOyxqA-I1jMT0waL6QwWVTlHunjJ3KKahF8eEJoQMRJhwth8ID_92Ux8Ncvj"> James’ teaching concerning awaiting the Lord’s coming is much different from that of the Lord Jesus and the Apostle Paul. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100157" data-verses="Matthew 24:42">Matthew 24:42</span> the Lord says, “Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100158" data-verses="Matthew 24:44">Matthew 24:44</span> He says, “Therefore, you also, be ready, for the Son of Man comes in an hour that you think not.” Here we see that, regarding His coming, the Lord tells us to watch and be ready. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100159" data-verses="Luke 21:36">Luke 21:36</span> the Lord gives us this charge: “But be watchful, at every time beseeching.” Concerning the Lord’s coming, Paul also charges us to watch: “So then, let us not sleep as the rest, but let us watch and be sober” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100160" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:6">1 Thes. 5:6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="1KTwyQK4tHZ9rxJcEPNsVFcEk6rwZ7l0zNaOpQTEbh3mXt5ffmH8FCboj1fmIOmnW"> The prophets and saints of the Old Testament are far removed from us. Today, however, we have the Triune God within. The Old Testament prophets and saints may have had longsuffering and endurance, but today we have the indwelling Triune God to be our endurance and longsuffering as we await the coming of the Lord Jesus. </p>

<p data-content-id="TPbSm9yJ3rRwyvrez0pTbjRKkfVs4kW1qhdYl1eP-0GOCiFs_osAKvx9pORTanX1Y"> In his Epistle James speaks concerning the practice of the church life; however, this practice is in the way of mixture. The first practice related to the church life covered by James in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100161" data-verses="James 5:13-20">5:13-20</span> is that of praying for a sick believer by anointing him in the name of the Lord: “Is anyone among you weak? Let him call to him the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil in the name of the Lord” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100162" data-verses="James 5:14">v. 14</span>). We must admit that it is wonderful to pray for a sick brother and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. <span class="pg" data-page-id="126" id="126">[126]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="n7dJkkKWDa-cR2INo3Y9nlJyrFvgS2JQ6tN9l2G97X0fdPtNaqc2g74V2__VxhAkK">Praying in the Old Testament Way</h2><p data-content-id="6-DOGQYndO4Ie5_pwPmM1cwXIkYGGSmV2lepx9kxJSBKtVfImOmXImZqWVcUQowM6"> Although James says a good word concerning prayer in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100163" data-verses="James 5:14-16">5:14-16</span>, his way of praying is that of the Old Testament prophets. This is proved by the fact that he uses the prayer of Elijah as an example: “Elijah was a man of like feeling with us, and in prayer he prayed that it should not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100164" data-verses="James 5:17-18">vv. 17-18</span>). James says that Elijah prayed in a prayer. We may admire this prayer and think that it is excellent. Paul, however, does not speak like this. Rather, Paul tells us to pray always in spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100165" data-verses="Ephesians 6:18">Eph. 6:18</span>). To pray in spirit is much better, sweeter, and richer than to pray in a prayer. The latter is to pray in the Old Testament way; the former is to pray in the New Testament way. In the case of Elijah, the Lord gave him a particular prayer as a burden, and Elijah prayed that it would not rain. Hence, Elijah prayed in the prayer given to him by the Lord. But today we have the indwelling Spirit abiding in our spirit and interceding for us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100166" data-verses="Romans 8:26">Rom. 8:26</span>), and we do not need a special prayer or burden, for we can pray in our spirit unceasingly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100167" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:17">1 Thes. 5:17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="RBya5z1w6HjqYZwY36jeeghpdZeLJUEivbrUBYBEL86ebNlv-i0JxmyfhCgxDBChp"> If we do not have light from the Lord, we may highly appreciate what James says concerning prayer. But if we are enlightened by the Lord, we shall see that the way of prayer described by James is the Old Testament way. By this we see that James’ writing brings us away from the New Testament practice and back to the Old Testament practice. </p>
