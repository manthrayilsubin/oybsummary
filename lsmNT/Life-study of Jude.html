In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104917" data-verses="Jude 1:3">verse 3</span> Jude entreats us to “contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.” In this message we shall cover the first seven verses of this Epistle. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="OkhyFjGeg9tFQ5rFZx4KZTFGxClc_D1qOD_-Yp-s3DWrbx9hkIBgrKIxVR_oi-H3g">INTRODUCTION</h2><p data-content-id="459ClDMuPhTt1wjdUAhmMUdtyHjMc1PTyPZz504zzqpmuOyDl-5kkSvzWDQFBCyQ0"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104918" data-verses="Jude 1:1-2">Verses 1 and 2</span> are the introduction to the book of Jude. In these verses Jude says, “Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ: mercy to you and peace and love be multiplied.” Both Jude and James were brothers of the Lord Jesus in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104919" data-verses="Matthew 13:55">Matt. 13:55</span>). James was one of the apostles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104920" data-verses="Galatians 1:19">Gal. 1:19</span>) and one of the elders in Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104921" data-verses="Acts 15:2">Acts 15:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104922" data-verses="Acts 15:13">13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104923" data-verses="Acts 21:18">21:18</span>), reputed with Peter and John to be a pillar of the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104924" data-verses="Galatians 2:9">Gal. 2:9</span>). He also wrote the Epistle of James (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104925" data-verses="James 1:1">James 1:1</span>). Jude was not listed among the twelve, nor are we told that he was an elder in a church. Nevertheless, he wrote this Epistle, a short yet excellent book. </p>
<p data-content-id="on0v7rD3BWRPN68oJMh_4jdfPu9M2XM4IJMdSbB52YrcKG02ln5BOJ6MOD-59yv3N"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104926" data-verses="Jude 1:1">verse 1</span>, this book is addressed to “those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ.” The Greek word rendered “by” may also be translated “for.” “By” denotes the strength and means of keeping; “for” denotes the purpose and object of keeping. All the believers have been given to the Lord by the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104927" data-verses="John 17:6">John 17:6</span>), and they are being kept for Him and by Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="3mSeINmScX0JVYxvngCzeIQpKaxYJsmPvpV_5ZIhrpokNCuKSDrLV_POwn34fhtP1"> Many Bible teachers believe that this Epistle, like 1 and 2 Peter, was written to Jewish believers in Christ. In Jude’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> words, these believers were called, beloved in God the Father, and kept by Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="YMRlTLwyqhy8lz8yuqZRF8TYwysZ1jGYyR7QFrHfkNv1WAqANWRFzpUozWhphTLJw"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104928" data-verses="Jude 1:2">verse 2</span> Jude says, “Mercy to you and peace and love be multiplied.” The fact that mercy is mentioned instead of grace in this greeting may be due to the church’s degradation and apostasy (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104929" data-verses="Jude 1:21-22">vv. 21-22</span>). In 1 and 2 Timothy Paul includes God’s mercy in his opening greeting. God’s mercy reaches farther than His grace. In the degraded situation of the churches, God’s mercy is needed. </p>
<p data-content-id="EunHdXKv8QpLamiXzyitaYOoEh9un8bJza1ARrtnwm8pRVP2cz5MV5Sosvg0W8kiU"> As sinners, we were in a pitiful situation. But God’s mercy reached us and brought us out of that situation and qualified us to receive His grace. In principle, grace requires that we be in a somewhat good condition. However, because mercy reaches farther than grace, it is able to reach those who are in a most pitiful condition. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="DWX-7UUkArX1m4RKrvhiPcr19RkOie_L2v66Xpx3GRCSUCdPmiNeqyu_ZwVjG27WI">CONTENDING FOR THE FAITH</h2><p data-content-id="SbldCo0shQhUqbF2biLb9H1MseG6vCqB7j1AvpoNKrz1p4eF9ExeTaeTHfezEc1TR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104930" data-verses="Jude 1:3">Verse 3</span> says, “Beloved, using all diligence to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you, entreating you to contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.” Here Jude speaks of our common salvation. This is general salvation, which is common to and held by all believers, like the common faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104931" data-verses="Titus 1:4">Titus 1:4</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="gSFEpDJ3oJW-DLSA6bl8Z8BD93RsKUpi9kdGr2dcurkhmvW6FSB3yt1SBgJlM7fsX"> Some Christians misapply Jude’s word about contending for the faith. They think that to contend for the faith means to contend for matters such as baptism and foot washing. Some argue concerning head covering or about the kind of bread used in the Lord’s table. However, the faith in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104932" data-verses="Jude 1:3">verse 3</span> does not refer to such matters. </p>
<p data-content-id="enB6vQ7iZzIwUVG2BqojfjDZ95nor7FSJxDNImbu2gqdMLITCg_LjRRf9LswtmfaO"> The faith in this verse is not subjective; it is objective. It does not refer to our believing, but refers to our belief, to what we believe. The faith denotes the contents of the New Testament as our faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104933" data-verses="Acts 6:7">Acts 6:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104934" data-verses="1Timothy 1:19">1 Tim. 1:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104935" data-verses="1Timothy 3:9">3:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104936" data-verses="1Timothy 4:1">4:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104937" data-verses="1Timothy 5:8">5:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104938" data-verses="1Timothy 6:10">6:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104939" data-verses="1Timothy 6:21">21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104940" data-verses="2Timothy 2:18">2 Tim. 2:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104941" data-verses="2Timothy 3:8">3:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104942" data-verses="2Timothy 4:7">4:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104943" data-verses="Titus 1:13">Titus 1:13</span>), in which we believe for our common salvation. This faith, not any doctrine, has been delivered once for all to the saints. For this faith we should contend (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104944" data-verses="1Timothy 6:12">1 Tim. 6:12</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="5XTEG7-vMdS6BT-Y28ncifTWxq-eRd_ZhQCllNGRH6idB-A6dGTmUHW-HH1RzGhzQ"> In the Old Testament God gave Abraham a promise. <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> Later, through Moses God gave the law to the children of Israel. In the Gospel of John we are told that when the Lord Jesus came, grace came (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104945" data-verses="John 1:17">1:17</span>). Here we have three important matters: promise, law, and grace. Some Bible teachers speak of the dispensation of promise, the dispensation of law, and the dispensation of grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="NEuri2z4COA6EIPE1TKyN3DfJtG3ehR0NX1MvzLIrhOi-BhL0lfWWz2D0vJmKUMpz"> In order to understand the truth in the New Testament, we need to see that God first gave a promise to Abraham. We may say that this promise was on the “main track” of God’s dealing with man. But because of the ignorance and unbelief of God’s chosen people, it was necessary for God to give the law to the children of Israel. In the book of Galatians Paul likens the law to Hagar, Abraham’s concubine, not to Sarah, Abraham’s wife (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104946" data-verses="Galatians 4:21-25">Gal. 4:21-25</span>). This means that Hagar was a type, or prefigure, of the law. Hence, the position of the law is not that of the wife, but that of a concubine. Now in the New Testament God gives faith instead of the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="tiJQSCq4x1zkD0UMmBwR1iimhAQvP440wporNiyw3vWs09CST35PvLvmwFI9vpTGh"> With the faith given by God there is both a subjective side and an objective side. The subjective side concerns our believing, and the objective side concerns the things we believe. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104947" data-verses="Jude 1:3">verse 3</span> the faith does not denote our ability to believe; rather, it refers to what we believe. Hence, the faith refers to the contents of the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="hw3tDNeUqXWmEwZQ3drdsgCGqGljcuGtcCKrULyILI4Bv-f5uu5md16CvFTeQal86"> Peter tells us in his second Epistle that like precious faith has been allotted to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104948" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">2 Pet. 1:1</span>). This faith is subjective and refers to the faith that is within us. This differs from the faith in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104949" data-verses="Jude 1:3">Jude 3</span>, for the faith here is objective. </p>
<p data-content-id="UMeaGGhm-CdzuQlOOghC9UpAyh8Ezqx-PhHmUTSurOhNcfWojM7UMaQ16c6WuWpRu"> The faith in the objective sense is equal to the contents of God’s will given to us in the New Testament. The law includes the contents of the Ten Commandments and all the subordinate ordinances. The law was given in the Old Testament, but what God gives in the New Testament is the faith that includes all the items of God’s new will. This will even includes the Triune God. However, it does not include such matters as head covering, foot washing, or methods of baptism. Nevertheless, some believers contend for such things, thinking that they are contending for the faith. But that is <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> not the correct understanding of what Jude means by contending for the faith once for all delivered to the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="MxIdSJnTafVkc1IR_LjdQqszoSDwLJgjYPCIXMBjRxumVtPSWlhbSuUpXEMZY-URj"> To contend for the faith is to contend for the basic and crucial matters of God’s new will. One of these basic matters is Christ’s death for our redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="VQH674lSmpFZgN_5C4utPvlSDS1-GZlCLdMfc7RXzVdXilmkefLDcxHGQpfETOdkb"> Suppose a modernist tells you that Jesus died on the cross not for redemption, but because He was a martyr and sacrificed Himself for His teachings. This understanding of the death of Christ is heretical. It is contrary to one of the main items of God’s new will. We need to contend for the truth concerning Christ’s redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="iZ2C2dbJegrTdGRQfj7ZwUyGIXHf-jE9SzzbFIQvLDhZ83ywaytEhpF81tarOBW19"> Many years ago in China we contended for the truth of redemption when we fought against the book <em>For Sinners Only,</em> a book which claims that a sinner can be favored by God or saved apart from the blood of Jesus. The Bible clearly says that without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104950" data-verses="Hebrews 9:22">Heb. 9:22</span>). We fought against that heretical book and inoculated the believers against its modernistic teachings. </p>
<p data-content-id="1keDVYq1vXUmDPKGqQHREHl4QQhEu-4Q4JoojzU9BR5bcirNCnLn6CotajOWUKtfg"> We thank the Lord that in this country today many fundamental Bible teachers are also fighting against heretical, modernistic teachings. This is to contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints. This faith has been delivered to the saints once for all, and what we need to do now is to contend for it. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9w9UOPuLw9xETlXrM2sV-bika98BDfbzKKc1XsYnrPdG6bSMDxNkOixfQYVlS7zyr">THE HERESIES OF THE APOSTATES</h2><p data-content-id="j47ESgF05nPvh2jkAHA6Uv2e_XEbyYerfose0Dp_Lipg2nIdiS2DiRhTqMsa05OoM"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104951" data-verses="Jude 1:4">verse 4</span> Jude goes on to say, “For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who of old have been written of beforehand for this judgment, ungodly men, perverting the grace of our God into licentiousness, and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104952" data-verses="Jude 1:4-19">Verses 4 through 19</span> of Jude are in close parallel with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104953" data-verses="2Peter 2:1">chapter two</span> of 2 Peter. This indicates that the Epistle of Jude was written in the time of the church’s apostasy and degradation. </p>
<p data-content-id="TeEF8zPprmWpPC1Z4WGNz6x6YVixFX2sqAiSf8rUWBB1p6iJJgt6QLBPiXk3WlpZu"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104954" data-verses="Jude 1:4">verse 4</span> Jude says that certain men have “crept in unnoticed.” Literally the Greek means to get in by the side, or slip in by a side door. We may compare this with “secretly <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> bring in” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104955" data-verses="2Peter 2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>. As the enemy crept in to sow tares among the wheat (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104956" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matt. 13</span>), the apostates have crept in unnoticed. </p>
<p data-content-id="nSRDr1SKsg6N6M8SU-rrNCnPIH-SR8QEn_3ytxBoyVXqJCneQcb7cLDIVrpOfoCea"> The words “this judgment” refer to the judgment of the creeping in unnoticed of the apostates, the judgment unfolded in the following verses. Judgment here is the condemnation for punishment, and it refers to being condemned to be punished. </p>

Jude charges us to contend for the faith, and then he goes on to speak concerning apostasy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104976" data-verses="Jude 1:4">v. 4</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104977" data-verses="Jude 1:5-7">verses 5 through 7</span> he gives some historical examples of the Lord’s judgment upon apostasy. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104978" data-verses="Jude 1:8-19">verses 8 through 19</span> he points out the evils of the apostates and their punishment under the Lord’s judgment. Let us consider these verses one by one and pay attention to certain crucial points. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gSFEpDJ3oJW-DLSA6bV8evhD93RsKUpi9kdGr2dcurkhmvW6FSB3yt1SBgJlM7fsX">DESPISING LORDSHIP</h2><p data-content-id="enB6vQ7iZzIwUVG2BqYjZwzZ95nor7FSJxDNImbu2gqdMLITCg_LjRRf9LswtmfaO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104979" data-verses="Jude 1:8">Verse 8</span> says, “Yet in like manner these dreamers also defile the flesh and despise lordship and revile dignities.” The ungodly men spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104980" data-verses="Jude 1:4">verse 4</span> are dreamers, bearing the name of Christians yet doing things as in dreams, such things as perverting the grace of God into licentiousness to defile their flesh and denying Jesus Christ as our only Master and Lord, despising His lordship and reviling the authorities in His heavenly government. </p>
<p data-content-id="5XTEG7-vMdS6BT-Y28XcrMTWxq-eRd_ZhQCllNGRH6idB-A6dGTmUHW-HH1RzGhzQ"> According to what we have observed throughout the years, those who deny the Lord Jesus and refuse to believe the holy Word eventually cast off the feeling in their conscience. In Paul’s words, their conscience has been seared (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104981" data-verses="1Timothy 4:2">1 Tim. 4:2</span>) and does not function properly. As a result, they may become unclean and immoral. Once a person’s conscience has become seared, he no longer has a protection or safeguard. </p>
<p data-content-id="NEuri2z4COA6EIPE1T6yFkTfJtG3ehR0NX1MvzLIrhOi-BhL0lfWWz2D0vJmKUMpz"> The apostates defile the flesh, despise lordship, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> revile dignities because they do not care for God’s government. Having no regard for God’s authority, they are altogether lawless. They despise lordship; that is, they despise the lordship of Christ, which is the center of the divine government, dominion, and authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104982" data-verses="Acts 2:36">Acts 2:36</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104983" data-verses="Ephesians 1:21">Eph. 1:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104984" data-verses="Colossians 1:16">Col. 1:16</span>). They also revile dignities, which probably refer to both angels and men in power and authority. </p>
<p data-content-id="fATzyTlsoP_9RH3Yv_tZu0wiS4ciRyveJYshfUP5xF1xEkJGFr0bA1B_ecmSszMCC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104985" data-verses="Jude 1:9">verse 9</span> Jude continues, “But Michael the archangel, when disputing with the Devil, arguing concerning the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him, but said, The Lord rebuke you.” The body of Moses was buried by the Lord in a valley in the land of Moab, in a place known by no man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104986" data-verses="Deuteronomy 34:6">Deut. 34:6</span>). It must have been purposely done in this manner by the Lord. When Moses and Elijah appeared with Christ on the mount of transfiguration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104987" data-verses="Matthew 17:3">Matt. 17:3</span>), Moses must have been manifested in his body, which was kept by the Lord and resurrected. Probably, in view of this, the Devil attempted to do something to his body, and the archangel argued with him concerning this. The reference in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104988" data-verses="2Peter 2:11">2 Peter 2:11</span> is general, but this is a definite case, concerning the body of Moses. </p>
<p data-content-id="Iytig6kX1qPmTVyXqAj3huA5EeRwkydDn3QJ0HLKzjHoLK4fBru0-ZFb2yYHmUtCu"> Jude points out that Michael did not bring a reviling judgment against the Devil, but said, “The Lord rebuke you.” This indicates that, in the Lord’s heavenly government, the Devil, Satan, was even higher than the archangel Michael. God appointed and set him so (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104989" data-verses="Ezekiel 28:14">Ezek. 28:14</span>). In any case, Satan was under the Lord. Therefore, Michael said to him, “The Lord rebuke you.” Michael kept his position in the order of divine authority. </p>

In Greek the word “know” here denotes a deeper sensing of invisible things, and the word for “understand” denotes a superficial realization of visible objects. We <span class="pg" data-page-id="11" id="11">[11]</span> need both an understanding of visible things and a knowing of invisible things. </p>
<p data-content-id="krpMeeWEM0lebZkKLX9sP9N5zcKkxNrusw-_WsxcMDsnW2mcvEEmhvz88-l6Mj_Cw"> The Greek word rendered “naturally” also means instinctively. These dreamers revile what they do not know, things which they should know; and what they understand they understand naturally, instinctively, without reason, as animals of instinct. They do not exercise the deeper and higher knowledge of man with reason, including the consciousness of man’s conscience. What they practice is the shallow and base instinctive understanding, like that of animals without human reason. By behaving this way they are being corrupted or destroyed. </p>

Because they have gone in the way of Cain, and poured themselves out in the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the rebellion of Korah.” Here Jude refers to the way of Cain, the error of Balaam, and the rebellion of Korah. The way of Cain is the way of serving God religiously after one’s own will and rejecting heretically the redemption by blood required and ordained by God. Those who follow the way of Cain are according to the flesh and envy God’s true people because of their faithful testimony to God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104994" data-verses="Genesis 4:2-8">Gen. 4:2-8</span>). </p>

Because they like to do things a certain way, they do them that way. This is to serve God religiously after one’s own will. </p>
<p data-content-id="bw2zloIScym__6DoLqmMA5OtiYSeilTv-lOT7vP-3bnXpfwaXUDp-U21-ZHm56YW3"> We have pointed out that Cain rejected redemption by blood as required by God, and he was also envious of his brother, Abel. Abel was a true child of God, and his testimony was faithful to God and accepted by Him. God was pleased with Abel’s offering. But Cain envied his brother to such an extent that he killed him. In principle, this has happened throughout the last nineteen centuries. The ones accepted by God suffer at the hands of those who serve God religiously according to their own will. <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="qZCTitEfIVPlSaX-cwRHjrjQyD9UUAntd1Lzhmq1Rk56e01chdu46d15lbq6p4DaC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104995" data-verses="Jude 1:11">verse 11</span> Jude says that the apostates have “poured themselves out in the error of Balaam for reward.” For the apostates to pour themselves out in this way means that they gave themselves up to this error, rushed headlong into it, ran riotously into it. </p>
<p data-content-id="yYI-SZJxPOfxgrVUXCKwWBGWztF_XHMNltUe2kVkEjjMl_Ntll9KdzMGf4f6CcKRf"> The error of Balaam is the error of teaching wrong doctrine for reward, although the one teaching knows that it is contrary to the truth and against the people of God. The error of Balaam also involves abusing the influence of certain gifts to lead the people of God astray from the pure worship of the Lord to idolatrous worship (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104996" data-verses="Numbers 22:7">Num. 22:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104997" data-verses="Numbers 22:21">21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104998" data-verses="Numbers 31:16">31:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104999" data-verses="Revelation 2:14">Rev. 2:14</span>). Balaam knew that what he taught was against God’s truth and against His people, and he knowingly taught it for gain. </p>
<p data-content-id="8WAepsPtr6a-aGayLeivi2hYCoWcqsAgYxS_insE2knpz2J8pHCqkn8E_vzcrsFbl"> Today certain Bible teachers and preachers have fallen into the error of Balaam. Some of these know the deeper truths of the Word. However, fearing the loss of financial support, they do not dare to teach these truths. For example, in 1963 I had a pleasant fellowship with a particular preacher. He told me that he knew the truth concerning the church. But he said that he could not teach this truth, because if he did so, his organization would lose financial support. This indicates that he taught only those things that would enable him to receive financial support. At least to some extent, he practiced the error of Balaam. </p>
<p data-content-id="0Drze_ogdaYsISIhxsITiOpoBhdoKRnW4zCAIeipgskqxgczYqIx0WMOUhkTtIcWy"> If we know the truth, we should teach it and preach it at any cost. But if we dare not teach and preach the truth because we fear loss or because we desire financial gain, we are practicing the error of Balaam. What a shame that certain preachers do not preach the truth because they fear the loss of financial support! In principle, this is the error of Balaam. </p>
<p data-content-id="7vhSxW06IYbMGuRABnMrhAdFoSrjnBLATWkvUnNbS9FQMj5GKQOLscWcfc6lJcAqB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105000" data-verses="Jude 1:11">verse 11</span> Jude also speaks of those who perished in the rebellion of Korah. The Greek word translated “rebellion” here literally means contradiction, speaking against. The rebellion of Korah was a rebellion against God’s deputy authority in His government and His word spoken by His <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> deputy (like Moses). This brings in destruction (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105001" data-verses="Numbers 16:1-40">Num. 16:1-40</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="_PEe0ySTefP4s3le4ottBFiDZl6uUJc2pn7vSGk96IXOkV4TXuWQriok0edQsLtq8"> Moses was God’s deputy in authority and also in the speaking of His word. But Korah and two hundred fifty others rebelled against Moses’ authority and speaking. Actually, this authority and speaking were of God, not of Moses. Moses’ authority was God’s authority, and his speaking was God’s speaking. Nevertheless, Korah and his group rebelled against this. As a result, Korah and those with him suffered a serious judgment: the earth opened and swallowed them all. </p>
<p data-content-id="BBMa8EL2HD-lJwlzctKjtY9NnAd5k1EugAHeffNJHAV2ra7cjqd5BT5wTsrOQC73I"> We know from history that God always speaks through a deputy authority. To rebel against this authority and speaking is, in principle, to be in the rebellion of Korah. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105035" data-verses="Jude 1:20-21">verses 20 and 21</span> he charges the believers to build themselves up in the holy faith and to live in the Triune God. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105036" data-verses="Jude 1:22-23">verses 22 and 23</span> he charges the believers to care for others with mercy in fear. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1keDVYq1vXUmDPKGqQnRAUF4QQhEu-4Q4JoojzU9BR5bcirNCnLn6CotajOWUKtfg">BUILDING OURSELVES UP<br/>IN OUR MOST HOLY FAITH</h2><p data-content-id="9w9UOPuLw9xETlXrM2MV7ISka98BDfbzKKc1XsYnrPdG6bSMDxNkOixfQYVlS7zyr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105037" data-verses="Jude 1:20">verse 20</span> Jude says, “But you, beloved, building up yourselves in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.” The faith here is objective faith and refers to the precious things of the New Testament in which we believe for our salvation in Christ. On the foundation of this holy faith and in the sphere of it, through praying in the Holy Spirit, we build up ourselves. The truth of the faith in our apprehension and the Holy Spirit through our prayer are necessary for our building up. Both the faith and the Spirit are holy. </p>
<p data-content-id="j47ESgF05nPvh2jkAHg6e82e_XEbyYerfose0Dp_Lipg2nIdiS2DiRhTqMsa05OoM"> It is correct to say that faith in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105038" data-verses="Jude 1:20">verse 20</span> is objective faith. However, we need to realize that this objective faith produces subjective faith. Faith first refers to the truth contained in the Word of God and conveyed by the Word. The written word of God in the Bible and the spoken word in the genuine and proper preaching and teaching contain the truth and convey the truth to us. By truth we mean the reality of what God is, the reality of the process through which God has passed, and the reality of what He has accomplished, attained, and obtained. Hence, truth as reality includes all the facts concerning what God is, what God has passed <span class="pg" data-page-id="18" id="18">[18]</span> through, what God has accomplished, and what God has attained and obtained. All this is revealed in the New Testament. We may read about this in the Bible, or we may hear it through someone’s preaching and teaching. But in either case this reality is contained in the holy Word and conveyed by the Word to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="TeEF8zPprmWpPC1Z4WmN4ph6YVixFX2sqAiSf8rUWBB1p6iJJgt6QLBPiXk3WlpZu"> As we listen to the word that contains the truth, the Spirit of Christ works within us. The Spirit of Christ always works according to the Word and with the Word. This means that the Spirit of Christ cooperates with the Word. As a result of this cooperation, eventually in our experience there is a “click,” like that made by the shutter of a camera, and the “scene” of what is contained in the Word is impressed on our spirit and becomes our faith. As we pointed out in the Life-study of 2 Peter, this is the faith allotted to us as our portion from God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105039" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">2 Pet. 1:1</span>), and this portion is nothing less than the New Testament inheritance. </p>
<p data-content-id="tiJQSCq4x1zkD0UMmBQR1gimhAQvP440wporNiyw3vWs09CST35PvLvmwFI9vpTGh"> This faith is both objective and subjective. As we build ourselves up in our most holy faith, we build ourselves up in a faith that is not only objective but especially subjective. The subjective faith comes out of the objective faith. In other words, faith implies both what we believe in and also our believing. This is the most holy faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="hw3tDNeUqXWmEwZQ3dLdsiCGqGljcuGtcCKrULyILI4Bv-f5uu5md16CvFTeQal86"> This faith is not something of ourselves. In ourselves we do not have such a faith. The most holy faith is a great blessing given to us from God, of God, and even with God. When this faith comes into us, it comes with God, with all that God is, with all that God has passed through, with all that God has accomplished in Christ and through the Spirit, and with all that God has obtained and attained. All this comes into us with God in this faith. As long as we have this faith, we have the processed God, redemption, regeneration, the divine life, and all things related to life and godliness. We are also positioned and privileged to partake of the divine nature and enjoy it. Therefore, once we have this faith, we have everything. Now we need to build ourselves up in this holy faith. <span class="pg" data-page-id="19" id="19">[19]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="UMeaGGhm-CdzuQlOOgBC-UJAyh8Ezqx-PhHmUTSurOhNcfWojM7UMaQ16c6WuWpRu"> With what materials do we build ourselves up in our holy faith? The answer is that this faith is both the materials with which we build and also the base or foundation on which we build. If we do not have faith, we do not have the materials, and we do not have the base, the foundation, on which to build. This means that without faith we have nothing to build on and nothing to build with. As believers, we build ourselves up with the content of our most holy faith, and we build ourselves up on this faith as a foundation. Praise the Lord that we have such a faith! </p>
<p data-content-id="MxIdSJnTafVkc1IR_LDdTqMzoSDwLJgjYPCIXMBjRxumVtPSWlhbSuUpXEMZY-URj"> The Chinese version of the Bible translates the Greek word for faith in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105040" data-verses="Jude 1:20">verse 20</span> with a word that means “the true word.” Faith in this verse surely implies the true word, for faith is produced out of the contents of the true word, God’s revelation. The word of God’s revelation contains the divine reality of God’s being, process, redemptive work, accomplishment, and attainment, and this word conveys all this divine reality into us. When we hear the words concerning this reality, the Holy Spirit works within us in a way that corresponds to these words. The outcome is faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="VQH674lSmpFZgN_5C4OtMuFSDS1-GZlCLdMfc7RXzVdXilmkefLDcxHGQpfETOdkb"> Although faith implies the true word, it implies much more than this. According to the New Testament, faith is all-inclusive. As long as we have faith, we have all the divine things. Therefore, with these divine things as the material and foundation, we may build ourselves up in our most holy faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="iZ2C2dbJegrTdGRQfjbZzVSGIXHf-jE9SzzbFIQvLDhZ83ywaytEhpF81tarOBW19"> To build ourselves up in the faith does not mean to build ourselves up with theological doctrines or biblical knowledge. Mere doctrine or knowledge is too objective and also empty. But truth as the reality of the holy Word is not empty. This truth is the content of the most holy faith. Therefore, with this content we have something real and solid with which and on which to build. </p>
<p data-content-id="1keDVYq1vXUmDPKGqQnRHHF4QQhEu-4Q4JoojzU9BR5bcirNCnLn6CotajOWUKtfg"> The building up in the most holy faith is not individualistic; rather, this building is a corporate matter. Jude is speaking to the believers corporately when he charges them to build up themselves in their most holy faith. If we would build up ourselves in the faith, we must do it in a corporate <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> way; that is, we must do it in the Body, in the church life. Apart from the church life, we cannot build ourselves up in the faith. Outside the church life, there is not such a building. Actually, to build up ourselves in the most holy faith is to build up the Body of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9w9UOPuLw9xETlXrM2MV9bCka98BDfbzKKc1XsYnrPdG6bSMDxNkOixfQYVlS7zyr">PRAYING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="j47ESgF05nPvh2jkAHg6XsWe_XEbyYerfose0Dp_Lipg2nIdiS2DiRhTqMsa05OoM"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105041" data-verses="Jude 1:20">verse 20</span>, if we would build up ourselves in our most holy faith, we need to pray in the Holy Spirit. Faith is related to the Word, and in the Holy Spirit we have life. In this verse the Holy Spirit mainly refers to life, not to power. However, some Christians today understand the Holy Spirit mainly in terms of power. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105042" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Romans 8:2</span> Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of life. From experience we know that praying in the Holy Spirit is much more a matter of life than a matter of power. When we pray we may not sense power; however, we often have the sense of life. Life is more precious than power. </p>
<p data-content-id="TeEF8zPprmWpPC1Z4WmNw5R6YVixFX2sqAiSf8rUWBB1p6iJJgt6QLBPiXk3WlpZu"> Regarding praying in the Holy Spirit, Pentecostal people may relate this more to power than to life because their emphasis is on power instead of on life. There is a great difference between emphasizing life and emphasizing power. Actually, real spiritual power comes from spiritual life. </p>
<p data-content-id="nSRDr1SKsg6N6M8SU-LrNAnPIH-SR8QEn_3ytxBoyVXqJCneQcb7cLDIVrpOfoCea"> Genuine power is a matter of life. We may use seeds as an illustration. Seeds of every kind are small. I have never seen a seed as large as a baseball. But although a seed is small, it is dynamic and full of life. Because a seed is full of life, it is powerful. After you sow a seed in the ground, it sprouts and grows into a plant or tree. Although the sprouts may be very tender, they have the power to break through the soil. This power comes from the life in the seed. In a similar way, building ourselves up by praying in the Holy Spirit is mainly a matter of life. </p>

<p data-content-id="mPjRGKJMALwGYmO1KZP0V5aUgLq9oyCrwrhDIObbKpAOrrxn7RZE4XO8OO5SzGFZh"> In this message I would like to give a further word concerning the central thought of the Epistles of Peter and Jude. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZNcvZwkRJGAhnQALVzHuiUHc50Z_otGzMi_6WaUte4kUEsJwyxJ-r_mfPR1UBAOIp"> It is very surprising, even astounding, that an uneducated fisherman from Galilee such as Peter could write the two Epistles of 1 and 2 Peter. In his writings Peter embraces all the matters of God’s eternal economy, the same matters that Paul covers in his Epistles. Paul, of course, was highly educated. He had been trained in the Scriptures of the Old Testament, and he also had been educated in Greek and Roman culture. Peter, however, did not have this learning. Nevertheless, he wrote his two Epistles in a marvelous way. </p>
<p data-content-id="AUFy5rmsdb-BWlyC1jOJD57LQZGPD_YQ9RuTIuasXVLl15u7zYAihvlQIohzgNqb0"> Peter even used certain terms and expressions that Paul did not use. For example, Peter speaks about being partakers of the divine nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105074" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Pet. 1:4</span>). This profound expression cannot be found in the writings of Paul. Not only does Peter use deep and profound expressions, but in his Epistles he also covers a number of significant details. In quantity Peter wrote much less than Paul wrote, but in certain points he may be richer than Paul. Therefore, we need to spend adequate time to study the two Epistles of Peter to see the crucial points and the details. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="F3J9Rs1dD-SNEs6NtR23miFnf9C_ELqe_xJ44cL2NKDXvBeW9IM_BNmJ1ZURw0rnD">THE TRIUNE GOD AS OUR PORTION</h2><p data-content-id="bw2zloIScym__6DoLrGMA7OtiYSeilTv-lOT7vP-3bnXpfwaXUDp-U21-ZHm56YW3"> The first basic matter covered by Peter in his writings is <span class="pg" data-page-id="26" id="26">[26]</span> the Triune God. Peter indicates that the God in whom we believe is the Triune God. In the opening words of Peter’s first Epistle we can see the Triune God: “According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105075" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">v. 2</span>). Here we have the foreknowledge of God the Father, the sanctification of the Spirit, and the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. God the Father has regenerated us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105076" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>), Christ has accomplished redemption with His precious blood, and the Spirit applies God’s full salvation to His chosen people. Here we see the Triune God in the accomplishment of full salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="qZCTitEfIVPlSaX-cxxHjpjQyD9UUAntd1Lzhmq1Rk56e01chdu46d15lbq6p4DaC"> Peter also unveils to us the fact that this Triune God is our portion. This fact is indicated by the word “partakers” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105077" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span>. According to this verse, we have become partakers of the divine nature. This indicates that the Triune God is now our portion. If God were not our portion, we could not partake of His nature. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yYI-SZJxPOfxgrVUXDqwVBmWztF_XHMNltUe2kVkEjjMl_Ntll9KdzMGf4f6CcKRf">THE MEANS FOR US TO PARTAKE OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="8WAepsPtr6a-aGayLfCvh2BYCoWcqsAgYxS_insE2knpz2J8pHCqkn8E_vzcrsFbl"> In his writings Peter also reveals the way for us to partake of the Triune God as our portion. The way involves the hidden man of the heart, and this hidden man is our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105078" data-verses="1Peter 3:4">1 Pet. 3:4</span>). In his Epistles Paul has much to say concerning our spirit, but he does not use the expression “the hidden man of the heart.” This hidden man, our human spirit, is the means by which we enjoy the Triune God as our portion. </p>
<p data-content-id="0Drze_ogdaYsISIhxtoThPJoBhdoKRnW4zCAIeipgskqxgczYqIx0WMOUhkTtIcWy"> Although Peter speaks of God’s Spirit only a few times, his terminology is marvelous. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105079" data-verses="1Peter 4:14">1 Peter 4:14</span> he says, “If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.” Literally, the Greek here means “the Spirit of glory and that of God.” The Spirit of glory is the Spirit of God. Peter also speaks concerning the Spirit of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105080" data-verses="1Peter 1:11">1 Pet. 1:11</span>). Our human spirit as the hidden man of the heart and God’s Spirit as the Spirit of glory and as the Spirit of Christ are the means for us to partake of God as our portion. <span class="pg" data-page-id="27" id="27">[27]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7vhSxW06IYbMGuRABmsriB9FoSrjnBLATWkvUnNbS9FQMj5GKQOLscWcfc6lJcAqB">THE TRIUNE GOD PROCESSED<br/>TO BECOME OUR ENJOYMENT</h2><p data-content-id="_PEe0ySTefP4s3le4pNtCFCDZl6uUJc2pn7vSGk96IXOkV4TXuWQriok0edQsLtq8"> We have pointed out that the Epistles of Peter are on the subject of God’s government, in particular on God’s governmental dealings through judgment. This is the central subject of these two books. Nevertheless, the structure of 1 and 2 Peter is the Triune God, who has been processed to become our portion so that we may participate in Him, partake of Him, and enjoy Him through His Spirit, who is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of glory, and by the exercise of our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="BBMa8EL2HD-lJwlzcsqjuYdNnAd5k1EugAHeffNJHAV2ra7cjqd5BT5wTsrOQC73I"> I encourage you to study all the details in the Epistles of Peter. However, as you study these details, do not be distracted from the central thought and the basic structure of God’s holy writings in general and the Epistles of Peter in particular. The basic structure is the Triune God who has been processed to become our all-inclusive portion. We enjoy Him by exercising our spirit to cooperate with and respond to the divine Spirit. We should never forget this basic structure or be distracted from it. If we hold firmly to the basic thought and the basic structure as we study all the other points in the writings of Peter, we shall be enriched and we shall experience the Triune God in a very rich, absolute, and detailed way. </p>
<p data-content-id="xBUUOlew5Eg4_IEIkmuY5GjAivQ5-xKarV4wd4JJr6DMpdADzdX40i3YiQUJVPSV9"> The three Epistles of 1 and 2 Peter and Jude cover many points. But the basic structure of these Epistles is the Triune God operating on His elect that they may be brought into the full enjoyment of the Triune God. Both Peter and Jude indicate strongly that the Triune God has passed through a process in order to do many things for us and to become everything to us that we may partake of Him for our enjoyment. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="r1n-Nom6nn2gcc8emsnwV_uNwg_a852kXqGS8hh4ALp7oNCALgAGerHeY9gnm8t5j">THE TRIUNE GOD BECOMING OUR GRACE</h2><p data-content-id="dgRwKEJMjoBgTWGS4iHAgnQ1HlxPx4lwKQ_3nG_kaNIUqi-t5YPBYMnM-u9Co_8Ov"> Peter begins his first Epistle with a word concerning the threefold operation of the Triune God upon His chosen people to bring them into the participation and enjoyment of Himself. At the beginning of his second Epistle Peter speaks <span class="pg" data-page-id="28" id="28">[28]</span> concerning the divine provision. He tells us that the divine power has granted us and even imparted to us all things related to life and godliness in order that we may partake of the divine nature. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105081" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">chapter one</span> of 2 Peter, the divine provision gives us not only the divine life but also the divine light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105082" data-verses="2Peter 1:19">v. 19</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="QuniR3vflIV2GiYQ-AIGLDWIDeOb82Z-sBmx_GMnT9NiZPkTewfxWeaDmeAbIDTwo"> At the end of his first Epistle Peter says, “But the God of all grace, who called you into His eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105083" data-verses="1Peter 5:10">5:10</span>). Here Peter indicates that we shall be grounded in God Himself. Then at the end of his second Epistle Peter says, “But grow in grace and the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105084" data-verses="2Peter 3:18">3:18</span>). Here the knowledge of our Lord is equal to the truth, the reality of all that He is. Therefore, in this verse Peter charges us to grow in grace and in truth, reality. Although Peter covers many matters in his Epistles, the basic structure of his writings is the Triune God becoming our grace that we may enjoy Him, grow in life, and through the growth in life be perfected, established, strengthened, and grounded in the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="KCdZK6ky1UoyC3ImpB9Oes0PsEIMMiUaQuu9bbiw8H4Nr6QM3g6xaA4eyXEggv_7q"> As we study the details of the Epistles of Peter and Jude, we need to remember that all the detailed points help us to solve our problems so that we may be brought back to the enjoyment of the Triune God. Therefore, we should not consider the details in a detached way. Every point is a help in solving our problems so that we would not be distracted further from the enjoyment of the Triune God, but instead be brought back to this enjoyment. </p>

We have seen that the faith is the New Testament inheritance substantiated to <span class="pg" data-page-id="29" id="29">[29]</span> us and realized by us. We pointed out in the Life-study of 2 Peter that this inheritance is actually the Triune God processed to be our portion. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="u6VN4cpJk0rvWyqZMLA7WHyOiCLZZfcAdisEoGh6XEa6p6vwPHJaWRe-QrxsuOgOz">THE OPERATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="fATzyTlsoP_9RH3Yv-dZnmQiS4ciRyveJYshfUP5xF1xEkJGFr0bA1B_ecmSszMCC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105108" data-verses="1Peter 1:2-3">1 Peter 1:2 and 3</span> we can see the operation of the Triune God: “According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead.” In these verses we have the foreknowledge of God the Father, the sanctification of the Spirit, and the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. Here we have the Triune God the Father, the Spirit, and Jesus Christ, the Son. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105109" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">verse 3</span> Peter also tells us that the Father has regenerated us unto a living hope through Christ’s resurrection. Here again we see the Father’s operation. The Father not only chose us in eternity, but in time He also regenerated us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105110" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">verse 2</span> Peter says that the Spirit sanctifies us, applying to us what the Father decided concerning us in eternity past. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105111" data-verses="1Peter 1:11">verse 11</span> Peter speaks concerning the witness of the Spirit of Christ in the prophets of the Old Testament. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105112" data-verses="1Peter 1:18-19">verses 18 and 19</span> Peter says, “Knowing that you were redeemed not with <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ.” Now that we have been redeemed with Christ’s precious blood, we need to have our souls purified by obedience to the truth unto unfeigned brotherly love (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105113" data-verses="1Peter 1:22">v. 22</span>). This purification of the soul is based upon the Father’s regeneration. We have been regenerated by the Father with an incorruptible seed, a seed that is the living and abiding word of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105114" data-verses="1Peter 1:23">v. 23</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Iytig6kX1qPmTVyXqBT3p8w5EeRwkydDn3QJ0HLKzjHoLK4fBru0-ZFb2yYHmUtCu"> As we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105115" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">chapter one</span> of 1 Peter as a whole, we can see that this chapter reveals the operation of the Triune God. Here we have the Father’s regeneration, the Spirit’s sanctification, the blood of Christ, the incorruptible seed, the living hope, and also the inheritance kept for us in the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105116" data-verses="1Peter 1:4">v. 4</span>). In this chapter we have not only the basic structure of the first Epistle of Peter, but we also have the basic structure of our Christian life. The Christian life is constructed of all the items related to the operation of the Triune God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="j47ESgF05nPvh2jkAGA6XuWe_XEbyYerfose0Dp_Lipg2nIdiS2DiRhTqMsa05OoM">THE TWO TREES</h2><p data-content-id="TeEF8zPprmWpPC1Z4XGNw7R6YVixFX2sqAiSf8rUWBB1p6iJJgt6QLBPiXk3WlpZu"> The basic structure of the Christian life revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105117" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">1 Peter 1</span> is something far different from our natural concept. In our natural mind we do not have the kind of thought presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105118" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">1 Peter 1</span>. Our natural thought is to do good, to love others, to worship God, and to work for God. This concept is religious and traditional. </p>
<p data-content-id="nSRDr1SKsg6N6M8SU_rrOAHPIH-SR8QEn_3ytxBoyVXqJCneQcb7cLDIVrpOfoCea"> A person who is far from God may not care for God at all. But once such a person repents and begins to care for God, he will immediately have the desire to do good in order to glorify God. He will also have the desire to be more considerate of others. He may even decide to give a tenth of his income to the Lord. Although these things are good, they are religious, traditional, and natural. </p>
<p data-content-id="6Q0CRVywJ0NHPzORIW7gJ9oyJeatMcwvLUgupr8R5O4wZwcZgRhE78--n8M3DE-No"> You may have heard many messages telling you that the Triune God has been processed to become the life-giving Spirit in order to be everything to you. But in your daily life <span class="pg" data-page-id="35" id="35">[35]</span> you may not care for the processed Triune God. Instead, you may try to be a good husband or wife and a good parent. In your effort to improve yourself, you may not have the realization that you are not living the Triune God, that you are not one with the life-giving Spirit. Instead of putting into practice the word concerning being one spirit with the Lord in your daily living, your desire may be to be victorious or to improve yourself. </p>
<p data-content-id="RASR1QwGkmM8jynMF8JjpxO6AUc0p5gSpyw8icZdB3jsYngpRFNofXbZtilJd1Bdf"> The reason we fail to put into practice what we have heard is related to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In our fallen being there is the tendency toward this tree. The thought of doing good belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Before you repented and believed in the Lord, you may have had the knowledge of evil. But now that you are a believer, you may turn to the knowledge of good. However, the knowledge of both good and evil are of the same tree. </p>
<p data-content-id="sow98ChHigSdfsLLqJ-OOKVanTFK2FNWw-4aSxMgJBHopucre5C2odBBhQvX0mJ1P"> Throughout my years in the ministry, I have come to realize that although the saints may listen to messages on the Triune God as life, in their daily living they care for the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. But whenever we come back to the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit, we are immediately feeding on the tree of life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wlE4AOCPI_zFtNnZkN48kOiwLA5IFs15Vx64etz1pXwQ_BbnabjkbNodiwgD1rGxV">TWO SOURCES</h2><p data-content-id="LjgdodbW1RJv3DOnvgYtEHY5mD6sz8wk5AgPCKbw-hDCjDLPtvLK885PyzSDFQj6c"> There are only two sources in this universe—God and Satan. After God created man, He placed him in front of two trees signifying these two sources. God is signified by the tree of life, and Satan is signified by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God is the source of life. If we contact Him, we contact life. Satan is the source of death. If we contact him, we contact death. Therefore, God clearly told Adam not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for the result of eating that tree is death. God’s intention was that man would contact Him in order to receive life. If we contact the tree of knowledge instead of the tree of life, we shall contact death. God’s intention is that man would <span class="pg" data-page-id="36" id="36">[36]</span> contact Him to receive life. But in the fall Adam turned to Satan, the other source. </p>
<p data-content-id="mPjRGKJMALwGYmO1KZf0Sp6UgLq9oyCrwrhDIObbKpAOrrxn7RZE4XO8OO5SzGFZh"> Satan is not honest or straightforward. Rather, Satan wears a cloak and pretends to be something he is not. For example, when he first appeared to Adam, he appeared in the form of a serpent. Satan lurks behind the knowledge of good and evil. The result of the knowledge of either good or evil is death. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZNcvZwkRJGAhnQALVzXukE3c50Z_otGzMi_6WaUte4kUEsJwyxJ-r_mfPR1UBAOIp"> Today unbelievers and many times believers as well are under death because they daily contact the good aspect of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In religion, people are taught to know what is good and what is evil, and to do good and stay away from evil. This kind of teaching is common among Christians today. However, this teaching is natural and religious, and according to our fallen nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="AUFy5rmsdb-BWlyC1jeJJrbLQZGPD_YQ9RuTIuasXVLl15u7zYAihvlQIohzgNqb0"> In the Bible we have two sources, two lines, and two results. First we have the tree of life, the line of life, and the New Jerusalem. The tree of life will be found in the New Jerusalem. Without the tree of life, the New Jerusalem would not have any enjoyment. The unique enjoyment in the New Jerusalem will be the tree of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="F3J9Rs1dD-SNEs6NtRm3tw1nf9C_ELqe_xJ44cL2NKDXvBeW9IM_BNmJ1ZURw0rnD"> Then in the Bible we have the second source and the second line: the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the line of death. The result of this source and line is the lake of fire. </p>
<p data-content-id="CR2ZpWPx7FiGppaXbuXmXygje_w_7SL54crmVb9d8dRl_7DI54Wp04ms52fRyVM-L"> We need to have our eyes opened to see the tree of life in the Bible. Many Christians read the Bible, but they cannot see the tree of life. Because this is mysterious, unless our eyes are opened we shall not be able to see it. </p>
<p data-content-id="PCg7nDxiIPVJe6QD8ynk2VzETyas-E_56kfLcRDnN7Ohb_raXB6W_TM5r3f_3q74w"> The crucial point in what we have been saying concerning the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is that the structure of the Christian life as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105119" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">chapter one</span> of 1 Peter is very different from our natural concept, which is according to the knowledge of good and evil. I am very happy to see that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105120" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">1 Peter 1</span>, the basic structure of this Epistle, and of the entire Christian life, is the Triune God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="37" id="37">[37]</span> </p>
