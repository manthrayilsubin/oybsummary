## Summary of the Translator's Preface and Foreword to *The Star of Redemption*

**Translator's Preface**

* **The Task of Translation:**
    * Rosenzweig's work is highly poetic and intricate, requiring a translation that preserves its rhythm and nuances while clarifying ambiguities.
    * The translator aims to be faithful to the original while making it accessible to a modern English audience.
    * The goal is to "Americanize" the work, allowing it to resonate with new readers.
* **Challenges and Strategies:**
    * Rosenzweig's work is rich in citations and allusions requiring glosses for modern readers.
    * His language is dense with figures of speech and plays on words, which the translator strives to reproduce.
    * The translator attempts to maintain consistency in word choice, using identical English words for identical German words whenever possible.
    * Unusual German words and forms are rendered into equally conspicuous English equivalents, even if it results in neologisms.

**Foreword**

**I.  Background:**

* **Franz Rosenzweig's Life:**
    * Born into an assimilated Jewish family in 1886.
    * Early academic success in history and philosophy, particularly Hegelian thought.
    * Underwent a personal crisis in 1913, leading him to question his academic pursuits and explore his Jewish heritage.
* **The Turning Point of 1913:**
    * Rosenzweig's crisis stemmed from a personal need for meaning rather than purely intellectual dissatisfaction.
    * He found academic scholarship inadequate to answer his existential questions about self and life's purpose.
* **Rosenzweig's Return to Judaism:**
    * He initially considered converting to Christianity, influenced by friends and his own search for faith.
    * A transformative experience during Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) in 1913 led him back to Judaism.
    * Rosenzweig rediscovered the reality of God and the depth of Jewish tradition through this experience.

**II. The Star of Redemption:**

* **Genesis of the Work:**
    * Written during and after World War I (1918-1919), primarily on army postal cards.
    * Represents the culmination of Rosenzweig's "new thinking," which emphasizes:
        * Common sense over abstract philosophizing.
        * The concrete individual over abstract "humanity."
        * The significance of time and history.
        * A fusion of philosophy and theology.
        * Distinct but equally important roles for Judaism and Christianity.
* **Critique of Idealism:**
    * Rosenzweig challenges Hegelian Idealism for neglecting the individual and their lived experience.
    * He argues for the priority of being over thought, emphasizing the limitations of pure reason.
* **Centrality of Language:**
    * Rosenzweig champions "speech-thinking," recognizing language as more than a tool for expressing pre-existing thoughts.
    * He draws on thinkers like Schelling, Humboldt, and Feuerbach, who saw language's role in shaping consciousness and facilitating dialogue.
    * Speech-thinking emphasizes the dynamic and unpredictable nature of true communication, contrasting it with the solitary nature of abstract thought.
* **The Paths of Existence:**
    * The Star of Redemption explores the interconnectedness of God, World, and Man through the "paths" of Creation, Revelation, and Redemption.
        * **Creation:** God's ongoing act of bringing the world into being.
        * **Revelation:** God's self-disclosure and love for humanity, manifested through language and dialogue.
        * **Redemption:** The culmination of creation and revelation, signifying the ultimate fulfillment of existence through love and the overcoming of death.
    * These themes are depicted through the imagery of two intertwined triangles forming a six-pointed star.

**III.  Beyond the Star:**

* **Rosenzweig's later life:**
    * Married Edith Hahn in 1920 and became head of the Freies JÃ¼disches Lehrhaus (Free Jewish House of Study) in Frankfurt.
    * Diagnosed with a debilitating illness (ALS) in 1922 but continued to live a full intellectual and spiritual life.
    * Died in 1929.
* **The Star's Legacy:**
    * Encourages readers to engage in philosophical inquiry as a step towards a more authentic and meaningful life.
    * Emphasizes the importance of integrating philosophical reflection with concrete action in the world.

**The Star of Redemption remains a challenging and rewarding work, urging readers to move beyond abstract systems of thought and embrace the complexities of existence through dialogue, love, and faith.**
