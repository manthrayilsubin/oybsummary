Abraham's Faith & Justification:--<br><br>- --Main Point:-- Abraham was counted righteous by God because he believed in the Word of Jehovah, which was Jesus in his pre-existent form.<br>- --Evidence:-- Genesis 15:1-6 describes the Word of Jehovah appearing visibly to Abraham in a vision, giving him a promise, and Abraham believing in this Word.<br><br>--2.

John 1:18 states that no one has seen God, but Jesus, who is at the Father's side, has made God known.<br><br>--3.

Jesus then states that Abraham rejoiced at seeing his day in John 8:56 and emphasizes his pre-existence in John 8:58.<br><br>--4. Moses' Faith in Jesus:--<br><br>- --Main Point:-- Moses saw Jesus in his pre-existent form and left Egypt for the sake of Christ, demonstrating his faith in Jesus.<br>- --Evidence:-- Hebrews 11:24-28 describes Moses choosing to be mistreated with the people of God rather than enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. This is attributed to his recognizing the reproach of Christ as greater than earthly treasures, which he could only do by seeing the invisible Christ.<br><br>--5. Jesus in the Cloud and the Spiritual Rock:--<br><br>- --Main Point:--  Jesus was the one who appeared in the cloud guiding and nourishing the Israelites during their journey out of Egypt. <br>- --Evidence:--  1 Corinthians 10:1-4 states that the Israelites all passed through the sea and ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink, which came from the spiritual rock that accompanied them. This rock was Christ. <br><br>--6. The Earliest Copy of Jude & The God Christ:--<br><br>- --Main Point:--  The oldest copy of the book of Jude (P72) states that it was God Christ, or God who is Christ, who saved the Israelites from Egypt and destroyed those who didn't believe.<br>- --Evidence:-- Jude 4-5 describes Jesus as the only master and Lord. The earliest copy of Jude 5 states that the God Christ delivered the people out of Egypt. <br><br>--7.  Jewish Recognition of the Word of God as a Person:--<br><br>- --Main Point:--  Even Jews who don't believe in Jesus acknowledge the Word of God as a Divine person, suggesting the accuracy of the New Testament.<br>- --Evidence:-- Jewish Targums, which are translations of the Hebrew Bible, often interpret the Word of God as a Divine person. <br><br>--8.

This implies that the God seen by the patriarchs and prophets was in fact Jesus.<br><br>--9.  Jesus as the Jehovah of the Old Testament:--<br><br>- --Main Point:-- The Jehovah of the Old Testament is identified with Jesus, as the Bible repeatedly points to Jesus as the pre-existent one who interacted with the Old Testament figures.<br>- --Evidence:--  Numerous instances in the New Testament, including the examples discussed above, explicitly identify Jesus as the one who appeared to the patriarchs and prophets of the Old Testament. <br><br>--10.  The Importance of Recognizing Jesus in the Old Testament:--<br><br>- --Main Point:--  Understanding Jesus' presence and actions in the Old Testament provides a deeper understanding of Scripture and emphasizes the unity of God's plan.<br>- --Evidence:--  The evidence presented throughout the discussion demonstrates the consistent presence and activity of Jesus throughout the entire Bible, revealing the coherent narrative of God's plan for salvation. <br>
