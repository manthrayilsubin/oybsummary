## Attia's Rule: Prioritize Exercise Fundamentals for Longevity <br><br>**Before delving into nuanced dietary debates or supplement comparisons, prioritize these fundamental exercise goals:**<br><br>* **Strength:**<br>    * Dead hang for at least 1 minute (women) / 2 minutes (men) at age 40.<br>    * Air squat at 90 degrees for 2 minutes (both sexes) at age 40.<br>    * Farmer carry body weight for 2 minutes (men) at age 40.<br>    * Farmer carry 75% body weight for 2 minutes (women) at age 40. <br>* **Cardiorespiratory Fitness:**<br>    * Achieve a VO2 max in the top 75th percentile for your age and sex. <br>    * Utilize online calculators to estimate VO2 max based on your performance in activities like running, biking, or rowing.<br><br>**Understanding All-Cause Mortality (ACM) Risk Factors:**<br><br>* **Smoking:** Increases ACM risk by approximately 40%. <br>    * This translates to a 40% higher risk of death at any given time compared to non-smokers.<br>* **High Blood Pressure:** Increases ACM risk by 20-25%.<br>* **End-Stage Kidney Disease (often linked to uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension):** Increases ACM risk by a staggering 175%.<br>* **Type 2 Diabetes:** Increases ACM risk by approximately 25%.<br><br>**Prioritizing Exercise for Longevity:**<br><br>* **Muscle Mass & Strength:**<br>    * Low muscle mass is associated with a 3x higher ACM risk compared to high muscle mass.<br>    * Strength is an even stronger predictor, with low strength potentially leading to a 3.5x higher ACM risk. <br>* **Cardiorespiratory Fitness:**<br>    * Individuals in the bottom 25th percentile for VO2 max have a 2x higher ACM risk than those in the 50-75th percentile.<br>    * Comparing the bottom 25th percentile to the elite (top 2.5%), the difference in ACM risk jumps to a remarkable 5x. <br><br>**Key Takeaways:**<br><br>* Focus on building a strong foundation of strength and cardiovascular fitness before getting lost in dietary or supplement debates.<br>* Utilize specific, measurable goals like those outlined above to track progress. <br>* Consult online resources for estimating VO2 max based on your chosen activities.<br>* Remember, you don't need to be a world-class athlete to reap the significant longevity benefits of exercise. <br>
