when it talks about Abraham I believe in.the the New Testament as well it says.that Abraham was counted righteous.because he believed god.brother added add to that which person.did he believe and he was justified.uh Yahweh right you believe in God the.word of Jehovah it was Jesus who.appeared to him because if you go to.Genesis 15 1-6 it says the word of.Jehovah came to Abraham in a vision.saying so the word appeared to him.invisible form and spoke to him and gave.him a promise and Abraham believed in.the word who appeared to him visibly and.that word is Jehovah's God yeah.wow yeah gen15 if he opens it up so you.guys don't think I'm making it up.so we'll tie it in with another passage.if you guys are interested so this is.how you destroy all these false.ideologies because you show all the New.Testament perfectly agree.considering the nature of the godhead.concerning the word being a person which.is one of the examples I was going to.give you so ironic that you brought this.up pay attention brother now this.translation doesn't have the word say.but it is in the Hebrew after these.things the word of the Lord came to.Abraham in a vision and it should have.said saying if you look at your Bible.Hub from my memory if it doesn't fail me.the word saying is there so the word.came saying speaking and what did he say.to Abraham fear not Abraham I am your.Shield your reward you shall be very.great now Abraham starts complaining to.him well hold on I have no Sons.I have a servant Eliezer and he's going.to be my Heir because if I die then my.servant takes my possession so what are.you going to do for me.you gonna give me an air now look at.verses four and five.verses four and five.and behold the word of Jehovah came to.him and the Hebrews has saying.and you may need to confirm it so they.can see it in the Bible but in a minute.say this man shall not be your heir your.very own son shall be your Heir so I'm.going to give you a son but your servant.Eliza won't be your Heir so count on it.now here's how we know the word appeared.visibly because pay attention to verse.5. and he brought him outside that means.the word and Abraham are inside.Abraham's tent so he's inside talking to.him he says now come out come out of.your tent because I want to show you.something and then he shows them the.stars and said look toward heaven and.Number the Stars if you are able to.number them then he said to him so shall.your officer and be now comes verse six.and he believed Jehovah and he counted.to him as righteousness do you.understand it was Jesus the word in his.premium existence appearing visibly to.Abraham whom Abraham trusted in and who.Justified Abraham.so this is why the Jews say that um if.you read some of the Town moves it says.that it's the memra like the word of the.Lord 100.if you read the targets you'll see in.these examples and for Christians who.don't need the Jewish interpretation.which is good because if Jews who don't.believe in Jesus are confirming this.word.is a Divine person that only shows how.accurate and faithful the New Testament.is but I'm going to give you a verse as.Christians why we know Jesus had to have.showed up as Jehovah God to the.Patriarchs as a Christian now for the.Jews who use the talmud the target memes.now watch here here it is real quick.real quick I just wanted to.confirmware so we're in the Interlinear.of the Hebrew and uh it does say you.know after these things came the word of.Yahweh to Abram in a vision saying.sacrifice contemplations that drop the.word saying I don't know why they did.that because if you just drop the word.you're going to think oh well God is.speaking to him oddly or you know it's.come out no it is a person sent by God.called the word who then speaks to.audibly and appears visibly.now let me give you the proof from the.New Testament that you must believe this.is Jesus appearing John 1 18. I'm going.to give you some verses from John to.prove it.John 1 18. yeah.and staff for us make sure you're paying.attention because you come to us all the.time talking about the Jews never.believed this or Jesus isn't in the Old.Testament all kind of stuff bro this is.gold.and you can then show him later the.Jewish targams they've been translating.English they're online so he can see.Jews who don't believe in Jesus will.tell you that this God appearing they.called them the word of God this is the.word of God this is the word of God so.the Jews saw.that this word is a person set by God.who happens to be God they sought.because the Hebrew Bible gives you.plenty of examples and if you want a few.more I can give it to you but here is.the proof for the Christian for the.Christian.that Jesus is the one that was revealing.God to the patriarch and the prophets no.one has seen has ever seen God notice no.one has ever that includes the time of.Abraham Isaac and Jacob has seen God and.by the way I had a debate with a.Unitarian I don't know his name I know I.think his first name is Andrew I don't.know if his last name is Griffith or.Griffin go watch our debate he got.discombobulated and pretty much lost the.debate entirely because this verse.rocked him he didn't know how to respond.to it go watch it it's on my channel.it's on also gospel true Channel he set.up the debate now why did it Rock him.because now notice no one has ever seen.God so I asked the question.does this include a time of Abraham.Isaac and Jacob yeah but now you got a.problem the only God who's at the.father's side he has made him known now.he didn't believe Jesus pre-existed.according to John 1 18.if anyone has seen God at any time.that's because Jesus who's in the Muslim.of the father made him known so who was.the god that Abraham Isaac and Jacob and.Moses and Isaiah saw now remember he.believes the New Testament if you tell.me it's not Jesus you're saying John.contradicts the Old Testament because.John says no one at any time can know.God unless Jesus shows up and makes God.known to them.you see that right there that's right so.you cannot Escape that from the New.Testament Jesus was there active before.he became flesh as the god that they saw.whom they worship who's called the word.of God word of Jehovah the angel of God.the messenger of God messenger of.Jehovah and various other names.and now to show you where Jesus himself.says Abraham and I saw each other now I.know Chris and Avery know this so sorry.for taking too much time but to help the.others go to John 8 39-40. here's a.again ties in with you can be ethnically.a Descent of Abraham but not truly his.seed.John 8 39-40 because the Jews say we are.sons of Abraham and she says no you're.not.why why aren't they the sons of Abraham.notice they answered him Abraham is our.father Jesus said to them if you were so.here's the answer to the question.fewer Abraham's children you'd be doing.the works of Abraham that Abraham did so.you catch it to be a true son of Abraham.is to believe like Abraham and act in.obedience like Abraham and who did.Abraham believe in the word who did he.obey the word so if you're truly are.sons of Abraham you will do what Abraham.did but now you see.to kill me a man who has told you the.truth that I heard from God this is not.what Abraham did so here he's saying.unlike you who are trying to kill me.Abraham didn't try to kill me.that's how I know you don't belong to.Abraham would you catch it you're trying.to kill me Abraham didn't try to do this.so Abraham didn't try to kill you Jesus.no he did not try to kill me.but you're trying to kill me which is.proof you don't belong to him but now.Abraham's been dead for 2 000 years what.do you mean Abraham did not do this did.not try to kill you because as someone.in the comments section brought up he.later then says John 8 56 truly I say to.you oh I'm sorry John 8 56 he says your.father Abraham rejoiced at seeing my day.and he saw it was glad that's Johnny 56..now let's break that down for those who.are injured for the first time.Abraham saw Christ in two ways he saw.him prophetically God making known to.him his coming that the Messiah is.coming to die for your sins to atone for.you and save you that's one way but.there's another way he saw him he saw.him face to face now the Jews understood.that Jesus is saying that he and Abraham.saw each other face to face that you saw.Abraham and saw his reaction because how.do you know how he reacted you're saying.he rejoiced and was glad how do you know.that because in 57 they say you're not.yet 50 years old man you're not even 50..you've seen Abraham.he's been dead for 2 000 years what in.the world are you talking about you saw.him do you saw his reaction.now Christ could have corrected them he.could have said that's not what I mean.what I mean is God revealed to him is.coming.no he actually confirms they got his.point yeah I did see him but here's.where you're wrong I may not look 50..but don't let my physical appearance.mislead you I'm much older than 50 and.that's where 58 comes in most surely I.say to you truly truly I say to you.before Abraham came into being I am I'm.older than 50 because I was there before.your father was born I was there when he.was born and I continued to be long.after he's died unlike him I ever live.and that's how I saw him and saw his.reaction.that's beautiful.I just want to give a shout out really.quick to aleko for uh the the gift thank.you so much God bless you and God bless.everyone who's been giving in the Stream.so far.uh it goes a long way so thank you guys.so much Sam is up here giving some.dropping some gyms as usual you know you.want me to show you where the Bible says.Moses saw Jesus and left Egypt for the.sake of Jesus oh please.Sam's going crazy.yeah if if Adidas was not important yet.why wasn't his name mentioned in the Old.Testament he would have been looking so.easy.I will show you that prophetically it's.a Jehovah will become Jesus no I'm not.saying that I'm saying that why is his.name not in the Old Testament to make it.easy for everybody if you're asking me.the name Jesus itself.okay but friend let me first.clarify what you're asking before you.get excited I know you're excited if.you're asking whether the name Jesus is.there well in what sense are you saying.that it says Jesus well yes and no.because number one it said Jehovah will.become Jesus I'll give you that just be.patient and secondly.there is a man that God said will be a.sign of the Messiah and his name is.Jesus Son of Jehovah who is righteous.and he says this man Jesus who is the.son of Jehovah's righteous who's a.priest he's a picture of the one to come.so by being a picture he foreshadows.that the one to come is Jesus the son of.Jehovah is righteous but give me a time.to show this because I just made a claim.I'm going to prove it if you guys.interested I can go into this prove it.prove it okay now before I do I want you.to go to Hebrews 11 24-28 because oh my.gosh all this Christian Moses left Egypt.I go on Christians we know about John 8.39 40. but I don't see enough Christians.using this Moses left Egypt for Jesus.because he saw Jesus and gave up.everything for Jesus Hebrews 11 24-28.yeah.I'm gonna get to you guys just hold on a.little.man come on man okay well give me a.chance I'll come with you just wherever.you want to take me just don't take me.to Mecca.come to Asia Cashmere.by faith Moses when he was grown up.refused to be called the son of.Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to be.mistreated with the people of God than.to enjoy the fleeing fleeting pressure.so now here is the key now here is a.little translation NIV captures it but.I'm gonna explain what it means he.considered the reproach of Christ.greater than the treasures of Egypt for.he's looking for the reward did you.catch him wait a second wait wait wait.Sam he considered the reproach of Christ.how can Moses know about Christ yeah.because in verse 27 it says he saw.Christ who was invisible.these Hebrews by faith he left Egypt.not being afraid of the anger of the.king foreign.appeared to him visibly because here.when it says reproach of Christ the.meaning is.he accepted being scorned ridiculed.beaten mistreated for the sake of Jesus.Christ he said Christ is worthy that I.lose my wealth and position and status.and be persecuted because Christ is.greater than my status and well so I'm.willing to give it all up for Christ.because it says he saw him who is.invivable wow what.right there who's running scripture.oh my gosh yeah.wait can you be quiet for a second and.let me bask in the glory of my holy.scriptures.well I bask in the gyms that have just.been released Sam one more time break.this down in fact if you want to see an.excellent breakdown use NIV just open up.NIV because you'll see the excellent.breakdown as you break it down it's.saying that Moses saw the invisible.Christ who appeared to invisibly and.when he saw him he then was willing to.give up everything for Christ and except.being beaten rejected and persecuted.because his love for Christ was greater.than his love for the world.foreign.by faith Moses when he had grown up.refused to be known as the son of.Pharaoh's daughter he chose to be.mistreated along with the people of God.rather than to enjoy the fleeting.pleasures of sin he regarded disgrace.for the sake of Christ as greater thou.as of greater value than the treasures.of Egypt because he was looking ahead to.his reward by faith he left Egypt not.fearing the king's anger he pres he.persevered because he saw him who is.invisible so Abraham saw Jesus Moses saw.Jesus they all saw Jesus and if you want.the icing on the cake to prove Moses saw.Jesus go to First Corinthians 10 verses.104..here you go.uh for for the people who like to clip.things and things of this nature please.uh you guys can you guys can use the.stream how you want what was it first.Corinthians I'm sorry ten versus one of.four now you guys want proof that Jesus.was the one that appeared to Moses and.was guiding Israel out of Egypt First.Corinthians 10 verses 104 here it is.guys cut out this section of the stream.make it its own video because this is uh.this is beautiful all right here we are.I'm still in the NIV I I mean that's.fine okay your interview is okay.all right.for I do not want you to be ignorant of.the fact brothers and sisters that our.ancestors were all under the cloud.and that they all passed through the sea.they were all baptized into Moses in the.cloud and in the sea they all ate the.same spiritual food and drank the same.spiritual drink for they drink from the.spiritual rock that accompanied that.accompanied them and that rock was.Christ so who was in the cloud following.hitting them nourishing them Christ.and so Hebrews and First Corinthians.state it was Christ Our Lord and his.premium existence that appeared to Moses.and guided Moses and Israel in the cloud.out of Egypt through the desert into the.promised land.yeah now do you want me to give you.another one that's going to blow your.mind away amen we got nothing but time.man all right go to Jude it's only one.chapter yes okay watch this one now.here's where you're going to get blown.away because the oldest extent copy of.Jude the oldest copy p72 and if uh.someone wants to look it up you can it's.you go to Google put p72 this is the.oldest copy of Jude.that's extent.and it's from the late second century.early third century I'm going to tell.you how it reads but before we do that.Jude is just one chapter.okay just one chapter so you just do.Jude one.open up now here's what I want you to do.I want you to read for us four slowly so.I can get it I'll come back if you want.to answer sap where.Jesus is prophesied by name.if you can brother.for certain.people have crept in unnoticed who long.ago were designated for this.condemnation.ungodly people who pervert the grace of.our God into sensuality and deny our.only master and Lord Jesus Christ now.who's the only master and Lord we have.Jesus Christ okay keep it in mind.because now in verse 5 it's going to.explain now let me give you the context.judah's warning that false prophets.false teachers have crept in and that.God is going to destroy them because.that's his pattern like God destroyed.the immoral and the false prophets and.teachers in the past he's going to do.that to these false teachers and those.are immoral now so he's going to give.examples as a warning hey you remember.what happened in the Old Testament.that's what's going to happen to these.perverts right yeah he's going to give.you three examples from the Old.Testament what God did to the immoral.and false teachers right.but now read verse life his first.example.verse five.now I want to remind you although you.once fully knew it that Jesus who saved.a people out of the land of Egypt.afterward destroyed those who did not.believe wait.Jesus is the one who brought them out of.Egypt but then destroyed them in the.desert.well hold on I'm going to get you some.meat guys hold on let me explain why.this reads Jesus in the King James.Version New King James Version it says.Lord but you can tell who the Lord is.from verse 4 the Lord is Jesus Christ so.he's the Lord saving them now why do.translations like NIV and ESV have Jesus.because our earlier copies of Jude have.the word Jesus so they went with the.earlier copies where it reads Jesus but.do you know that the earliest copy of.Jude the oldest surviving copy we have.of Jude it's p72. do you know what that.says I just sent you something in.private I wrote an article on this you.know what the earliest copy of Jude 5.reads that we've discovered you know.what it says right that the god Christ.Jesus delivered them wow.in the earliest copy of Jude verse 5 it.says Theos Christos that it was the god.Christ Christ the God it was Christ as.God who was there delivering them.yeah and if you if you ever you could.check your private I just gave you the.link to the article posted it in the.chat all right now if you're going to.give you the verse in private so you can.plaster because I can't do it oh man let.me show you what the word says this is a.translation.of P 72 the oldest surviving copy of.Jude the oldest surviving copy of the.Jude this is what it reads so here it is.in private chat if you want to plaster.it you'll see it says but I want to.remind you about what you have always.known namely that the god Christ or God.who is.Christos save people out of Egypt but.then he destroyed those who did not.believe that's what it says in the.oldest copy of Jude fly because in the.context it is clear.that the Lord the god that saved Israel.and destroyed in the desert is Jesus.because verse 4 We're told Jesus is that.Lord.right here guys if you guys can see.there it is guys go to Google the.greatest scholar ever lived.p72 Jude.it's reads Theos Christos and the other.earlier copies read Jesus so the.earliest copies of Jude the earliest one.says God Christ The God Who is Christ.and the other other copies say Jesus but.later copies have it as Lord.so all of these readings are telling us.the same thing Jesus is that Lord Jesus.is that God who led Israel out of Egypt.and destroyed them in the desert for.their disobedience.
