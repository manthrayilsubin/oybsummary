guess what positive thinking can heal.you of any disease negative thinking can.create any disease it could even kill.you you believe you're gonna die that's.a belief help me understand the way in.which our thoughts and our feelings our.emotions are transmitted to ourselves.into our genes anger has a chemistry.jealousy has a chemistry all of our.emotions are chemicals and I say so what.I say you have a thought in your head.and that thought is translated into.Chemistry by the by the brain the.chemistry goes into the body via the.blood and adjusts the genetics so what.was the point what was the starting.point of that Cascade the answer was a.thought and then people go oh thinking.you know like oh positive thinking I go.guess what for nearly 100 years medicine.is recognized yeah positive thinking is.very important because it provides for.what we call the placebo effect you have.an illness the doctor said there's the.greatest new pill this is made just for.your illness you take that pill you get.better and then you find out the pill is.a sugar pill you're only left with one.conclusion what heals you the belief in.the sugar pill now everybody oh yeah.yeah but no one talked about what about.negative thinking because Placebo is.positive.no sibo and I go equally powerful in.shaping your life but in the opposite.direction how did you first kind of.figure this out and then take this.through the sort of the origins of the.biology of the belief and the.understanding that you've come to.through that and we'll get deep into the.Weeds on this talk about epigenetics and.gene expression and lots of other other.cool stuff Mark uh this is an ancient.history story for me right now because.it's about 50 years ago um even more.than 50. I was cloning stem cells and.people go stem cells that's a topic of.conversation but what are stem cells.stem cells Are embryonic cells in your.body and the reason why you have.embryonic cells in your body is very.simple uh when you look in the mirror.see yourself as a single entity that's.an illusion you're actually made out of.50 trillion cells the cells are the.living entity and Bruce is a community.of cells uh Mark as a community of cells.and so I say well this is great 50.trillion cells and then I go but every.minute we lose millions of cells yeah I.mean the number is so hard to imagine.but when you're doing trillions that.number is so big that nobody understands.that oh trillion but it's uh so we lose.million cells every minute or so and by.the end of the day you've lost about uh.several uh 100 billion cells I go well.how many days can you live if you lose.that many cells every day and the answer.is you can't and so I want everyone to.understand if you're watching this show.uh the reason why you're watching this.show is that inside your body are stem.cells which is another word for.embryonic cell and I say what are their.functions well obviously what the point.is if you're losing that many cells.every day you have to replace that many.cells every day and so uh if your.question do I have stem cells the answer.is if you're watching this program yes.you do everybody knows me but how good.they are how old they are how they.function that berries but yes we always.themselves so uh I was teaching in the.medical school medical students and I.was teaching a cell biology and.understanding nature of genetics and I.go back back in those days the.conventional story unfortunately it's.still the conventional story because the.people the public hasn't caught up with.the science the story was uh that genes.control the character of your life and I.go well uh that was a you know a very.unfortunate situation because I say well.wait a minute as far as you noted you.pick the genes you came with I go no and.I said if you don't like the.characteristics can you change those.genes they go no and then we add on top.of that genes turn on and off by.themselves and all of a sudden you start.to realize what we have been teaching is.victimization meaning your life is not.under your control your life is under.the control of the genes and you have no.control over them and all of a sudden I.say we're a victim and people please.understand when a person perceives.themselves to be a victim they're.perceiving themselves to be powerless I.have no control and when a person is.powerless what do you think they're.going to do they're going to look for.somebody to empower them and.unfortunately having been a former.professor in medical school uh what is.controlling us is in one sense.controlled by the pharmaceutical.industry because those are The Rescuers.they're coming in your body's not.working right we have a chemical we'll.put that chemical in you'll be safe and.and everybody gives up and goes yes give.me a prescription and I go let's look at.this for a couple of seconds number one.is this is that.genes when everybody has been told genes.turned on jeans turn off let me give you.a very important Insight a gene is.simply a blueprint to make a protein and.the proteins are the building blocks of.your body about a hundred thousand.different proteins and I go but proteins.are very complex mole molecules and they.wear out they break down you know you.put a piece of meat on a plate and come.back a week later that meat's not going.to be the same and I go so your proteins.are breaking down normal wear but you.have to replace them and they're very.complex molecules so interesting point.is the gene is a blueprint to make the.Protein that's exactly what it is I go.so why is that important that answer is.very simple.go into an architect's office and she's.working on a blueprint and say hey.is your blueprint on or off and she.would look at you like hey crazy it's a.blueprint there's a lot and off I go.precisely.blueprints are information but they have.to be read you read a blueprint so I say.the genes are information.but which genes which blueprints are.going to look at have to be selected I.go well who does the selecting I go ah.now we jump from the genes making the.selection and we find out that.Consciousness I go number one let's.clear the air right here this is a very.important point.that the most valid science on this.planet today the most valid science is.quantum physics there's no more truth.there's more truth than any other.science I go recognize a fact principle.number one from day day one quantum.physics 1927.Consciousness is creating our life.experience.and I go this is not philosophy this is.actually physics and I go oh my God.Consciousness is creating a well in.medicine as most people know for years.and years only until recent times that.even Consciousness come into our.understanding because I still didn't.have a course in Consciousness in.medical school so I'm not sure they're.still there it's not there yet that's.quite unfortunate because what they're.still predict you know what they're.still suggesting to the public is.um you're controlled by genes and if.you're controlled by genes then that.means you have no control and that means.you're a victim and that means we must.find somebody to heal us uh and the.relevance about all that is uh genes are.responsible this is a very important.scientific fact genes are responsible.for less than one percent of disease I.go wait a minute everybody was jeans for.alcoholism genes for diabetes genes and.genes I go no no no no no no.genes are for less than one percent and.uh you're talking about single Gene.disorders for sort of autosomal.dominance yeah there's no actually.there's about six of them there's about.six dominant one gene you got this Gene.you have like hemophilia you got a.hemophilia Gene you got hemophilia okay.Down syndrome or whatever that's right.okay uh and so the the bottom line is.this.that we have to understand what is.controlling the genes well this is where.50 years ago I was culturing or cloning.stem cells and I said wait wait stem.cell embryonic cell cloning you put one.cell in a Petri dish all by itself and.it divides every 10 hours so first.there's one then there's two then.there's four eight sixteen doubling.exponential yeah at the end of the week.30 000 cells in the petri dish.most important scientific fact they all.came from one parent that meant they're.all thirty thousand genetically.identical cells so I split the cells.into three Petri dishes all dishes are.genetically identical cells but I change.or just stick with me on a minute folks.because to get to this we're getting.there again I know you're getting to the.answer to the question uh gross cells in.a fluid called culture medium a culture.medium is a laboratory version of blood.so if I grow human cells I say what's.human blood made out of and then in the.lab I synthesize a version called.culture medium well since I culture.since I'm synthesizing the culture.medium and lab I make three different.versions of culture medium now remember.culture medium is environment for the.cells and I make three slightly.different versions of culture medium.let's call them environment a b and c so.I have three dishes genetically.identical cells and then what's.interesting about it is I feed one dish.environment a I feed another dish.culture medium with environment B and.the third dish with a different culture.different.environment that's all this basically is.but what happened is environment a the.cells form muscle and environment B.genetically identical cells but they.form bone and in the third dish again.genetically identical cells but a.different environment they form fat.cells and I'm thinking oh my God I'm.teaching in the medical school room.right next door that genes control life.and these experiments say the.determination of the fate of those cells.wasn't based on the genes they all had.the same genes it was based on the.environmental input to that the culture.medium so I go oh my goodness so the.chemistry of the environment was.selecting the genes I go yeah and I go.okay now that's great what the hell does.that mean for me as a human well uh.let's just take a jump I'm growing cells.in a plastic dish but as a human we are.skin covered Petri dishes yes underneath.your skin you've got 50 trillion cells.and the original culture medium blood I.go so what I say it doesn't make a.difference if the cells in the plastic.dish or in the skin dish it's still.controlled by the environment culture.made in blood the chemistry and then all.of a sudden it says well wait so what.controls my genes I go same as in the.plastic dish it's the chemistry of your.blood.and I go oh and and then I say but what.determines the chemistry of my blood I.go the brain is the chemist I go yeah.yeah but that's still didn't answer the.question what chemistry should I put.into that blood the brain is going to.make it I go and this is the the part.that changed my entire life is out it.says wait a minute.whatever thoughts you have in your head.it's a vision.and what happens is the brain translates.that vision of the thought into.complementary chemistry if you have a.vision of Love You release beautiful.chemistry into the blood dopamine for.pleasure oxytocin bonding a growth.hormone and I go what's the relevance.let's say when you're in love you feel.great and your cells are getting.nourished by growth hormone which gives.them great health and that's why when.people fall in love they're they're they.glow they're healthy health love.produces Health but in contrast if I.have a picture of fear I don't release.love chemistry now I release protection.chemistry I'm afraid of something so I.put in to my system stress hormones I.put in factors that affect the immune.system and I go these this is different.chemistry so I said wait there's a.chemistry for growth love and there's a.chemistry for protection and that's fear.love opens up and makes you grow fear.shuts you down and puts you in.protection and you can't stay shut down.for a long period of time because that.interferes with all the functions of the.body so guess what positive thinking can.heal you of any disease negative.thinking can create any disease it could.even kill you you believe you're gonna.die you're that's a belief and I say so.believe the picture is translated into.chemistry brain and the chemistry via.the blood goes to the cells and controls.genetics and behavior so your thoughts.are the primary control of your genes.and I go significance just simple.conclusion the old story what is called.genetic determinism genes determine the.character of your life that's what most.people learn.is is no longer valid uh it is now.recognized uh that the genes are.receptive to the signal that you send.them and all of a sudden I say well then.your thoughts are overriding your genes.I go yes they do and then a conclusion.which Mark has been talking about for.years is well then you better start.thinking healthy thoughts because it's.the negative thoughts I put the.chemistry in that that will create any.disease and all of a sudden it goes.positive thinking negative thinking but.it's all connected to belief yeah it's.so powerful Bruce this is such a huge.insight and I I want to get into the.Weeds on this a little bit I just sort.of want to back up a little bit because.I think we we really do have a very.granular understanding about how food.influences gene expression and.epigenetics and our biology we have a.deep understanding of how exercise and.sleep and stress which is sort of a form.of our thoughts but those all we know.regulate our biology and in fact you.know 95 percent of.chronic disease is caused by our.exposome everything that our genes are.exposed to now it's food it's exercise.it's stress it's toxins is our.microbiome and it's our thoughts so I.want to kind of dive deep because we've.died very deep on these other topics I.want to dive deep.on the mechanisms the Science Under.underlying this hypothesis that is that.our thoughts influence our biology and.no Candace per from the NIH who I I know.is a friend of yours and I knew very.well wrote a book called molecules of.emotion how are yes emotions.really are regulating our biology and.these there are literally molecules of.our motion that are speaking to every.cell in our body so can you kind of walk.us through now you've taken this from a.high level okay yes you've sort of.looked at how different inputs influence.our cell biology and our gene expression.and our epigenetics.but how does it actually work on a on a.granular level what is the science.behind this because I think this is.where it gets really interesting the.moment it does because up until you know.this time of understanding it was a.black box life happens.but once we understand this.when I started to show that the.environment was controlling the cells.then of course the the direction was.well how does the environment control.the direction of the cell and it led me.way off the trail of genes because genes.are just the blueprints the question was.how does an environmental signal cross.into the cell and then regulate the.genetics uh and this is the foundation.as you brought to our attention to Mark.here is it's a new understanding of.genetics it's called not genetic control.it's called epigenetic control and.people go well.genetic control epigenetic it all sounds.the same but I say no it's a.revolutionary difference because Epi.means above I mean what do we call skin.we call skin.epidermis I said why do we call it that.because Epi means above and so I say.epidermis means above the dermis and I.go yes just underneath the skin is a.layer called dermis and the skin.integument is above the dermis so we.call it.epidermis and I say so what about.epigenetic control I go old story this.character is under genetic control.meaning genes controls the character new.story this character is under Epi.genetic control they go what does that.mean I go Epi means above Epi Gene above.the gene control and that's when all of.a sudden we started to recognize that.the environment.is controlling the genes now the.profound difference for all the people.out here is very important for this.reason.well the Gene's story says I can't.control them they control me the news.story epigenetic says it seemed firemen.and response to the environment that.controls the genes I go wait a second.then that's my option I'm the one that.determines how I'm going to respond I'm.the one that's going to control my.environment all of a sudden I go then we.went from victim to master if you.understand this then you recognize I.have power over my genes through my.thoughts.placebo effect no sibo effect that's the.the term in Medicine of how the thoughts.are going to interact here uh and so I.said well when I started to show this to.my colleagues they looked at me because.everybody at that time 1967.was invested in genetics everyone I.everyone around me in the lab everyone.was genetics we're going to find a gene.for this we're going to find a gene for.that I'm the only guy out there going.it's not genetics it's the environment.and of course they've said who are you I.said Bruce and they said yeah that's.what we thought uh and they let it go.and I had to work for a while because.the missing piece was how did that.environmental signal get into that cell.yes that's what I want to know tell us.so I went back and I said look this.works on bacteria the most primitive of.all organisms the environment of the.bacteria is controlling the genetics and.behavior so I go wait there's no nucleus.and there there are genes and I also did.some research where I took the nucleus.out of the cell the nucleus is Pro in.your textbooks right now it says the.nucleus is the brain of the cell.where the hell they come up with that.and I go because they thought genes were.like neurons they turn on they turn off.they control our biology so the nucleus.is envisioned as the brain the joke the.joke is the nucleus is the gonad the.reproduction structure I was joking in.the lecture I said how did a bunch of.male scientists come up with the idea.that the gonad was the brain and you.know I was a big joke and all that but.the reality was.the the brain of the cell has to respond.to the environment and then send a.message to the genes I go how does it do.that I started looking not at the.nucleus I started looking at the skin of.the cell the membrane and I go why is.that relevant and I go well if you know.human embryology guess where our brain.comes from the membrane the skin of the.embryo and I go oh then a cell and a.human both of them the skin is the.source and I say why is the skin the.source the answer is simple the skin is.the separation from the outside to the.inside so the skin can read outer.environment inner environment and adjust.the cell so I start looking at the.membrane at that time the there there's.a principle of biology that is called.that the the structure implies the.function.the more complex the structure the more.complex the function so if you look at.the the membrane in the electron.microscope it's the most simple organism.organization in the cell it looks like.an Oreo cookie dark light dark a little.structure and that's all it is so for.the longest time my colleagues would say.oh yeah the skin is like plastic wrap it.just holds the cytoplasm together but.what they couldn't see.is in that electron microscope and you.couldn't see there are proteins that are.built into the membrane.and I say there are two classes of.protein this is where it comes down to.the whole world changes one class of.proteins has antennas just like.television antennas they're called.receptors.okay and it's built into the skin of the.cell receptor I go again where are your.receptors Eyes Ears Nose taste touch.pain temperature all your receptors are.built into the skin so you and the cell.have the receptors built in the skin but.in the Cell It's primitive and simple.it's a protein with an antenna and when.a signal comes in that is in complement.to that antenna it causes the protein to.change shape.and that changing shape is the action of.Life proteins proteins provide for.anatomy yep you can be alive or dead you.still have the anatomy and is still.based on proteins a cadaver is a dead.person but it's got all the proteins.they still look like a human.what's the difference between a live and.a dead person the answer is this.and a live person the proteins respond.to environmental signals cold hot rain.what's going on in the world The.receptors pick it up just like our eyes.ears knows we know what's going on in.the world we can see it feel it smell it.taste it the cell does the same cell's.actually a miniature human and I go so.what about it I go how does it see the.world I say there are proteins called.receptors just like this is a receptor.of the eye.and I say how does it see the world I.say when a signal matches the receptor.causes the receptor to move.and that's where life comes from it's a.simple equation Protein Plus signal.equals Behavior.that's fundamental about life I don't.care if it's a whole human or a single.protein it's the environmental signal.that gauges the protein that causes us.to live and move that's the movement of.life is proteins changing shape so I say.yep it takes a signal and a protein.what's the difference between a live.person and a dead person they both have.proteins.but in the dead person no signals no.signals are coming in so the proteins.never change shape if they never change.shape then there's no movement there's.no life cadaver Okay so.I'm looking at the membrane and I.recognize right away there are receptors.that are responding to these signals but.there's a second protein type called a.channel.a channel means like a pipe uh or.connection from one side to the other.English channel is a channel of water.that goes between Britain and Europe as.this narrow channel of water the English.Channel a channel is a protein that is.closed normally and when a signal comes.in the protein opens up so it's closed.and when the signal comes the protein.opens up and a signal can go through the.cell so I say what do we have.protein 1 receptor sees the signal in.the environment protein to the channel.translates that signal into a signal.that goes into the cell and controls.behavior and genetics so I'm studying.this back then in 1985 when I I finally.saw it as like my whole world changed.because I was writing a definition of.the cell membrane.and I gave all the conventional.physiological descriptions of the cell.membrane but this night on this night I.wrote a different definition I recognize.that the membrane is is a crystal.structure if you see the molecules are.all lined up like soldiers.uh and the membrane has a liquid core a.lipid core a visualize a a bread and.butter sandwich.two pieces of bread and a layer of.butter I go water can soak into the.bread but water can't go through the.butter to soak into the other bread.because it can't go across the membrane.that that bread and butter sandwich the.butter stops it so by definition the.membrane is called a non-conductor it's.nothing can get across because when it.hits the lipid nothing in water will go.through the lipid so it's separated from.the outside.but then you put the proteins in there.and like the channel that's one that.opens and closes can let stuff in so I.say oh well then it can conduct some.stuff I go some stuff because the.channels determine what comes in sodium.potassium calcium glucose histamine.whatever the signals are the environment.the channel lets the signal come in.so now I'm looking at the member I said.well it's not a non-conductor because.stuff can go through can everything go.through a full conductor nope nope nope.only what can go through the channels.sodium potassium glucose histamine so.it's like it's not a non-conductor it's.not a full conductor I write it's a.semiconductor.so I now I I Define the membrane and I.wrote this down and here's the.definition 1985 about I'm like one.o'clock in the morning I'm going.the membrane is a crystal.semiconductor with receptors and.channels but there's another word for.receptors called gait so I write down.the membrane is a crystal semiconductor.with Gates and channels and I wrote that.down I go.I just read.just read that definition where where.did I my first computer Macintosh.and right next to it is the book from.Radio Shack.about your microprocessor that runs a.computer and I said oh my God I opened.up the book in the introduction first.paragraph almost.a chip is a crystal semiconductor with.Gates and channels I go.what a coincidence the membrane has the.same definition.but then as I started to follow the.function of the receptor the channel the.membrane and put it all together I said.oh my God it's not like a chip it is a.chip it's a transducer right it.translates the environment with signals.that type on the The receptors Imagine.The receptors on the surface of the cell.they're all these little antennas I say.imagine that that these these uh you.know receptors are uh you know.downloading information I go they not.imagine that's what they do they take.the information from the environment.connected to the channel and that signal.goes into the cell.I go wait a second then the membrane is.not like a chip the membrane is a chip I.go oh my God the nucleus has programs.the nucleus is a hard drive it's got all.the programs how to do stuff yeah but.how do you activate the programs in your.computer you type on the keyboard and.that pulls up the program and I go oh no.the membrane has these antennas which.are like a keyboard if you look at the.surface of the cell there are all these.different Keys sodium key potassium key.glucoskey histamine estrogen I go what.if the environment has that signal it.activates the key just like typing on.the computer and that sends a signal.into the cell which controls the protein.signal plus protein makes the movement.and it also controls the genetics and.all of a sudden I say oh my God a cell.is a programmable chip and that's why an.embryo cell before it's it's been.programmed it can form anything skin.muscle bone brain it can form anything.so it's a embryo is a chip that hasn't.been programmed so Bruce how how does.how does then you know when you have.thoughts or beliefs how do those like.specifically what molecules what what.neurochemicals what hormones what is.regulating and translating your thoughts.and feelings and beliefs good or bad.into biological signals that then is.affecting your health your gene.expression your immune system everything.how can you just kind of can I tell you.okay let's let's back it up the cells.are like in the skin covered petri dish.they're living in a fluid just like.cells in the plastic dish the fluid is.all around the fluid chemistry is going.to determine which receptors are going.to be activated which then through the.channel determines which behavior is.going to be activated so the chemistry.of the environment.determines which genes and which.behaviors are going to be activated.that's what the culture study showed for.sure for sure this culture medium you.get muscle change the culture medium you.get bone and all of a sudden it's like.well then and then we go back to then.the brain is the one that determines the.chemistry and that chemistry then is.based on your thought.am I happy am I afraid am I angry I go.oh these thoughts make different.chemistry like putting it into the blood.of the culture medium of your cells.so so so is it is it like cortisol is it.sex hormones is it every every one of.them like.all of it right everyone so for every.every every signal the cell can receive.there's a receptor that is tuned to that.signal now a very important part about.your work Mark which comes in here is.this I said the culture medium is the.growth medium it provides the nutrition.and the nourishment to make the cells.grow when you eat food you're creating.culture medium that's what the food is.translated into so all of a sudden I.could give you a simple Insight when I.was growing cells in a tissue culture I.didn't buy my ingredients at Kmart you.know I went and bought the highest.quality ingredients in the world because.if I gave them less than quality.ingredients the cells would immediately.show a dysfunction I could look at it in.the microscope put in a culture medium.that isn't a really good culture medium.not a good quality and the cells you can.watch them get sick right there I'm.going well what do you think happens in.the skin covered culture dish you're.making culture medium so there's two.parts of the culture medium uh Mark you.emphasized one of the most important.parts and that is the nutrition element.if I'm not giving the good signals of.food then my cells are not responding in.a proper way if I give them a bad.chemical food uh in the cells you can.watch them they get sick right away you.can watch them die so I go so why is.nutrition important I say because that's.where the culture medium comes from and.that's why it is incompetent upon us to.if you want to be healthy.natural organic you know biodynamic food.growing healthy industrial Farm food is.toxic like what do you mean it's toxic I.go I show in the class a picture of a.farmer uh spraying the plants what the.farmers wearing a hazard suit my God.he's spraying the foods you're gonna eat.and he's wearing an acid suit I think.you know hello hello you know and the.issue is this is that genetic.engineering trying to manipulate food is.a great failure we've lost the.nutritional elements the the elements.the minerals the things that we need to.have in our food are not really fully.present in industrial Farm food and in.addition of course it's toxic because.they spray all the dump stuff on the.food and that's why if you're making.culture medium I made culture medium.I didn't compromise a thing I had to get.the best ingredients because the cells.respond to what is in the culture medium.the blood and if you're eating food and.you're not putting in the best.nutritional elements in that food then.you're compromising the fate of your.cells so again uh I make ultramanian lab.you eat dinner that's right that's right.so we've got we got we know that the.things that are hugely impacting us.we've all accepted food exercise all the.things we talked about the belief stuff.is hard for people because it's like how.do you change your thoughts how do you.change your beliefs you know if you if.you live in a world where everything.looks you know like black versus you.know Rose Colored Glasses I tend to be.more rose-colored glasses you can look.at the same event and two people have.this totally different interpretation.and have absolutely different effects on.their biology so one person can.experience the same thing and create.positive molecules of emotion and.another person can experience exactly.the same thing and experience negative.molecules of motion so in a way this is.a little bit not hunting for people.because okay if I say don't eat sugar.people I can I can figure that out I say.don't think blah blah blah or don't feel.this or do feel this or don't feel more.love and less fear well that's easy to.say hard to do so can you talk about how.do you start to to translate this.science into actionable ways that we can.change our beliefs and change our way of.thinking and change the way we interpret.and filter the world to actually reframe.it and actually start to generate the.power of our thoughts to create Health.and Longevity well let's step back one.second and I said the function of the.brain is to put the chemistry into the.blood and I said yeah but where does it.get it from I said the picture in the.mind I go the mind yeah the mind has a.misleading character the Mind sounds.like oh there's one mind I go no there.are two minds and this is where the.whole world gets screwed up because we.say the Mind well yeah my mind I should.have Consciousness and I want to be.healthy then how come I'm not healthy I.got that in my mind I go because here's.the problem there are two lines and if.you don't get this then nothing makes.sense and I'll give you the reason why.the brain is a computer that's what I.was finding out the cells are Miniature.chips the body's got 50 trillion chips.but when you put all the chips together.that's called a computer so I say so.what's the point about the the this.computer I say let's go back to the old.days when you would buy a brand new.computer you spent a couple thousand.dollars okay uh and and the point about.it is simply this is that you get a.brand new computer you just took it home.two thousand dollars I say brand new I.say push the start button the screen.lights up that's called booting up it's.booted up the screen's light and I go.now do something and you go I can't do.anything I said you just bought a brand.new computer what do you mean you can't.do anything.before you can use a computer you have.to put programs in a computer.I go oh but the brain is is an organic.computer just like the Silicon one you.use I say we need to put programs in so.we can use the computer so I say when do.the programs come in I go ah.the programs start coming in in the last.trimester of pregnancy.the fetus is reading the environment I.said how can a fetus read the.environment it's inside the womb it.again I go remember the fetus is.nourished by the mother's blood I go yep.that's why in the old days when I was in.medical school we say what's the role of.the mother he well take vitamins and.supplements exercise I go oh is that all.the mother has to do well in those days.it was the belief the genes are going to.control it until the mother just had to.nourish it.in the new day of epigenetics where.environmental signals are important all.of a sudden I say blood has nutrition.and blood has environmental signals the.the emotional chemicals anger love.jealousy whatever ones you want they're.chemicals that generate those.experiences so if the mother is having.an experience.then the blood from the mother is going.to go into the fetus.by the last trimester of the brain is.now booted up.but now guess what it'll read pattern if.the mother is has periods of anger then.the chemistry of anger comes in.periodically that's a pattern the fetus.will learn that if the mother's happy.then good happy loving chemistry comes.to the fetus and the fetus is happy so.all of a sudden I say then the first.programming.occurs even before you're born because.while you're in the womb your brain is.downloading programs because the mother.has had Start program she sees the world.in which the fetus is going to live if.the world is Warped torn there's war and.violence and she experiences that then.the chemistry that goes to the fetus is.the stress chemistry which will cause.the body to build up like an athlete and.become a fighter like a street fighter.so all of a sudden it goes very.importantly what it says is simply this.what's the mother's perception of the.world if she feels safe and happy then.the baby is getting information I'm safe.happy grow be in love if she's angry or.she's afraid.then the fetus is afraid does a fetus.know why no the fetus has the chemistry.of fear it's just a chemistry it has no.vision but it knows that out in that.world the mother is giving information.that is not safe.if it's not safe then the genetics has.to change.to make a body that will fight.to survive versus okay so that's when.the programming starts but it really.kicks into gear but Bruce how do people.like change their thoughts because I.think you know what you're saying is.very empowering but it's also very scary.as I listening I'm like wow my beliefs.my thoughts are changing my biology and.making me sick or healthy yeah what how.do I use that information in a practical.way like the big part that we didn't get.to is I said there were two we have the.the programming is the equivalent of.putting a program in the hard drive in.your computer it's built in now it's a.program okay.and then when the conscious mind that's.the creative mind the subconscious mind.the hard drive is the Habit mind it's.got Pro habits or programs programs.their habits and so I learn uh from.experiences I create uh programs in my.uh hard drive but when I'm conscious the.conscious mind is like the Creator that.types on the keyboard I can type in all.the wonderful messages I want to be.healthy I love life I'm going to get a.great job I'm going to find a great.relationship I say oh that's conscious.that's creative that's that's cool.okay what about the subconscious I say.no the subconscious programs didn't come.from you they came from your experiences.in the environment during the.development when you're born was your.father a happy person or an angry person.is your mother you know you how do you.why why do I need a program I'll tell.you why I need a program I have to fit.into a family I have to fit into a.culture and I go yeah but cultures.change over time and I go that's why.it's not genetic you have to learn.culture I say how do you learn I say how.does an infant learn they can't read a.book they can't go to school and here's.the secret.for the first seven years of your life.your brain is not operating with.creative Consciousness which is right.behind your forehead it's operating off.of hindbrain hard drive and I go so why.is that important because the hard drive.is downloading experiences I say how.watch your father watch your mother.watch your siblings watch your community.in a state of uh that development as.it's in the brain is in a vibration.State let's back up.you can put wires on a person's head and.read the brain function it's the energy.vibrations.a child's brain if you put the EEG on.the child's brain up through age seven.it's not functioning at the higher.vibration of Consciousness it's.functioning just a little lower it's.called Theta Theta vibration I go so.watch Theta.Theta is hypnosis.okay so what does that mean I say for.the first seven years of a child's life.the brain is not using creativity the.brain is in hypnosis I say what is it.doing observing how a father behaves.observing how a mother behaves how a.community behaves it observes an in.state of hypnosis downloads the pattern.totally it shapes our whole world view.and beliefs and subconsciousness so how.do we sort of undo that as we get older.I can't get to that yet because first.you have to find out well if I have a.conscious mind it overrides the program.because I'm Creator then how come as.quantum physics said Consciousness is.creating our life experience.then how come the world looks like the.way it does violent tearing apart chaos.all this stuff it's like where's that.coming from I go.that's coming from the subconscious.that's not the conscious the conscious.says I want to be in love I want to be.healthy I want to be happy I go then how.come.we're not living heaven on Earth because.that's what the conscious mind would.create.how come we have this problem and here.comes the answer to the most important.part that you didn't even know what the.question was here's the answer and the.answer is this.the conscious mind can type on the.keyboard just like on your computer you.can put the data in you can create.whatever you want you can type on it but.the conscious mind and here goes can.think.so what I say.thinking is inside I say uh Mark uh.today's Tuesday what are you doing on.Thursday it's not written in front of.you but I bet you in a minute you could.go oh Thursday I am and you have a.picture.in your mind and I say well wait a.minute.then when you were using your conscious.mind you were.back up one second body is a vehicle.like a car it moves around it's got a.steering wheel okay when the conscious.mind it's got its hands on the steering.wheel looking out the window it will.drive you to wishes and desires.and then I go yeah but the conscious.mind can think.what the hell does that mean it's not.looking out the window.the moment you start thinking you're not.looking out you're looking in I said.what if you're driving the car and you.start thinking you start thinking I go.then you're not looking out the.windshield I go.and I go don't worry you know why the.subconscious is programs it knows how to.drive the car and it's a million times.more powerful a computer than the.conscious mind so guess what you don't.even have to pay attention to the road.the subconscious mind will drive it okay.so I go wait every time you are thinking.then the conscious creative mind is no.longer looking out the window.it's looking inside so every time you.are thinking.then the conscious Minds not controlling.the vehicle I go but I'm still here and.I go the subconscious has got programs.and so the moment the conscious mind is.thinking the subconscious mind autopilot.takes over now I tell you where the.problem is where the programs come from.in the subconscious mind go from other.people.did they answer what you wanted did they.you know did their behavior match what.you want in your life probably not that.I go therefore then here's the point and.this is it of all the things we talk.about right now Mark this is it.95 of the day is the amount of time a.person spends thinking.I go well wait a minute then 95 of the.day I'm not driving the vehicle I go.nope 95 of the day the subconscious.programs but they came from other people.good programs bad programs 60 of the.programs we downloaded during that.development are disempowering.self-sabotaging and limiting beliefs and.I go but you're operating 95 of the day.from those programs not from the.creative program because the creative.mind is thinking the biology is taken.over by the program for 50 years I've.given the same story Mark so I'll give.it again another 51 years here's the.same story you have a friend you know.your friend's Behavior very very well.and you know your friend's parent.and one day you see your friend has the.same behavior as the parent so you you.you gotta volunteer you go hey Bill.you're just like your dad.back away from Bill I know exactly what.Bill's going to say you know it too.because you were there bill will go how.could you compare me to my dad I'm.nothing like my dad and I go here's the.reality everybody else.can see that bill behaves like his dad.yeah the only one that can't see it is.Bill I go explanation is simple.bill was programmed by his dad in the.first seven years and those those.behaviors those are programs and then 95.percent of the day bill is thinking so.he's not controlling so the father.program starts manifesting.he can't see it Bill can't see it I go.why not he's not even looking at his own.behavior he's thinking so he's not even.seeing his own behavior but everybody.else does.and everybody else says well wait that's.the same as his dad and then bill goes.what are you talking about why Bill's.the only one that didn't see it and I go.you're ready for this one this is the.Killer.we are all bill.every day every one of us is spending 95.percent of our time thinking and turning.over the control to the subconscious I.go was that a good program or bad.program well sixty percent are negative.so you know and do you see it no.so you become in it's invisible to you.to see your participation all you see is.it's not working I wanted to be happy.and I'm not well that person did this to.me and this person screwed me here and.that and you're blaming all these people.and the idea was hey you didn't see you.were the one that started the program.because you're the one that was playing.the negative programs and they're.responding to it and and I go that means.most people have no understanding of.personal responsibility most people are.victims I'm victim of this I'm a victim.of that and I go no so are you running.your life I say yeah but are you running.it with the conscious creative mind.wishes and desires or are you running it.with the subconscious mind habits and.programs the answer is 95 percent of the.day you're running it from the programs.a very important Point remember the.Consciousness controls the genetics.everyone's thinking cancer is caused by.a gene I go that's a big BS that means.belief system a big belief system story.for this reason and that is this there.is not one gene that causes cancer.there's not one gene you have that Gene.you get cancer no not one I said even.even the bracket Gene you know even.though it's a very high rate of cancer.it's not a hundred percent which means.the environment has an impact and that's.what the point is you know 50 years ago.or 60 100 years ago I had less cancer.than they do now because of.environmental influences of our diet and.environmental toxins for sure well thank.you because that's exactly where the the.issue comes down to uh and the issue.comes down to this where did the cancer.come from I can tell you ready they.followed the fate of what happens when a.baby is adopted into a family where.there's cancer running in that family.the baby adopted baby will get the same.family cancer with the same probability.as any natural siblings except the.adopted baby has totally different.genetics so where'd the cancer come from.being in the family in that first seven.years of programming cancer is a program.and you can change cancer by changing.the program but if you believe the.cancer is uh genetically controlled.which means you have no control then you.all of a sudden say I'm a victim and.then you want to kill all the cancer.cells because that's the technology and.I go the cancer cells are not the.problem they're the symptom that's the.result of a problem and so you can kill.all the damn cancer cells you want.because you never got to the cause of.the problem the cause of the problem was.something that caused a cell to become.cancer and all of a sudden we go back to.the Consciousness and the programming.and the same thing Diabetes Type 2.100.environment 100 environment and and I go.so why this important because as you've.been talking about let's get away from.the idea that I am a genetically.programmed individual no I'm a Creator.and I'm creating this and the emphasis.is how through the blood the chemistry.two parts nutrition.and information and the idea about it is.this if you fail on the nutrition it's.like you the machine will break down.that's what the function is if you don't.take care of the car it breaks down when.you look in the junkyard you see all the.cars piled up I say is that because they.were built wrong genetically incorrect I.go no no it was driver error that put.those cars into the junkyard it's driver.error that's responsible for 99.of disease on this planet so Bruce this.is really powerful work I mean it's just.elucidated the the sort of beautiful.ways in which.you know our environment our beliefs our.attitudes our thoughts literally speak.to every cell in our body and you know.it it for me it sometimes can be a bit.daunting because you know when if you if.you are in a negative spiral or if you.have you know beliefs that you feel like.are so rigid you have to be able to.learn how to rework your thinking you.know I I recently had a friend go to.Hoffman which is a sort of a I don't.know it's a seven day intensive.reworking and re-parenting yourself and.reprogramming of your brain from your.childhood trauma and it was just.profound to see how it helped him to.kind of reshift some of the automatic.ways of thinking and automatic ways of.being that he had now there are many.ways to do this as many approaches.there's many programs there's Byron.Katie there's you know my friend Shelley.lefko's work which is amazing.um Hoffman therapy there's a lot of ways.to get to this uh medicine ceremonies.MDMA assistant psychedelic therapy but I.think it's an important thing to realize.that your health depends on your your.mindset and your way of seeing the world.and your beliefs and your attitudes and.it's not a hairy fairy kind of spiritual.concept it's actually physiology and.biology it's chemistry.basic chemistry yeah yeah and I was you.know you always say the greatest.Pharmacy is the one between your ears.and I think Pharmacy the only real.purpose yeah well there's other.pharmacies it's a real Pharmacy for this.reason if I take a drug and the drug.affects me that means there's a receptor.that is tuned to that drug I think if.you have a receptor on your cell tuned.to that drug do you think it was put on.that cell waiting for the pharmaceutical.company to create the drug I said no if.you've got a receptor for the drug that.means you already make that drug that's.right you're not drinking it then it's.not the the problem is why is that drug.not working that's right I mean the.receptor for mushrooms or LSD or MDMA or.change consciousness.or pot or cannabis are all in your brain.and that's why they work so you already.have these we actually have endogenous.meaning our own molecules that regulate.these Pathways we just have to learn how.to activate them yeah the whole idea.about it is that uh if you're taking a.drug first thing is this the only reason.that drug works is because you already.have a receptor for that drug and if you.already have a receptor for that drug.then by definition you already manifest.or can manifest that drug and then you.have to say why is it not working I say.uh what's your mindset why do some why.do people get sick a lot of them I'll.give you a simple reason.they go in their life okay it has to do.what is the program let's start with.that.what how do I know what my programs are.I say why well you weren't in in the.last trimester of pregnancy the fetus.had no conscious awareness of what was.going on it downloaded programs but not.being aware you're born you were.programmed a whole year from zero to one.by what watching downloading I say okay.tell me the program you got when you.were zero.I don't know I wasn't there I go no okay.you program another whole year from one.to two tell me the program that you got.to go.I wasn't aware of what was going on two.to three at the End by near three you.can start to remember some images that.come in okay so I'm going to tell you.right now simple fact what are your.programs and the answers most people.have no idea what the hell their.programs are why they weren't there but.then here comes the beautiful resolution.95 of your life is from the program so.your life is a printout of your programs.and I say so what does that mean I say.look at your life very simple right now.just look I say the things you like that.come into your life they come in because.you have programs to acknowledge and.support those but here's the one the.things that you want and you have to.work hard you have to put a lot of.effort into I'm I'm gonna make it I'm.working hard I'm I'm working hard to.make it I go why are you working so hard.and the answer you're ready simple the.program you downloaded doesn't support.that and so you're trying to override 95.for a process from a million times more.powerful processor from five percent.from a small conscious processor.mathematically it doesn't work and.therefore look at your life right now.you want to know what the programs are.you're CR you're manifesting from the.program so I say don't worry about the.things that come into your life that you.like because that program's already.there so don't have to deal with it but.you have to start looking and say but.I'm not successful in relationship I'm.not successful in health I'm not.successful on my job and I go we have.been led to believe that I'm just a.victim and these things are happening to.me and I go no that's your own program.uh and so I can tell you right now you.want to see what your programs are look.right now whatever you're struggling to.accommodate or to create that struggle.is not because the universe won't give.it to you that struggle is your program.doesn't support that conclusion so now.you have an idea of I have programs that.aren't working and now of course you.know if I wait here I think Mark will.ask me a question how do you change.those programs but I'll wait till he.asks me that question well I I really I.really love it so just tell us quickly.because we have to wrap up I want to.sort of just quickly how do we change.that program okay the first thing of.understanding is what is the program.again look at where the struggle is but.then you want to put in a new program.and I say well there are three ways to.change the program I say what are they I.say the first way is how did you get the.programs in the first place in the first.seven years your brain was operating at.a lower vibration than Consciousness.called Theta remember.um some of us old enough remember the.old days a hypnotherapist would have a.watch and they'd swing it back and forth.and he's as he's swinging and you're.supposed to watch it go back and forth.he would say you're getting tired you're.getting sleepy I said why.because when you're awake you're.functioning from the higher vibration of.Consciousness but the moment you fall.asleep guess what it drops down to the.next lower vibration Theta.so if you can be in Theta that's what.the hypnotherapist is trying to get you.to relax if you can get into Theta then.it's hypnosis and you can download just.boom so I go number one way of.downloading get in state of hypnosis so.how do you do that I say fall asleep why.the moment your Consciousness.disconnects for the evening the moment.it disconnects The Next Period of time a.short period of time the brain is.operating in Theta hypnosis so if you.put on earphones or earbuds with a.program You Want To Be True in your life.and you can get them self-help programs.and I say every night you put the.earphones or earbuds on and start the.program the moment you fall asleep you.don't hear the program but the.subconscious does it's in a state of.hypnosis so repeating this every night.is called self-hypnosis by repeating.this every night you have to do it a.number of nights because it's not in.Theta for a long period but long and.enough to make a change and all you I.love it what's the how hard is it I say.well to learn fall asleep I go oh okay.that's not too much work you know all I.have to do is fall asleep and the.earbuds are going to play a program that.my subconscious will pick up repetition.of that.will change the program so that's called.self-hypnosis number two.that Theta phase Ends by age seven but.you still learned habits you learn how.to drive a car play an instrument drive.a butt ride a bike I say you learned a.habit after Theta I go how did you do it.that way so number two.repetition practice the new age phrase.which always makes me laugh is fake it.till you make it meaning you're not a.happy person then all day long say to.yourself as many times you can I am.happy I am happy you know I always say.that you can actually.act into your feelings or feel into your.actions right so if you actually can.change your actions your feelings will.change right right and make it permanent.you just repeat it because that's how a.habit is formed repetition.so repeat the new habit repeat it or.repeat it and one day you wake up you.don't have to repeat it because now it's.downloaded and once it's downloaded you.never have to do it again that's a.beautiful part so that's number two.first one again uh is uh self-hypnosis.second one is repetition and the third.one is a new version of psychology.called Energy psychology you've listed a.couple before Mark uh one I use is.called Psy K what is they basically.represent super learning.I was super learning I go maybe you've.seen somebody read a book where they.just move their finger down the page as.fast as they move that finger down they.read all the words that's super learning.well if you can engage super learning.then you can rewrite a program in.minutes you can walk away 10 15 minutes.later with a whole new way of life it.works but you have to get into that that.super learning and there's processes.that could get you there uh one of them.is called Cooks hookup uh and so it.basically says three ways to change.at night put the earphones on.self-hypnosis.during the daytime repetition of a what.you want to be true just keep repeating.it because keep repeating it and number.three engage one of the energy.psychology modalities and let me just.offer the public on my website simple.brucelipton.com.under resources I got 25 or more.different energy psychology modalities.Mark brought up a few of them I've got.those on the website go check it out.there's a little paragraph about this.process and then a website and I say why.is it important and the answer is this.you want to take control of your life.you've only lost it because you.invisible subconscious programming and.that's manifesting in your life use any.of those three processes and you can.rewrite those programs and become uh.powerful yeah let me just close with.this I want to take your time.there's a movie called The Matrix.and it's listed as science fiction I go.no no matrix it's a documentary.well the premise is everybody's been.programmed I go that's not a premise.that's a reality everybody's been.programmed the Jesuits knew this program.and told their followers and nobody.understood what they were saying they.said give me a child until it is seven.and I will show you the man what did.they know they knew that the first seven.years give me the child pill and seven.was programming and the rest of the life.of that person 95 comes from the program.so give me a child till seven and I'll.show you the man and then they create.Catholic school and where the.programming started.and the point about all this is if we.understand this.and you start to recognize the truth of.what we're talking about then what would.happen like in the movie The Matrix they.said you can get out of the program yeah.well that's what you're offering right.how can you get out yeah and I go.Falling in Love.is the same as taking the red pill in.The Matrix get out of the program I say.why and here's the simple reason why do.you play the program because conscious.minds thinking I say what happens when.you fall in love I say you stop thinking.you stay what is called mindful why you.waited for this person to show up.they're here this isn't a time to think.and disconnect it's time to be here be.here now I go what happens.when you fall in love like that you stop.playing the program and I said then what.is the result 24 hours 24 hours your.life went from blah blah blah blah blah.you meet this person you fall in love 24.hours later oh life is beautiful it's.heaven on Earth.it's the honeymoon I go that is what.would happen if you stop playing the.programs the honeymoon is a creation.from the conscious created mind not from.the program and so when you stop playing.the program heaven on Earth I go guess.what you could have this your whole life.it's only when you start thinking again.that the programs show up and throw a.monkey wrench in so what if you rewrite.the programs we just talked about and I.say well then guess what whether you're.paying attention with your conscious.mind or you're thinking in the.subconscious takes over but if the.subconscious has the same program as the.conscious wishes then whether you're.thinking or not thinking you're still.playing.wishes and manifesting Heaven on Earth.if you loved that last video You're.Gonna Love the next one check it out.here how you thinking how you act and.how you feel is your personality and.your personality has a very direct.relationship with your personal reality.which means if you want to change your.personal reality if you want to change.something about your life you got to.change and.
