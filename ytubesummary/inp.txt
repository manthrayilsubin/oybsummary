that in general relativity you can have.a tunnel through the fabric of space.linking one location and the other.Einstein developed that idea too in 1935.just two months apart from quantum.entanglement for 90 years nobody thought.there was any connection between these.two ideas string theory has recently.revealed that it's very likely that.these two ideas are the same idea.described in different languages that.when you have two particles that are.quantum entangled in some sense there is.a tunnel through the fabric of space a.wormhole that is connecting them.[Music].together hello everybody I had the.opportunity and privilege today to speak.with Dr Brian Green who's a physicist.and an author of a number of books the.book we delved into most deeply today.was the elegant Universe super strings.hidden dimensions and the Quest for the.ultimate theory that was originally.published in 1999 but he's offering an.updated version as of 2024 and so we had.a chance to delve into the mysteries of.quantum mechanics special relativity and.string theory and string theory is a.branch of physics that was designed or.emerged to deal with the contradictions.that exist between general relativity.and quantum mechanics and so what did we.do in our discussion well we talked.about quantum mechanics and what it.means and signifies we talked about the.theory of general relativity we talked.about the nature of time and the nature.of entropy which is which are Concepts.that are quite tightly related we talked.about the infamous double slit theor um.experiment which is uh a mind twister to.say the least uh we talked about the.potential testing of string theory we.talked about what it has to offer and uh.what we we we talked about.Consciousness and the perception of time.and the relationship between the.perception of time and entropy and the.expansion of the universe and.uh and we talked about situating.that more.narrow pursuit of the truths of physics.in a what in a more broadly humanistic.Approach To The World At Large and so if.you're interested in the mysteries of.physics and the relationship between the.various deep theories of physics to one.another and trying to develop some.understanding of Cutting Edge inquiry in.that regard particularly with in.relationship to string theory let's say.then this is the conversation for you.and thanks to Dr Brian Green for.agreeing to put up with my questions and.and for sharing his deep.knowledge with me and my.viewers so Dr Green you've written a.number of books I think I'll just list.them and if I miss any I don't think I.will but if I do let me know until the.end of time that was 2020 light.falls 2016 the hidden reality 20.Icarus at the Edge of Time 2008 the.fabric of the cosmos.2004 and the elegant Universe super.strings hidden dimensions and the Quest.for the ultimate theory that was.published originally in 1999 but it's.been updated for 2024 and I guess that's.part of the occasion for our discussion.and so you you've been investigating and.popularizing uh Advanced physics for a.very long time and I guess we'll have an.opportunity to delve into that today so.I want to go through the elegant.Universe in some detail but if you don't.mind I'd like to take this opportunity.to ask you some questions that I've been.wanting to ask a theoretical physicist.for a long time and um and that'll help.me Rectify some holes in my.knowledge so the first I wanted to ask.you about two things that are related to.begin with one has to do with time and.and its relationship to entropy and I.just want to see if I understand that.relationship I have some specific.reasons for that because there are.attempts in the Neuroscience literature.to tie emotional processing both on the.positive and negative side to the.concept of entropy and I did some work.on that topic especially with negative.emotion in my lab and I want to make.sure that I actually understand the.underlying concept so and it should be.of some interest to the people who are.watching and listening so the first the.first question I have is is whether or.not it's reasonable to is there a.distinction between time and change I.mean my sense is that and this ties us.into the entropy discussion I guess to.some degree I mean my sense is is that.our perception of time.which is difficult to distinguishable.from time itself as a phenomenon our.perception of time is something like our.abstraction of average rates of change.and it also seems to me that in a system.where there's no change like a closed.system where there's no change there's.also no time and that time is something.like the walk through the multiple.states that a complex system can be in.and that that's essentially associated.with something with with entropy and now.is there anything wrong very close not.really at all okay I I I say that the.real the real challenge to give a.precise answer to your question which is.a good one the challenge is nobody has a.real definition of what the word time.actually means what it is the best that.we can do in physics is it that there is.some access there is some quality that.we can measure change by invoking much.as you just described we say that time.has elapsed because the system has.changed but is that a real definition of.time not not really it's a very.pragmatic approach in our equations we.have a little variable called T it's.introduced in basically all the.dynamical equations physics and yet we.are still struggling to figure out is it.something we impose from the outside.because it's a useful way of organizing.experience to have a temporal order to.things is it fundamentally written into.the laws of reality that there is this.thing called time might there be Realms.of reality where there is no time and.yet there's still something there that.we would call in existence so these are.the big tough questions that we've yet.to fully been able to Grapple with yeah.well I I saw Richard Dawkins recently.being interviewed by Pierce Morgan and.Pierce was struggling with the idea that.there was no time before the Big Bang.and that obviously violates our embodied.intuitions right which are strongly.tilted in the direction of presuming.time as a constant and but but I would.even say the framing of that question is.an interesting one because to talk about.before the Big Bang is to assume that.the notion of before is applicable in.that extraordinarily different realm of.existence in everyday life of course the.word before makes sense but when you get.right back to the Big Bang it could be.that this conception of time emerges.with that event and the Very concept of.before may be meaningless it's like you.know Steph Hawking had a great analogy.here which was because if you're walking.on planet Earth and you pass somebody.you tell ask them which way is North.they point you northward You Keep On.Walking you ask somebody else how do I.go further north they point you further.north as well when you get to the North.Pole and you say to somebody there how.do I go further north than the North.Pole they look at you quizzically.because it doesn't make any sense you've.reached the location on Earth where.North Begins the Big Bang could in.principle be the location in reality.where time begins and going further back.in time may be as nonsensical as going.further north than the North Pole well.this is exactly the the difficulty of.conceptualization that pierce was.struggling with and to me it's a lot.easier to understand that if you.understand that there is no fundamental.distinction between time and change and.so if time if the existence of time is.predicated let's say on the existence.not only of matter but of matter that's.changing.and you have a state where there's.either no matter or the matter that is.there is is not changing in any manner.the whole notion of time vanishes.because the phenomenon itself doesn't.exist and okay so all right so then let.me ask you about the idea of entropy a.little bit um.so I it's very difficult for me to.understand entropy except in.relationship to something like a a goal.so so let me let me lay out how this.might work.psychologically um uh Carl friston has.been working on this he's the world's.most cited neuroscientist and I.interviewed him relatively recently and.he has a notion of positive emotion.that's associated with entropy reduction.and um we our work has run parallel with.regards to the idea of anxiety as a.signal of entropy so imagine that you.have a a state of mind in mind that's a.a goal you just want to cross the street.that's a good simple uh that's a good.simple example.now imagine that what you're doing is.comparing the state that you're in now.you're on one side of the street to the.state that you want to be in which is.for your body to be on the other side of.the street and.and then you calculate the.Transformations that are necessary the.energy expenditure and the actions that.are necessary to transpose the one.condition into the state of the other.condition then you could imagine there's.path length between that right which.would be the number of operations.necessary to undertake the.transformation then you could imagine.that you could assign to each of those.Transformations something approximating.an energy and materials expenditure cost.and then you could determine whether the.advantage of being across the street.maybe it's closer to the grocery store.let's say whether the advantages.outweigh the.disadvantages okay now if You observe.yourself successfully taking steps that.shorten the path length across the.street that produces positive emotion.and that seems to be technically true.and then if something gets in your way.or an obstacle emerges or something.unexpected happens then that increases.the path length and costs you more.energy and resources and that produces.anxiety now the the the problem with.that from an entropy perspective is it.seems to make what constitutes entropy.dependent.on the the psychological nature of the.target like I don't exactly know how to.how to define one state as say more.entropic and maybe it doesn't make sense.more entropic than another except in.relationship to a like a perceived end.point I mean otherwise I mean I guess.you associate entropy with a random walk.through all the different configurations.that a body of material might take um at.a certain temperature it's something.like that and I would say it analogous.to that but a little bit different so.what we do is we look at the space of.all possible configurations of a system.whether it's a psychological system or.whether it's air molecules in a box it.doesn't really matter to us the way we.humans interpret that system we simply.look at the particles that make up the.system and we divide up the space of all.possible configurations into regions.that from a macroscopic perspective are.largely indistinguishable right the air.in this room it doesn't matter to me.whether that oxygen moleculees in that.corner or that corner it would be.indistinguishable butun was in a little.functionally equivalent but if all the.air was in a little ball right over here.and none was left for me to breathe then.I would certainly know the difference.between that configuration of the gas.and the one that I'm actually inhabiting.at the moment so they would belong to.different regions of this configuration.space which I divide up into blobs that.macroscopically are indistinguishable.and we simply Define the entropy in some.sense to be the volume of that region so.high entropy means there are a lot of.states that more or less look the same.like the gas in this room right now but.if the gas was in a little ball would.have lower entropy because there far.fewer rearrangements of those.constituents that look the same as the.ball of gas so it's a very.straightforward mathematical exercise to.enumerate the entropy of a configuration.by figuring out which of the regions it.belongs to but none of that involves the.psychological states that you make.reference to now there may be.interesting analogies interesting poetic.resonances interesting rhyming between.the things that one is interested in.from a psychological perspective and.from a physics perspective but the.beauty or the downfall depending how you.look at it of the way we Define things.in physics we kind of strip away the.psycholog logical we strip away the.Observer dependent qualities we strip.away the interpretive aspects in order.to just have a numerical value of.entropy that we can associate to a given.configuration so we could start by.talking.about depression.depressed people are sad and frustrated.and disappointed they tend to feel all.negative emotions simultaneously in a.manner that's.paralyzing depression is fundamentally a.biochemical disorder one of the things I.tried to determine as a good behaviorist.was whether the person who was suffering.was suffering because they were ill in.the strictly physiological sense or.whether they were suffering uffing from.the cumulative micro and macro.catastrophes of.Life the probability that tossing an.anti-depressant into the mix is all of a.sudden going to fix your life that are.absolutely catastrophically out of order.is zero the more unstable your life is.the less serotonin your brain produces.and that makes you hyp sensitive to.negative emotion and suppresses positive.emotion.you take the problem I'm suffering and.then you think well why are you.suffering it's exposure therapy and then.you can practice encountering the.obstacles that are stopping you and.it'll make you braver and it'll help you.deal with your problems voluntary.confrontation with the forces of.darkness and chaos is the fundamental.story of.[Music].life right well what you're trying to do.when you control a situation.psychologically is to specify the I.suppose it's something like specifying.the entropy right because you're trying.to calculate the number of states that.the situation that you're in now could.conceivably occupy if you undertook an.appropriate uh what would you say an.appropriate course of action and as long.as while you're specifying that course.of action the system maintains its.desired Behavior then it's it's not for.example it's not anxiety-provoking and.you can presume that you're course of.action is functional and and I say if.that proves to be if that proves to be a.valuable definition to acquire insight.into perhaps human behavior the.psychological reasons for crossing that.street as you were describing before.then that may be valuable within that.environment the reason why we find.entropy valuable as physicists is we.like to be able to figure out the.general way in which systems evolve over.time.and when the systems are very.complicated again be it gas in this room.or the molecules inside of our heads.it's simply too complicated for us to.actually do the molecule by molecule.calculation of how the particles are.going to move from today until tomorrow.instead we have learned from the work of.people like boltzman and and Gibbs and.people of that nature a long time ago.we've learned that if you take a step.back and view the system as a.statistical Ensemble as an average it's.much easier to figure out on average how.the system will evolve over time systems.tend to go from low entropy to high.entropy from order toward disorder and.we can make that quite precise in the.mathematical articulation and that.allows us to understand overall how.systems will change through time without.having to get into the detailed.microscopic.calculations okay so there's some.lications from that as far as I can tell.one is that time itself is is in is a.macroscopic.phenoma and.then the other the see there there's.times when it seems to me and correct me.if I'm wrong that you're moving.something like a psychological frame of.reference into the.physical uh conceptualizations because.for example you you described a.situation where if there was a room full.of.air one of the potential configurations.is that all the air molecules are.clustered in one corner at at least it's.denser there now it's going to be the.case that on average the vast majority.of possible configurations of molecules.in of air molecules in a room are going.to uh be characterized by something.approximating uh random dispersement and.so that fraction of potential.configurations where there's uh what.would you say there's uh differences in.average density are going to be rare but.what you you you did say that you use.the term ordered and I'm guess I'm.wondering if there is a.physical definition for.order because the the the the.configuration.where there's density differences is has.a certain probability it's very low but.it has a certain probability there isn't.anything necessarily that marks it out.as distinct from the rest of the.configurations except its comparative.Rarity and but you can't Define any.given configuration as differentially.rare because every single configuration.is equally rare so how does the concept.of.order how how do you how do you clarify.the concept of order from from the.perspective of pure physics yes and and.so you're absolutely right when you.begin to delineate configurations that.you describe as ordered or disordered.low entropy or high entropy It Is by.virtue of seeing the group to which they.belong as opposed to analyzing them as.individuals on their own terms and when.we invoke words like order and disorder.obviously those are human.psychologically developed terms and and.where does it come from it comes from.the following basic fact which is if you.have a situation that typically we.humans would call ordered for instance.if you have books on a shelf that are.all.alphabetical there are very few ways.that the books can meet that Criterion.in fact if you're talking about making.them alphabetical there's only one.configuration that will meet that very.string definition of order you could.have other definitions of order like all.the blue ones are here and all the red.covers are here then there's a few you.can mix up the blues you can mix up the.Reds but you can't mix them together so.again you have a definition of ordered.disordered is when you can have any of.those configurations at all so clearly.an ordered configuration is one that's.harder to achieve it's more special it.differs from the random configur.configuration that would arise in its.own right if you weren't imposing any.other restrictions and so that's why we.use those words but you're absolutely.right those words are of human orig and.they do.require yeah it's partly improbability.and Rarity and then the while the.emotional component seems to come in in.that it's not only rare and unlikely but.it also has some degree of functional.significance I mean the reason that you.alphabetize your books is so that you.can find them and so it's a rare.configuration that has functional.utility and that's and that's not a bad.definition of order but the problem with.that from a purely physical perspective.is it's definition that involves some.subjective element of of analysis so.that's that's fine it does and this has.bother but I should say this has.bothered physicists for a very long time.that when you invoke the notion of.entropy unlike most other laws in.physics like you know Einstein's.equations of general relativity or.Newton's equations for the motion of.objects you can write down the symbols.everybody knows exactly what they means.and you can simply apply them and start.with a given configuration and figure.out definitively what it will look like.later entropy and thermodynamics and.statistical mechanics which is the area.of physics that we're talking about here.is of a different character because for.instance the second law of.thermodynamics that speaks about the.increase of entropy going from order to.disorder you know your books are nice.and alphabetized but you pull them out.you start to put them back and you're.going to lose the alphabetical order.unless you're very careful about putting.the books back in it's more likely that.you get to this disordered state where.they're no longer alphabetized in the.future but that's not a law that's a.statistical tendency it is absolutely.possible for systems to violate the.second law of Thermodynamics it's just.High improbable if I take a if I take a.handful of sand and I drop it on the.beach most of the time it's just going.to Splatter and move those sand.particles all over the surface but on.occasion is it possible that I drop that.handful of sand and it lands in a.beautiful sand castle statistically.unlikely probabilistically unlikely but.could it happen yes and if it did that.would be going from a disorder to an.ordered State violating the second law.of Thermodynamics so that that's why.this law is of a different character.than what we are used to in physics yeah.well that's what we've been trying to.wrestle with to some degree on the.neural science and and so so okay so let.me ask you another question it it's it's.probably obvious to you but I just also.want to make sure that I've got it right.is that there there is a widespread.consensus let's.say that the universe is expanding and.is there is there any difference between.that proclivity for the universe to.expand and the and and time itself and.also more specifically the forward.direction of time like is is the.expansion of the universe the macro.equivalent of the arrow of time at the.more micro and subjective level some.people have thought so there was a time.even when Steven Hawking a while ago.made a claim of a similar sounding sort.currently we do not believe so we have.theoretical models in which the universe.can expand and even then contract even.though the direction of time has not.reversed when the rate or direction of.expansion has changed and so the idea.that the way in which the universe.expands is intrinsically tied to the.arrow of time is not one that is.currently at all in favor in fact the.the is isue of the arrow of time is one.of the big perplexing questions which we.can only at the moment give the.following answer to when you're talking.cosmologically if entropy is meant to.increase toward the future than just.running it backward you'd think that.entropy must have been lower in the past.and if you take that directive and you.push it to its limits it would suggest.that at the Big Bang entropy was in a.real really low value really ordered.State now that's confusing because a we.don't really know how the universe came.into existence but B if it's so ordered.you ask yourself how did it get so.ordered I mean when the books on the.shelf or alphabetized we know how they.got ordered some intelligent being came.along you or me or my kid and put the.books in alphabetical order but if the.moment of creation was so highly ordered.the question is who did that or what did.that or what's the origin of this order.and this is a vital question because if.the Big Bang was not highly ordered if.it was disordered if it had high entropy.there'd be no opportunity for ordered.structures like stars and planets and.life forms to ever exist so we owe our.existence to the apparent fact that the.Big Bang was highly ordered given the.opportunity for ordered structures to.then emerge as the the unfolding and.change what's the relationship okay I.have two questions on that front then.what's the relationship between the.ordered State at the hypothetical big.bang and the emergence of order on the.cosmological and Galactic level.following the big bang I don't.understand that relationship and then so.that's one question the other question.is you know I read um A Brief History of.Time a long time ago um so I have I want.to ask a couple of questions about that.so when the universe is Contracting.within Hawkings model there is this.proclivity as you just pointed out for.everything to move from a state of.relative disorder and dispersal to a.state of relative order and Hawking.seemed to imply in that book that that.meant that the arrow of time was running.backwards but I but that puzzled me in.in two ways and one would be that there.could still be all sorts of random.perturbations and systems that were.collapsing and the other is that it.seems to me that the notion of quantum.uncertainty also disproves the idea that.the time of the arrow of time would run.backwards in some deterministic way.because there's no so okay so that's the.question on the Hawking side so yep so.let me to answer those in reverse order.because it's it's worthwhile noting that.Hawking himself changed his mind on this.point regarding the reversal of the.arrow of time upon contraction so much.of your concern with that is actually.borne out by our views as well so nobody.really takes seriously this idea anymore.that the arrow of time would reverse but.the first question of how do you get the.ordered structures like stars and.galaxies from this big bang beginning is.a is a deep one and I believe that we.have some insight into that which more.or less goes like this the Big Bang.happens Universe starts swelling rapidly.and the energy that drove that expansion.then disintegrates into a bath of.particles that fill space now you might.think about the particles filling space.that sounds disordered that sounds.really high entropy like the gas in this.room the particles are filled out.through the room perhaps things would.just stay that way and there would never.be clumps of particles and what changes.is When Gravity matters and it does on.cosmological scales it doesn't matter in.this room gravity is irrelevant to the.air molecules in this room but gravity.does matter if you have enough particles.filling space and that certainly happens.with the universe as a whole and what.that means is gravity starts to pull.little inhomogeneties a little denser.knot of particles here a little less.dense over here the denser one starts to.pull in more particles it gets denser.still and because it's denser its.gravitational pull is yet stronger and.it pulls in more particles and ultim you.get these locations where particles.begin to implode in on themselves.getting hotter and denser ultimately.igniting nuclear processes and a star is.born and the beautiful thing about this.and this is incredibly subtle but the.beautiful thing is this formation of the.star is indeed a drop in entropy a star.is more ordered than the original.configurations but in the formation of.the star the star gives off heat and.light that emits entropy to The Wider.environment I like to call this the.entropic twostep entropy goes down in.the formation of the star but it goes up.in the wider environment and overall the.entropic balance works the overall.entropy goes up even though you get a.pocket of order in the wake of that.entropic increase okay human beings do.that too exactly that's what we do right.so you know we eat food we take in these.orderly sources of energy we burn that.fuel to allow biological processes to.take place keeping our entropy low but.in the process we give off heat we expel.waste and if you take account of that.then the overall entropy of us and the.environment does go up but our entropy.is able to kind of thumb its nose at the.second law of Thermodynamics at least.while we're living and are able to keep.our entropy.stable go going online without Express.VPN is like not paying attention to the.safety demonstration on a flight most of.the

me ask you a question.about that in initial.clumping um it it occurred to me um I'm.sure this isn't an original idea that so.if that initial state that initial State.immediately after the big bang can't be.homogeneous perfectly homogeneous.because Quantum uncertainty with regards.to the positioning of the particles.would mean that there would be some lack.of homogeneity and the explanation you.gave seems to imply that even minor.deviations in homogeneity would start a.clumping process um would begin the.clumping process and then once it starts.it's going to it's going to capitalize.on itself and so is it is is it is the.lack of homogeneity after the big bang a.direct consequence of quantum.uncertainty with regards to the position.of the particles it is it is that's.exactly right and it's even more than.just an interesting idea what we've been.able to do and these are calculations.that go back to the 1980s we've been.able to model the early universe.mathematically using quantum physics.using Einstein's general relativity and.we've been able to.calculate how the uncertainty in the.positions and the energies and the.speeds of the particles should affect.the environment and we've been able to.calculate that it should cause tiny in.homogeneities as well in the temperature.of the night sky in the temperature of.space which means that if you could.measure the temperature of the night sky.to adequate Precision you should be able.to test the prediction and this is what.we have been able to do with the.so-called Cosmic microwave background.radiation this is heat left over from.The Big Bang and starting in the 199 90s.with ever greater Precision we've used.space telescopes and other devices to.measure the temperature of space and the.agreement between the theoretical.predictions and the observations is so.incredibly accurate that to see the.error bars in the measurements you have.to magnify them by like a factor of 500.so that the naked eye can even see them.on the graph that's how tightly there is.an agreement between the mathematical.calculations that we humans do these.little biological systems crawling.around this planet barely coming of age.in the Milky Way galaxy been able to.calculate conditions billions of years.ago and compare them to observations and.they agreed to spectacular Precision.this is one of the great triumphs of.modern science I see so you could detect.lack of homogeneity in the background.temperature and that was also indicative.of lack of H homogeneity in terms of.dispersal of particle dens.exactly oh wow okay that's very cool all.right so that is so that's so.interesting because that implies as well.that that or indicates that Quantum.uncertainty makes it impossible for.there to be a homogeneous distribution.of particles it's there going to be.there's going to be asymmetries emerge.and those asymmetries right and then the.asymmetries expand up until they.manifest themselves at a cosmological.level with stars and galaxies yes and.those large filaments that the galaxies.appear to congregate in and wow okay so.that's how that we are we are the we are.the progeny we are the progeny of.quantum uncertainty RIT large Across the.Universe right right right okay okay so.all right let me if you don't mind I.have one other specific question before.I turn to maybe the more particular.details of of your of your work.especially with regards to string theory.so you know I've I've been perplexed.like so many people with the double slit.EXP experiment and the fact that if you.I'll just review it for people very.briefly if you shine light through a uh.uh say a cardboard sheet that has slits.in it and you put a photographic plate.behind it you can produce interference.patterns that are uh that you can.capture with with the photographic.Emulsion and uh the hypothesis is that.when the light beams go through the.slits they interfere with one another.and so you get these variegated zebra.like patterns on the photographic.Emulsion but the peculiar thing about.that setup is that if you slow the.transmission of the light through the.slits down to one Photon per unit of.time so that there's only one Photon.being admitted you still get the.interference patterns okay so so I had a.thought about that and I want you to.correct it if if it's wrong or or.indicate if it's right so my.understanding is that as that at the.speed of light the universe is flat.perpendicular to the direction of the.travel of the light beam and that there.is no time and so is it not fair to say.that from the perspective of the photons.like from our perspective we're firing.one Photon at a time but from the.perspective of the light beam the light.beams.there's no difference between the one.Photon at a time State and.the and the shining a light beam that's.composed of an indefinite number of.photons at the same time if there's no.time from the perspective of the light.beam that it's all the same to the light.whether it's one Photon at a time or or.a plethora of light now so I don't.exactly understand what that means.because I can't understand the.difference between the time free frame.of reference that the light beam has and.and.our expansion of that but it it it is.there something wrong in my Reckoning.with regards to the idea that that time.is collapsed and so it's irrelevant from.the perspective of the light well what I.would say there is that from a poetic.sensibility if you apply Einstein's.special theory of relativity to the.frame of reference of a photon then the.things that you say are correct but I.always caution my students against.taking that perspective because what.you're ultimately doing is you're.infusing the photon with the very things.that we care about such as time and.space and interference patterns but the.photon doesn't have any capacity to care.about those things like the photon.doesn't have any conscious experience.what we want to do is explain our.experiences in our frame of reference.and in our frame of reference Photon.upon Photon upon Photon do have temporal.separations so while while it's kind of.Minds slapping to imagine yourself in.the perspective of a photon it's not a.perspective that any material object can.ever have the special thing about a.photon is that it's massless and only.massless objects can ever achieve the.speed of light and that's why us and.Mater objects will never have that.perspective so if we want to explain the.things that we encounter the things that.we experience we have to use a frame of.reference that is not moving at the.speed of light in the manner that you.described and so if it offers some sort.of poetic insight to imagine that.there's no time from the point of view.of a photon there's no space it's all.been Loren contracted infinitely far.these are actually pushing Einstein's.ideas a little too far poetically you.can do it but Einstein's der ation of.time dilation and Loren contraction it.all was from the perspective of a.massive body that was not itself.traveling at light speed right well I.guess the the the reason I was thinking.along those lines wasn't so much at.least as far as I was concerned for.poetic reasons but to explain the fact.that the interference actually still.happens if if the reality and not merely.subjective reality if the reality that.the photon is operating in lacks the.temporal dimension because it's.contracted then of course it's going to.the.interference um the interference.phenomenon is still going to make itself.manifest and that seems to me maybe I'm.misunderstanding you but that seems to.me to be more than merely poetic it.seems to me to be an explanation for why.the for why the interference phenomena.still makes itself manifest it's all.happening at the same time as far as the.from the I I don't mean the subjective.perspective of the light beam because as.you pointed out that's preposterous and.because it doesn't have a perspective.but it still is interacting with its.other with the with the other photons in.that in that setup because the temporal.Dimension is collapsed and that seems to.be an explanation go ahead but again.it's pushing Einstein's special.relativity to a place that it doesn't.technically apply so when Einstein.derived all of the ideas that you're.implicitly making use of that there's.this thing called time delay which.becomes infinitely big at light speed or.this thing called Lorent contraction.that becomes you know infinitely small.at light speed Einstein's derivation.only worked for speeds that were less.than the speed of light not equal to the.speed of light so there's a technical.glitch and trying to actually push that.idea through and so what we have been.forced to do is stick with the.perspective that we actually have in the.laboratory and try to explain what we.see which is utterly bizarre as you set.it up that individual photons that are.encountering this barrier with the two.openings somehow still produce this.interference pattern that is a WAV like.phenomenon but what does it mean to have.a wave when you've got one particle.right that's the big puzzle and the.solution that we've come to is that.individual particles do themselves have.a WAV like quality an unexpected one.it's a Quantum wave that was introduced.by the great thinkers in the early part.of the 20th century beginning with.Einstein and then Neils Bor and wner.Heisenberg and Iran Stringer and Max.Bourne and Paul D and all the people who.developed these ideas but the bottom.line is individual particles have a.spread out wavelike quality and that.wave is not an electromagnetic wave it's.not a wave of light if it's a photon say.rather it's a probability Wave It's a.wave that no one had ever anticipated.arising in our understanding of the.physical world the idea being the best.you can ever do is predict the.likelihood of the probability of a.particle being here or here or there.unlike what Newton would have said.Newton would have said just tell me.where the particle is in how fast it's.moving right now and I'll use my math to.tell you exactly where it will be later.on and quantum physics had to turn to.Newton and say you're asking for an.impossibility you can't tell where a.particle is and how fast it's moving.there's Quantum uncertainty and the best.you can do because of that is predict.probabilities of a particle being one.place or another right okay so so let me.delve into that a little bit I know.that's like impossibly incomprehensible.in a in a in a way but the the wave that.you're describing as a probability wave.that's the possibility that a given.phenomena let's say speed and location.might make itself manifest but it's it's.indeterminate there's some circumstances.under which it's.indeterminate and I don't exactly.understand the circumstances under which.it's indeterminate in conventional.quantum mechanics it would be all.situations conventional quantum.mechanics would say you physicists or.you human beings you're asking for too.much your intuition based on everyday.experience has misled you into thinking.that you can talk about the position and.the speed of objects you can't you can.talk about one or the other or you can.talk approximately about each but you.can't delineate both simultaneous with.total Precision it's simply can't be.done you've been misled by Common.experience macroscopic experience.macroscopic experience is a completely.misleading guide to how the microscopic.World works and you know we really.shouldn't be too surprised by that why.should it be the case that the things.that we experience in everyday life also.govern the incredibly small or the.incredibly big and turns out that they.don't but I will say one thing just on.the side there are alternative ways of.talking about quantum physics and.articulating it mathematically that have.not achieved the kind of widespread.acceptance as the version that I'm.relying upon in our conversation here.and in some of those alternative.versions which are perfectly good they.make the same predictions you have a.situation where you can delineate a.particle speed and position they are.determinate the indeterminacy comes into.the equations in a different manner so.this is an approach that was developed.by David B it was developed by Louis de.Bry it got completely ignored in the.history of quantum physics for the most.part there are some people who think.about it today but I only raise this to.say even with a subject like quantum.physics which we can now use to make.predictions that agree with experiments.to nine or 10 decimal PL places that's.how precise these ideas are there's.still an interpretive quality there's.still a struggling to make sense of what.it is that it's really telling us about.reality and there are alternate versions.that are out there right now that in.principle are each as good as the other.in the minds of their different.proponents right right so it's useful to.keep in mind the fact that those.interpretive that there's a variety of.opinions with regards to yeah the.plethora of interpretive Frameworks that.might be appropriate so yeah there is a.dominant there's a dominant one I don't.want to give an incorrect view most.physicists who you talk to will speak in.the manner that we were a moment to go.but I always feel that it's worthwhile.pointing out that that's not the only.way that you can talk about quantum.physics in today's chaotic World many of.us are searching for a way to aim higher.and find spiritual peace but here's the.thing prayer the most common tool we.have isn't just about saying whatever.comes to mind it's a skill that needs to.be developed that's where hallow comes.in as the number one prayer and.meditation app hallow is launching

hall.com Jordan.elevate your prayer life.today do you this is a very ill formed.question um and it it it sort of pushes.me to the edge of my understanding I've.spent a lot of time studying mythology.and um the ordering effect of.Consciousness is something that's.represented in deep.narratives.universally and the story is something.like an ordering agent encountering a.field of possibility and casting it into.a determinant and and somewhat fixed.order so for example in the Genesis.account the uh the waste and Chaos that.the spirit of God encounters is the toou.vabo and it's it's something like a.field of potential and I've been curious.about that about the relationship.between that and these ideas at a.Quantum level that the ground of reality.at the most fundamental material Level.starts to become something other than.the determinant particles of dust that.we're familiar with from our day-to-day.experience that it's something like a.realm.of Realm isn't precisely the right word.but I'll use it because I don't have a.better one a realm of Poss possibility.that can be cast into the actuality of.the present and the past and so I'm.wondering how you understand that that.wave you know you were careful to.distinguish it from the electromagnetic.wave form and you're talking about it as.a if I understand it correctly as a.field of possibility a field of of of.actualizable possibility that exists in.potential whatever that means before.it's actualized into an actual event and.so how how do you or do you understand.that field of possibility and what.existential or phenomenological.significance might that have do do you.have any sense of what that might.mean it's a deep and very difficult.question and let me just give you a.little bit of insight as to why it's so.difficult that may not be obvious from.what we've discussed so far if we have a.single particle of Photon or electron we.can talk about its probability wave as.existing in ordinary three dimensions.because after all telling us the.possible the potential locations that.that particle might occupy and of course.those locations exist in three.dimensions but if you have two particles.that wave doesn't now exist in three.dimensions it exists in Six Dimensions.because there are three locations where.the first particle might be and they.three coordinates I should say that.would delineate the location of the.second par so three coordinates for the.first three coordinates for the second.if you have three particles that wave.lives in nine Dimensions four particles.it lives in 12.Dimensions you know if you have a.trillion particles that wave lives in.three trillion D how do you think about.that wave so that wave as something that.for one particle is at least It's Tricky.but at least you can envision it as you.know some gossamer substance that's.filling space and where that gossamer.substance is a little bit you know more.opaque high probability where it's.thinner low you can think about you can.cogitate on that I don't know how to.cogitate on the version that describes.many particles because it's beyond my.capacity to Envision the arena within.which that wave exists so it's a tough.tough question and and sort of the way.it relates at least the way I try to.make it relate to the kinds of topics.that you were speaking of be it the.Bible be it mythology I sort of see.reality as stated stratified into.different layers that all relate to each.other and you need to choose the right.language the right story if you will to.gain insight into whatever layer you're.interested in and if you're interested.in the Rock Bottom reality quantum.physics is where you should absolutely.go if you're interested in the layer.where particles come together into.molecules well that's more chemistry how.they come together into cells more.biology how they come together into.living systems you know then you get.into self-consciousness neurology psych.I mean so you see all these nested.stories are they Reliant upon quantum.physics in the Rock Bottom reality they.are but the language that's more useful.at the higher levels of course is the.higher level language that we invoke and.so you know to me.mythology is this wonderful realm where.we human beings have struggled to find.coherence at the societal level to try.to understand our own mortality to try.to understand where we came from and.where we're going not from general.relativity but from a more human.standpoint and so that's where I see.those stories interfacing with the.cosmological and quantum mechanical.story okay so so you you talked about.the difficulty of mapping that three.trillion in dimension space let's say.that that emerges as a consequence of.the interaction of a plethora of of.particles I mean it it seems to me that.that's actually and this is a huge leap.and I'm not claiming it's correct but.there's something to it because of.course I'll lay it out first I mean we.we use imaginative projection to.Envision alternative potential Futures.right and we seem to concentrate on the.ones that are relatively statistically.likely like when you're i' I've been.thinking a lot about how Consciousness.operates and you know you can think of.us as deterministic creatures who are.driven by mechanical algorithms to move.forward robotically lock step as we're.driven by material causality but um you.can also think about us as uh imagin.Visionaries who flesh out Realms of.possibility and.then Implement processes to bring those.about and I think the.latter conceptualization is much more.accurate with regards to the contents of.our Consciousness because what.Consciousness focuses.on isn't constants Consciousness focuses.on variability so for example if.something unexpected happened in your.sensory field right at the moment you.would Orient towards it and you do that.well implicitly but your Consciousness.would focus on the the uncertainty and.the variability and so we seem to use.Consciousness to shape variability and.so I guess the first thing I'm wondering.is is it reasonable to suppose that the.purpose of the imagination is to map out.that dimensional multi-dimensional space.with regards to its most likely.configurations and the second question.is.this is a more oblique question is that.like is it reasonable to assume that the.possibility that Consciousness appears.to be contending to like the field of.possibility that opens up to your.imagination let's say when you wake up.in the morning and start to apprehend.the possibilities of the day is that a.manifestation of the what it's is that a.manifestation of that is it a higher.level manifestation of that field.possibility that characterizes the the.micro realm you know you know what I.mean there's possibility at the quantum.level does that.possibility make itself manifest all the.way up to to the to the level of macro.experience because we seem to be dealing.with something like possibility rather.than deterministic algorithmic actuality.and so there definitely is a a rhyming.between the two kinds of ideas for sure.but how is it that quantum physics at.that Rock Bottom story bubbles up and.influences conscious experience I don't.know and nobody does it's too complex a.problem right now but what I would say.is there are things about Consciousness.that The Rock Bottom story does give.insight into and one of the big ones is.Free Will right I mean there have been.arguments about Free Will going on for.thousands of years and to me it's quite.clear.that when you recognize if you believe.that the physical is all that there is.and I don't know that that is the case.but let's just take that as an.assumption for the moment that there's.no consciousness field that's out there.in the world that we somehow are tapping.into that there's no greater power.that's somehow beyond the laws of.physics if all we are are bags of.particles governed by physical law and.our brains are nothing but Gloppy three.pound collections of particles that are.organized sufficiently to somehow yield.the information processing that we call.conscious awareness if that's all that.it is and I think that is all that it is.then there's no opportunity for us to.have any freedom of the will because our.particles are going to do what they're.going to do governed by the quantum laws.and there's no opportunity for an i to.intercede in that lawful if.probabilistic projection so that's just.the way things work and so the view that.we can somehow cause our particles.perhaps to hold still for a moment wait.wait wait for Brian to make a decision.and once Brian makes a decision then.carry on with whatever motion that you.were going to do by the laws of physics.that's incoherent that's ludicrous and.so however much we may feel that we are.the ultimate authors of our actions I.don't see any opportunity for that.because we can't intercede in the lawful.progression of the particles that govern.whether I move my arm whether I say this.or I say that it's all just the motion.of particles that are in iated in my.biological form do you feel that what.what's your opinion about.okay you can make causally determinant.arguments very far very high up the.resolution.uh what what spectrum so the more the.more macro the system the more.deterministic processes seem to be at.play but when you push all the way down.to the micro.level you have this fundamental.indeterminacy and so why would you.presume that the deterministic argument.holds true given that at its most.fundamental basis there's indeterminacy.you know is isn't it the case that if.you wanted to make an algorithmic case.that you'd need like predictable.algorithmic causality all the way from.the most micro levels all the way up or.or are you making the case that once you.get to the macro level the determinacy.takes over to the point where there is.no possibility for such a thing as free.will no I think that the.indeterminacy of quantum physics turns.out to be irrelevant to the particular.story that I'm telling in the following.sense so what what I'm I'm not saying.that we are determinate in the sense.that I can't predict what you're going.to do next because you are ultimately a.Quantum system let me look re right down.at the level of your particles imagine I.could zoom in on you and see your.individual particles the best I can do.is predict the likelihood or the.probability that those particles are.going to evolve from one configuration.to another through time but that.probabilistic prediction that.uncertainty that's not freedom of your.will you aren't controlling which.outcome happens you aren't determining.which outcome is more likely or less.likely you still are just going along.for this probabilistic ride and so.whether physics is probabilistic as.quantum mechanics says or in the.classical determinate view that Isaac.Newton would have said we know it's the.former not the latter but even in the.former you aren in controlling that.uncertainty and therefore you aren't.controlling how things are unfolding you.aren't controlling what you do or what.you say at that fundamental level so you.are nothing but this collection of.particles still fully govern governed by.laws which I should say the quantum laws.as mathematical equations they are as.deterministic as the classical laws but.what they determine are likelihoods.probabilities and so once those.probabilities are determined by.mathematics you are out of the equation.and that's the way in which you don't.have the freedom of will that you feel.that you.do attention men who still believe in.the American dream in a world gone add.the Precision

instead.available now at Jeremy razer.com.walmart.com and Amazon.Prime MH okay yeah I understand the.argument yes of course the the classic.what would you say rejoiner to that is.that you know we structure and I don't.know how to reconcile the two you know I.I'm not claiming that I do in the least.but you know we structure our societies.on the presumption of something.approximating responsible Free Will and.in so far as we do that we seem to be.able to hold people responsible help.them govern their behaviors integrate.them psychologically and produce stable.communities and so it's very strange.situation that the presumption of Free.Will seems to be a pragmatic and.metaphysical necessity but it's hard to.square with the kind of modeling that.emerges well in your argument either.from a more Newtonian deterministic view.of physics or even from the Quantum View.you know it's a gap that's I think I.have an answer I think I have an answer.to that but these are difficult issues.so I don't by any means think it's all.settled but I still think that in a.world of the sort that I've describe.which I think is our world I think you.still bear responsibility for your.actions it's of a slightly different.nature than the responsibility in a.world that does have freedom of the will.but if you are the causal actor that.results in a certain effect if you are.part of the causal chain that results in.certain things happening then you are.responsible for the things happen.because you are a link in the causal.chain and the closer your link is to the.outcome the more responsibility you bear.so what does that mean for atic right.right I see exactly and so so my view on.punishment from a societal perspective.is it can't be from the standpoint of.Retribution that would seem to require.free will if you're going to actually.take a punitive stance on someone's.Behavior but rather I think punishment.should be viewed as shaping future.behaviors based upon current action.I mean the example that I like to use to.sort of take this out of the emotional.realm of human beings imagine you have a.Roomba many of us do that cleans your.floor right that Roomba doesn't have.free will that's not controversial And.yet when that Roomba bounces or bangs.into Furniture it's intern if it's a.high-end version it modifies its.internal map of the space in order that.subsequently it doesn't bump into things.it doesn't do the wrong thing in the.future and so you can update your your.program you can update your behavior.based upon getting feedback and so if.punishment is viewed as feedback in.order to shape future Behavior then yes.we should punish people that are.responsible in the manner that I just.described for things that we view as.transgressing the rules that we.collectively have brought into existence.for society to be able to function we're.not punishing them because we're coming.from a standpoint of Retribution we're.coming from a standpoint of shaping.future Behavior right right so yeah so.that's a more behaviorist.conceptualization of the utility of.punishment the necessity of punishment.all right well I think I'll leave that I.think what we'll do now if if it's okay.with you is um turn to string theory and.I mean I'm I'm so ignorant about string.theory that it's kind of miracle and I.guess so I can I'm going to start by.asking you some basic questions I guess.the first question you know you touch.upon this in in the the second edition.of your 1999 book which is um the.elegant Universe super strings hidden.dimensions in the Quest for ultimate.Theory you've just updated that and uh.you open the book uh by explaining I.suppose the at least part of the problem.that string theories hypothetically.poised to solve and at least to some.degree that's the uh lack of unity.between the theories of general.relativity and the theories of the of.the Quant.of the quantum physicists and so maybe.you could explain to us first what it.means that those theories aren't unified.like what that means yeah what that.means in the scientific realm but also.what it means practically and then walk.us through how String Theory what string.theory is and how it constitutes a.potential solution to that uh to that.conundrum yeah so the two big.discoveries of the 20th century are.Einstein's general theory of relativity.which describes the force of gravity and.as we discussed before the force of.gravity matters when things are big.stars and galaxies in the whole universe.and in that domain Einstein's ideas have.been tested and they do an incredible.job of explaining things that we see in.the heavens the other big development.which we've spent some time already.talking about is quantum physics which.describes the Small Things molecules.atoms subatomic particles and in that.domain quantum physics has itself been.tested to incredible precision and it.works the crazy thing is in any.situation where you need to put quantum.physics and general relativity together.when you need to use the equations in.tandem you get.nonsensical results you get results like.Infinity is the only answer that you.ever get for any question that you pose.now you might say well do you ever need.to put them together quantum mechanics.is small general relativity is Big those.seem pretty separate but there are.extreme Realms like the center of a.black hole where a lot of mass has been.crushed to a very small size big Mass.general relativity small size quantum.physics or the Big Bang the entire.observable universe crushed to a very.small size a lot of mass energy small.size again you need general relativity.and quantum mechanics and so in those.extreme Realms you find that the.equations simply fall apart the laws of.general relativity laws of quantum they.do not play to well together they are.ferocious antagonists and that's the.problem that we've been trying to and.that produces these mathematical.absurdities that you've been describing.and interferes with our understanding I.guess there's the aesthetic problem too.which is that we're possessed by the.strong intimation that all forms of.descriptive knowledge should unify at.least not exist in contradiction to one.another that seems well it seems to.violate I don't know our understanding.of what understanding itself is and so.that's okay okay and so well so can you.give us a maybe a more tangible.indication of what s sort of absurdities.Might emerge in the conceptual realm.when you're dealing with something like.the the situation that obtains in a.black hole and you said that the the.equations will produce references to.Infinity continually which seem to be.non-helpful but that's still pretty.abstract for people who aren't math.atically oriented is there a way of.simplifying that so that it's more.graspable yeah so for imag imagine you.jump into a black hole inadvisable but.imagine you do it we know that as you.get closer and closer to the center of.the black hole things will start to feel.uncomfortable if you jumped in feet.first your feet are going to be pulled.more strongly than your head so your.body is going to stretch it's going to.spaghettify we call it ultimately it's.going to be pulled apart into its.constituents and those constituents are.then going to fall toward the center and.the Deep question is what finally.happens when you actually reach the.center and if you ask any physicists.today for the answer they would be.forced to tell you if they're honest we.don't know we just don't know what.happens at the center of the black hole.some ideas are it's a portal to another.universe that's a wild sci-fi sounding.idea it be wonderful it's the case but.we just don't know some people think.it's a location where time comes to an.end it's just where there's no notion of.time any further so these are the things.that we just don't know how to answer so.I have I have a question about that too.well my correct me if I'm wrong about.this but my understanding is that as.something falls into a black hole and.this is from the perspective of an.external Observer as it falls it it it's.transforming more and more slowly and.that that trans.decreases in in speed until it's really.at a standstill and so so that and so.I'm I'm wondering if that's the case and.that there's that time de delation.that's accompanied by descent into a.black.hole I'm I'm I'm trying to put like.vague imaginations here imaginings.together you have something that's very.very dense at the center of that and you.also have the time dilation process is.it and and you have the idea that at.some distant point in the future.everything is going to come back.together in a big crunch at least that's.one of the hypothesis like is there any.difference.between the destination point when a.given body is falling into a given black.hole and the Big Crunch itself like is.that destination point the same.destination point andan that would.account to some degree for the kind of.infinite density at at the center of the.black hole and it seems to make sense if.if time is dilating to that.degree that's the best I can do it's a.good question and certainly you're right.from the standpoint of an outside.Observer watching say you jump into a.black hole they will see you move slower.and slower as you reach the Event.Horizon the edge of the black hole and.in fact they will see you ultimately.come to a standstill right at the.Horizon itself but the amazing thing is.from your perspective you will fall.right through that event horizon you.will go right to the center and it will.happen in finite time it will not happen.in some long cosmological time it'll.happen in finite time and so it's not as.though the center of the black hole is.the Big Crunch if there is such a thing.for the universe but it is the case that.we believe that if we could answer the.question of what happens at the center.of a black hole we would then be able to.answer the question of what happens at.the Big Crunch or what happens at the.Big Bang because we Face exactly the.same issue if you weren't so interested.in black holes but you're interested in.How the Universe got started again ask.any physicist what really happened at.the moment of the Big Bang Time Zero.itself if the physicist is.straightforward Hest they say we don't.know for exactly the same reason that's.a realm where the density is so high.that you need general relativity where.quantum physics is vital because it's so.small and the equations break down and.the equ equations are the only tool that.we have to gain insight into Realms that.we can't literally visit and that's the.issue that we're trying to fix okay so.why does it matter that with from your.perspective you would continue falling.at a finite time with regard to the.question of whether what's at the bottom.of the black hole is the eventual.aggregation of all matter I I I.because looking at it from the outside.as that falling entity grinds to a halt.there's an infinite duration of time.that's now involved in the process and.in that infinite duration of time if the.Big Crunch models are correct that big.crunch is eventually going to occur so I.don't understand why they don't yeah why.why they don't necessarily dovetail.let's say or converge so our our yeah so.our goal is to be able to explain the.happenings in the universe from any and.all.perspectives the one thing that Einstein.taught us is that different perspectives.can tell very different stories about.the universe but our goal is to be able.to understand all those stories we want.to chronolog we want to Chronicle all.the narratives if you will that could be.told about the universe and so you're.right from the standpoint of the outside.Observer the chronicle you're telling is.correct infinite time yeah but we also.want to know the chronicle from the.person that could fall in as well yeah.right right right fair enough fair.enough U Okay so so let's go back to.string theory so you made the case that.the um.the equations that govern general.relativity and quantum mechanics don't.dovetail well and that poses certain.interpretive problems and you outlined.what they might be and uh I don't.remember if we did try to nail that down.so that it was more comprehensible if we.got out of the realm of mathematical.Infinity to point out some of the I.maybe that's where we went into the.discussion of the black hole but but.okay so okay fine so let's let's talk.about you know how string theory in.principle reconciles that I'm also.curious you know there's a lot of.physicists who are very skeptical about.spring String Theory as an Enterprise.and so I guess I'm also wondering has.the have the proponents of this Theory.come up with a explanation that adds.additional predictive validity to the.combined use of the theories of general.relativity and of quantum mechanics so.what is string theory and then why.should we believe that the suppositions.of the string theorists have any.validity yeah so they're both good.questions start with the first one so.the basic conventional way of talking.about String Theory the way I spoke.about it even in the elegant Universe.back in.1999 is a slight shift in how we.envision the fundamental ingredients.of matter the old view that we've been.talking about in quantum mechanics are.these little particles they are.described by probability waves but the.particle itself is a little.infinitesimal dot the electron or the.photon String Theory says that you need.to update that picture think now of the.electron as a little tiny vibrating.filament a little tiny vibrating string.like filament think of the photon as a.little tiny vibrating string like.filament and the difference vibrations.of the string just like the string and a.violin produces different musical tones.the different vibrational patterns of.these little strings don't produce.different music they produce the.different particles so a photon is a.string vibrating in one pattern electron.is string vibrating in a different.pattern and so forth that's the basic.idea now why do we invoke that idea and.what does vibration mean is you know I.mean in that situation what does.vibration mean and what's vibrating and.maybe those are nonsensical questions.like the color they're not they're not.nonsensical they're tough questions so.so what is the string made of the best.answer I can give it's made of string.stuff it's made of energy if I could.delineate something yet more fine from.which the string was built our Focus.would be on that finer constituent it.may be if these ideas are correct that.this is the finest ingredient period end.of story we don't know that of course.but that is one way of thinking about.the theory and so the remarkable thing.and this is not obvious and a little.difficult to explain in words but I will.say that mathematically when you make.the move from a point particle to a.filament the problems between general.relativity and quantum mechanics they go.away all of a sudden these two theories.can play well together the Infinities.that we were talking about from the.conventional formulation are quelled.they're tamped down you can make.sensible calculations at least in.principle and that's why this idea took.off in the 1980s I see so now is that.okay so one of the problems that.non-physicists have and I presume.physicists as well is that as WE peer.more and more deeply into the micro.realm we get farther and farther away.from our embodied axiomatic.presuppositions right I mean we're we're.accustomed to dealing with objects in.the macro world that operate like macro.World objects and then as we increase.our resolution the things we're looking.at increasingly don't act like that and.so they escape from our really our.axiomatic or a prior understanding which.is very deeply embodied and so you.already have that problem at the level.of the electron and the photon and it.seems to me not improbable that that.problem would be multiplied if you.increase the level of resolution past.that so is there any possibility.whatsoever of the non mathematically.inclined Observer of even understanding.what it means forther to be filaments or.forther to be vibrations or are those.like second order castings of things.that have to essentially be.mathematical well they are ultimately.mathematical the imagery that we paint.in words is a reasonable approximation.to what we believe the mathematics is.telling us so it's not far from a.reasonable poetic description of what's.Happening down there but you're.absolutely right it's so far from common.experience we're talking about distance.scales that make the atomic seem large.by comparison so we're way way down at a.distance scale of like 10 the minus 33.cm you know an atom is like you know 10.to the minus 10 centimeters or something.so we're talking 20 orders of magnitude.smaller than an atomic ingredients so.we're far far from The Familiar things.that we use to base our understanding of.the world upon right but the question.then you ask is how do you test this and.what practical use is it yeah well.quantum mechanics is obviously insanely.practically useful I mean it's produced.technologies that are World transforming.so but let me just point out on that.because that's a very vital realization.if you would have asked the people who.develop quantum mechanics like Neil's.bore and and Schrodinger if you ask them.way back in the.1920s what's the Practical utility of.what you're working on I'm pretty sure.they would have said not much we're just.trying to understand and so then it's 80.years later we go from understanding to.harnessing so I always find it dangerous.to talk about practical utility of ideas.when they're being formulated because it.may be a century more before they're.actually put in practice but but you.still need to ask the question why.should you believe any of this stuff are.there any experimental tests yes yes.well the same was true of Maxwell when.he discovered Electric right.electromagnet magnetism yeah so and I'm.always and in the elegant Universe back.in 1999 and today I am forthright in.saying there are no experimental.observations there are no definitive.predictions that we can test with.today's technology so we have not been.able to bridge the gap between the.theory and the observation they say what.the heck are you guys doing why are you.still thinking about something and the.answer is we have made such stunning and.I am saying this from the perspective of.someone who's lived a life of.mathematics you know we've made stunning.mathematical advances in this field that.are beyond anything that most of us.would have thought remotely possible to.have occurred by today we've understood.the equations we've been able to gain.insight into the nature of black holes.not answering that fundamental.Singularity question but we understand.the Horizon of a black hole the entropy.of a black hole we've made progress in.understanding the way in which this.mathematics paints a vastly new picture.of reality some of the developments just.in the last few years are are absolutely.mind-blowing so if you are like me and.many of my colleagues willing to defer.observation and experiment for now not.forever but defer it now develop the.mathematics in the hope that this risk.that we are taking that this math may.not be relevant to the world but if it.is it will give us the deepest.explanation.of how the world came to be and how it.came into existence and the fundamental.ingredients and how they behave that.makes the risk for some of us worth.taking it's not a risk worth taking for.everybody this is where human nature.comes into science some scientists God.bless them they're vital need to have an.ongoing dialogue with experiment and.observation for them to feel that what.they're doing matters other scientists.are willing to defer that dialogue.develop the mathematics for however long.it will take if you feel that the math.is progressing at a rate that's.sufficiently gratifying and satisfying.to make you feel that you're en root.toward truth and that's the kind of.person that works on string theory.there's no right or wrong here it's a.matter of scientific taste so science.you could imagine has two polls and one.would be hypothesis generation which is.a relatively mysterious poll and the.other would be verification and testing.and it it's always the case that the.hypothesis generation Horizon exceeds.the testing Horizon because otherwise.the hypothesis would be trivial now and.then the question would be well to what.degree are you temperamentally capable.of what would you say appreciating that.Gap and there's going to be wide.individual differences in that they're.probably related to something like trait.openness but the notion that the.hypothesis should exceed the data is.that's a trism in in in in some regard.now that does open up a very complex.question which is how do you in the.absence of experimental verification how.do you determine which hypotheses Aren't.Dead ends and that seems to have.something to do with it's something like.pattern recognition you know I mean one.of the ways that we determine that.something is real is by Quint angulating.I suppose with our senses and if we can.detect something in five dimensions in.the five sensory dimensions then we.assume that it's real sometimes after.talking to other people who are doing.the same thing but the great pattern.recognizers who are the hypothesis.generators in science seem to do.something approximately the same in the.absence of experimental proof right.they're they're using a vast variety of.information sources to determine whether.their hypothesis are valid as opposed to.say you know delusional conspiracy.theories or their approximation so and.you think the string theorists are okay.so what is it and I think we'll delve.into this more particularly on The Daily.wire side I think maybe actually we'll.turn to that because we are coming to.the to the end of our discussion so I.think what I'm going to do on the daily.wire side for everybody who's watching.and listening is to continue talking to.Brian about the development of his.interest in in the microcosmic realm and.why in particular he was attracted to uh.investigation of string theory per se.there's lots of potential places that.someone with interest in physics might.go and so I'm I'm always interested in.the biographical element so I think.we'll pursue that on the daily wire side.and so um is there anything else that.you can tell people that would flesh out.their understanding of string theory in.in relatively short order I mean I know.that's a tall order but um I'm still the.we we talked about these filaments and.their.vibrations I mean it what's the nature.of that vibration I mean we know that.light waves vary in their quality and.they're be because of of different.frequency of vibration let's say and so.that plays a fundamental role in the.phenomenology of everyday being and so.it's obviously the case that difference.in vibrations can be of crucial.importance like is there an analogy.between electromagnetic.frequency in the case of photons and the.vibrations of the filaments and then how.do you understand the the nature of the.filament because filament sounds.material like it sounds like it's.something that should be made of other.things you know like a like an ordinary.object well our everyday experience.certainly teaches us that any extended.object which is all objects we encounter.in the real world can be cut up into.smaller things and experien has taught.us that if you cut fine enough you may.find new ingredients that were not.visible or available or something that.you would have recognized on the.macroscopic scale if you take that idea.and you bring it into the micro world.you would think that a string itself.could be cut up into Finer Things and.maybe you'll find Ultimate constituents.but again we don't know if that.macroscopic notion applies in the.microscopic realm so you have to be very.careful taking things that you're.familiar with in the macro world and.just porting them into the micro world.so again it might be that we and there.have been some studies that have.suggested the possibility that strings.May themselves be made up of smaller.ingredients but there's also a whole.literature that suggests that they may.be the fundamental entity in a certain.domain of the theory and there isn't.something finer within them but let me.give one if you if you don't mind.because you were saying we're going to.slightly wrapping up this part I want to.leave one idea which is one of the more.spectacular ones it will just take me a.moment to describe of of recent in sight.in string theory many of your your.viewers and listeners may be familiar.with the idea of quantum entanglement.which is the idea that two distant.particles can have kind of a invisible.Quantum link between them where what you.do in one particle instantaneously.affects the other particle the particles.are said to be Quantum entangled a.mind-blowing idea that comes from the.work of Albert Einstein in.1935 your viewers listeners may also be.familiar with the notion of a wormhole a.completely different idea that in.general relativity you can have a tunnel.through the fabric of space linking one.location and the other Einstein.developed that idea too in 1935 just two.months apart from quantum entanglement.for 90 years nobody thought there was.any connection between these two ideas.string theory has recently revealed that.it's very likely that these two ideas.are the same idea described in different.languages that when you have two.particles that are quantum entangled in.some sense there is a tunnel through the.fabric of space a wormhole that is.connecting them together and if this.idea holds up it shows that a general.relativistic idea a tunnel through the.fabric of space and a Quantum idea.quantum entanglement across space are.the same idea which would suggest that.general relativity and quantum mechanics.are deeply connected from the Geto it's.not so much that we need to find a way.of bringing them into Union they may.already already be in Union and what we.need to do with string theory or.whatever approach is understand that.intrinsic relationship more fully this.is the New Perspective that has emerged.in the last decade and it's a thrilling.one all right sir well I think that's a.that's a good place to end that's a nice.ending and so I think we will in fact do.that and so for everybody who is.watching and listening well thank you.for your time and attention thank you to.the Daily wire people for making the.public distribution of this podcast.possible thank you very much sir for.spending the time today delineating out.your ideas that's much appreciated and.uh my pleasure thank you yeah yeah my.pleasure and uh and good luck on the.second edition of your book uh when did.it come.out uh I think last week oh yeah and.how's it do came out I have no idea I've.not been tracking it okay okay well.that's an exciting thing to to that'll.be an exciting thing to encounter with.any luck and so um yeah well thank again.for for talking to us today and then.reme reminder for everybody who's.watching and listening we're going to.delve into um the origin of of Dr.Green's interests and how they developed.across time it's very useful to talk to.people who've been successful in their.field of endeavor to find how that.pathway made itself manifest to them.across the uh ups and downs of their.life and why they stuck with it and what.made them and what made them successful.um everybody has to find out what.compels them and interests them in their.life if they're going to adjust to the.difficulties of their existed.successfully and gaining some insight.into that process is always useful so.that's what we'll delve into on The.Daily wire side so everybody can join us.for that if they're so inclined all.right sir thank you very much much.appreciate the discussion today thank.you.[Music].n.
