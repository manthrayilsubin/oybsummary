well thank you very much ladies and.gentlemen i hope you're sitting.comfortably.because i am.and it is a pleasure to be with you.i told my wife during the week.that there was a shortage of water here.and as we had a surface of water.recently i asked her to send some to you.so it would appear that that has.happened today.and i am simply delighted for you.and thanks for the invitation.to talk.about a book of scripture that has.influenced me for many years.the book of daniel that may seem very.remote.i believe it refers to a time 25.centuries ago or so.but nevertheless it resonates.with so many of the issues that.constantly face us.today.so let me briefly introduce a few basic.ideas of the first one.is a question of culture.that we're dealing with a very high.culture indeed.at the time when.daniel.was written.the city of babylon.was one of the wonders.of the ancient world.the babylonians had developed.methods in very many different fields.that we would recognize today.they had the beginnings of an idea of.how to build skyscrapers.they were brilliant at hydraulics and.drainage.they built.vast platforms for observing the stars.and trying to make some sense out of.their movements they did get astronomy.mixed with astrology but.their mathematics was nothing less than.spectacular when you think of the script.they were using.and their influence is so.all permeating that most of us tonight.have evidence of babylon attached to our.person.because we've got instruments for.measuring time.and there are 60 seconds in a minute and.60 minutes in an hour and that goes.right back to babylon.because they discovered that the number.60.being.divisible by.quite a large number of whole number.factors was a very useful base.to which to work.so it was a very high culture indeed.and.daniel and his friends were captured.by a raid.by nebuchadnezzar the emperor of babylon.and being a sophisticated monarch.he chose the brightest people in the.nations he captured.took them to king's college babylon.and put them through an education for.three years i think that's where.cambridge and oxford.got the idea.from.their transition from.judah.to babylonia was.a matter of a few days.but they moved from one culture to a.totally different culture.in judah.it was a narrowly monotheistic culture.and outside the theology of it.it had nothing of the advances the.scientific advances the artistic.literary music advances of babylonia.and suddenly they find themselves having.to learn a new language subject to new.laws.and finding everything completely.different.in the country i come from.i've stayed there all my life.but the culture has totally changed.around me.and that happens in many countries in.the world.we don't move.but the culture changes and we begin to.sense.things are not like what they wear.and the transition of babylon of daniel.and his friends to babylon.is very like.what has happened in the uk and in.europe.we've moved from.a moderately monotheistic culture with a.strong influence over over a thousand.years of christianity.to an increasingly secular culture.now babylon was a polytheistic culture.and we'll talk about that in a moment.but the main point i want to make.tonight is this.that here were teenagers normally people.were enrolled so far as we know in the.university of babylon at about 15..they lose their family they lose most of.their friends they're just four lads.together.and the amazing thing about them is that.daniel rose.to occupy a position in world history.that is unique.that is he rose.to rule essentially under the emperor.over two.consecutive empires that has never.happened before the nearest thing i can.think of it.is the position of hong kong.where hong kong was ruled by the british.for quite a while and then it was.transitioned.to the chinese.and the story of that transition i.cannot tell it here but it is utterly.fascinating because.it might surprise you there were.christians involved at a very high level.indeed.managing that transition.but here were daniel and his friends.in a completely new culture.now i'm as you can see i'm pretty old.and i've lived to see many people who.still go to church.and they still read their bibles but.something happened to them along the way.and they have lost the cutting edge of.their witness.their faith in god in christ has become.privatized.under the pressure.of the kind of attitude that.characterizes my society you don't do.god in public.well ladies and gentlemen i do do god in.public.and i think it's enormously important.that we fight against that currency of.thought.that suggests that god is a purely.private matter the creator of the.universe cannot be.a purely private matter.but that raises.a very important question that we can.use to analyze this book.because daniel.he didn't lose his piety he didn't lose.his devotion.that's often the case but he didn't lose.his cutting-edge public witness.and when i approach this book one of the.big questions i ask is.can we learn anything.from his experience that would put steel.into our hearts.and give us the guts to go out and face.the public.with what we believe to be true what was.the secret of his stability.and his courage in the public space and.we're going to analyze just a little bit.of that and chat about it tonight the.british museum and the pergamon museum.in berlin are places where you can see.spectacular remnants.of the kind of artistry.in babylon.and i have often gone to the babylonian.section the british museum simply to.admire.the level of that culture and that of.course must have raised a question for.daniel and his friends that nothing like.it in judah it was a tiny little state.hardly maintaining its existence and.rapidly to lose its existence they had.nothing like this culture and yet the.culture was the most adult idolatrous in.the ancient world at that time what.could be wrong with it.that was a big question because daniel.and his friends quite obviously once.they got over the trauma.which must have been very real of losing.their parents and so on.in the end they entered into the study.in babylon with great vigor.they didn't run away and form an.exclusive ghetto in the desert no they.took advantage of the study in that.university of babylon.just as i have taken advantage of study.in universities in the united kingdom.but we'll have a look at that a bit.later coming to the book itself it's a.very odd book because.it is.written in two languages i'm not saying.it's bilingual.but.the language changes there's hebrew and.aramaic and then hebrew.and that's very odd and the scholars.argue about what that.could possibly mean.but not being a scholar i rush in where.angels fear to tread.and i simply observe.that the book of daniel was not in its.entirety written by daniel.chapter 4 is written by nebuchadnezzar.it's in the first person i.nebuchadnezzar.and therefore it's a testimony.of how.the most powerful man at the time in the.ancient world.came to believe in daniel's god.and that bit.is embedded in the aramaic part.aramaic was a lingua franca hebrew was.not.so here we have from the ancient world.at least.a kind of tract which announced to the.world.that the emperor had become a believer.in god and why.and that's a very remarkable thing.think today if we had writings of.leading politicians in the world.describing how they'd found god we'd use.them.and so.we look at it as a book by daniel and.yes it is.but.there's a great deal about it in the in.its first half at least.about.nebuchadnezzar the emperor and we need.to look at it through his eyes.how it was that daniel and his friends.communicated god.to this man whose concept of god was.simply a polytheistic one.and then we come to a question of.authenticity.the book of daniel has provoked a lot of.confer controversy over the years.because it is at least in part a.predictive prophecy it claims to be.talking about the future beyond the time.of.daniel.now if daniel lived in the 6th century.bc.towards the end of the book.he appears to be writing.about the time from alexander the great.down to antiochus epiphanes ii.and the accuracy.of the.complex interchanges.the ebb and flow of war.particularly between the north and the.south.and constantly battling in the land of.palestine.has led many people to think.that he must have lived in the second.century bc why because he got it right.and that raises a very interesting.question.is it predictive prophecy.that was revealed to daniel before it.happened or is it retrospective.writing that's put into the mouth of.somebody called daniel and it pretends.to be from the 6th century.now that raises a huge question.of the supernatural.dimension to the spoken elsewhere.and the interesting thing is that daniel.himself deals with this question within.the book.whether we get to that tonight or not i.just don't know.but we shall see.extra biblical evidence is there there.are all kinds of.beautiful.cuneiform cylinders in the british.museum written.in this cuneios in latin as a wedge this.web shape writing and if you saw their.mathematics done in this stuff you would.be amazed how they can calculate.anything now this was found at the.ziggurat or the skyscraper or south of.babylon.one at each corner and it celebrates.nobody's.one of the emperors commencing his.rebuilding.and very interestingly there is this.babylonian chronicle.which explicitly mentions the capture of.jerusalem in 597b.c.so we've got.external evidence.supporting what we read inside the book.of daniel.the next question is the world view of.the babylonians.and it was quite complex it's a fairly.typical world view of the ancient near.east they believed in many gods.creation proceeded through sexual unit.um union of the gods but the most.important thing.is that they had a theogony and not.simply a cosmogeny.cosmogeny is the idea that the universe.had a genesis.and we're very familiar with that in.terms of the big bang and all the rest.of what astrophysics has to tell us.but in addition the ancient near eastern.world view.had a theogony.that is the gods were not eternal they.were generated.and they were generated from the.primeval stuff of the universe.they had long before.moderns thought of it the idea of a.primeval soup.they had a primeval sea and the gods.were generated from this primeval soup.and their gods were of course.essentially.deifications of the forces of nature now.what is extremely interesting to me.and begins to show us the relevance of.this book to the contemporary world.is that.they deified those forces of nature.and if you take a physicist like paul.davis whose books i like to read.he will.accept to a certain extent the kind of.design argument that says look the laws.of nature the motions of the planets.seem to indicate to us that there's vast.intelligence out there.but he says of course it isn't.supernatural intelligence it's.superhuman but not supernatural it must.have evolved from the primeval stuff of.the universe just as we have done that.is exactly what the babylonians believed.the only difference is they called them.gods.and.we might as well today because for many.of my atheist colleagues the forces of.nature are the ultimate controllers.and denying god they cannot get away.from the idea of creation so instead of.a transcendent god who causes the.universe to exist and sustains it.they invest matter and energy.with creative powers well they used to.nowadays they've got down to investing.nothing with creative powers.so that for the first time in my life i.never thought we'd get there.the choice for us is between god and.nothing.as the originator of the universe and i.would just point out.that the universe comes from nothing.physical it does not come from nothing.it comes from god who is spirit and not.physical but that's a story for.investigation another time the point is.that when you just get rid of the.extraneous.theistic god's language from babylon.they are like contemporary naturalists.or more accurately.materialists.and therefore daniel is facing a culture.in the university of babylon later.that's.very similar to our culture particularly.in europe and that makes this book.enormously relevant how do you deal with.that kind of pressure.now the book itself has got a.fascinating literary structure.it's obviously not chronological because.the revelations of seven and eight occur.before chapter six.neither is it neatly divided into.prophecy and narrative.but.as professor david gooding showed many.years ago.it has a very distinctive and clear.literary structure and thought flow.treating scriptures literature is very.important.because i discovered in my young days.that my problem with the bible was i.treated it as less than a book.i wasn't even applying the ordinary.canons of thought that i'd apply to any.book and therefore i got very little out.of it so i was very glad to have.a mentor who helped me to see and daniel.is one of the clearest now this is going.to be the most rapid introduction to a.book of the bible that you've ever heard.daniel has 10.major sections and they follow the.chapters.up until the last one.the story in the university where daniel.refuses the king's food.then nebuchadnezzar has a dream and he.sees a colossal image that gets toppled.then he builds a colossal real image of.gold and asks everybody to bow down and.worship it.then nebuchadnezzar gets proud.about babylon and he is cut down and he.behaves like an animal for seven years.and then.belshazzar who takes the golden vessels.from the temple the vessels from.jerusalem.and uses them to worship his gods in the.writing comes on the wall and it.condemns him.and that's the climax the death of.belshazzar is the end of the babylonian.dynasty it's not the end of babylon city.that confuses some people we're talking.about babylon all the way through.but there's a regime change.and the babylonian dynasty gives.way to the mado persian dynasty.and that.joint so to speak occurs in the book of.daniel and it is a very important and.interesting joint indeed.then.in the middle persian dynasty.darius.wants to promote daniel.and the civil servants don't like daniel.and they concoct a very clever scheme.to.pitch him.the law of his god against the law of.the median persians and he gets thrown.in the lion's den and god rescues him.you then have a vision that daniel had.of four beasts or animals that's.followed by a vision of two animals.and then chapter nine.daniel is studying scripture and he.takes it very seriously and he realizes.that the time of the exile is about to.end and he wonders what's going to.happen and he prays about the city of.jerusalem and he discovers.to his horror really.that a lot more things have to happen.before jerusalem can look to any.restoration.and then chapters 10 11 and 12 obviously.form a connected argument.and they are a revelation not like.chapter nine which is scripture jeremiah.they are a revelation of something.called the writing of truth that.discusses the time of the end now if you.look at that for a long time.you will see.that it has a shape.that helps carry the message you start.off with one chapter.administration in babylon then there are.two images a dream image and a real.image.and then you get the discipline of two.kings nebuchadnezzar's madness and.belshazzar being executed.and then you have.another single chapter administration in.medo-persia the civil servants against.daniel then you have a pair.of visions of animals and then you have.a pair of explanations of two different.kinds of writings and so if you set them.side by side.you see that the book splits.into two halves.and the end of the first half coincides.with the end of babylonian supremacy.the end of the second half.is the time of the end looking way off.into the future because daniel is one of.the only books in the old testament that.mentions the resurrection of the dead.so the s.the.scope of the entire book is very.considerable indeed.so with that.very rapid background.let's look.at one or two of the principles.that.help daniel maintain his stability just.to give you a flavor of the idea now.here's the very start of the book in the.third year of the reign of yahaya kim.king of judah.nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came to.jerusalem and besieged it.and the lord gave yahya kim king of.judah into his hand.so that the book begins.with a historical.annotation.but it's not merely a historical.annotation.it's a very unusual and we might say a.very daring interpretation of history.the lord gave jehoiakim who was a very.weak king of a tiny state.into the hand of the great emperor with.all the vast armies at his disposal.and any contemporary historian would say.this is absurd.you see if it had said and the lord gave.nebuchadnezzar.into the hand of jehoiakim that would.have been pretty impressive.but it doesn't it says the lord gave.yahoya came into nebuchadnezzar's hand.and.any secular historian would say don't be.ridiculous.this is simply a matter of the survival.of the fittest this is the big state the.big empire with all the weapons.trampling on very easily.a very weak state.and yet daniel risks the criticism.he says god was behind it.now think about it.this is a global seismic shift in.history.it was traumatic for daniel and his.friends.and yet he believed that god was behind.it.and this raises something very important.and one of the secrets i believe.open secrets of what helped him he had a.sense.of the god of global history.and he had a sense of the god of his own.personal history.and you know it's very easy to believe.in a god of both histories if.everything's going well.but of global history.interferes with your personal history.and leads to pain and suffering and.uncertainty and doubt and despair and.horror.that's a different matter altogether.and perhaps some of you are sitting.there in an audience this size they're.about to be people here.bit of a big question mark over their.personal history.has god forgotten me.can i really trust him because something.has happened.perhaps you're not.responsible for it it's happened in that.sense globally at some level.and you're an unwilling victim of it.and it gives you the impression that god.has lost control.that's a huge question ladies and.gentlemen and that's the question with.which this book begins it invites us to.ask the question because.from a secular point of view it's such.an absurd statement.but then you see.that sense.of the hand of god behind history.both global and personal.is one of the most stabilizing things in.life.it is a magnificent thing to know.that god is in that ultimate sense and.it's very complex god's control is.unfathomable in my view and you see.examples of it in scripture but i think.that what daniel's doing he's writing as.an old man.and he's writing about the big things.in his.history so that's number one.but then that sentence didn't end there.you see i deliberately didn't rig you.the whole sentence.and the lord gave jehoiakim king of.judah into his hand with some of the.vessels of the house of god.and he brought them to the land of.shenar to the house of his god and.placed the vessels in the treasury of.his god.well what's that got to do with.everything.of all the things you might write to.this highly compressed document.what on earth are you doing writing.about nebuchadnezzar pinching some of.the vessels from the temple in jerusalem.now as a mathematician.a kind of scientist i suppose if you're.generous um i'm interested in anomalies.in science they're the interesting.things.why is that anomalous it's exactly the.same in scripture this just shouts at.you.what is this doing here you haven't yet.been introduced to daniel.but you're told about this incident.of taking the vessels.taking them to.babylon and then a double statement.the temple of his god and he put them in.the treasure house of his god.now the idea of a museum is very ancient.and babylon had many often attached to.temples where.nebuchadnezzar.displayed the artifacts.that he had.obtained in his various raids about the.place museums are like that aren't they.they're full of stolen i mean they're.full of all kinds of.they're full of all kinds of artifacts.that are sometimes obtained by slightly.underhand names that we needn't go into.and.these emperors were quite naive and you.can just imagine this little section.marked judah on the such and such i.nebuchadnezzar i conquered this nation.here's some of their artifacts are.rather beautiful aren't they what a.clever boy i am to have conquered this.nation it was that kind of naive.childish pride that drove these people.but there's more to it than that.why mention it.well.these were golden and silver vessels.in the temple at jerusalem.they stood for something.they stood for.the.biblical.scheme of values gold was their most.precious metal.and there was a lot of it in the temple.actually in solomon's temple and the.psalmist as he sat there contemplating.it says every bit of it shouts glory.it was a simple obvious symbol.of the glory of god as their supreme.value.let's just think about that for a moment.because our first issue was history now.we're moving to something utterly.crucial then and now.and that is the question of values.now.to daniel and his friends.those vessels symbolized absolute value.now there's a question for the 21st.century.is there such a thing as absolute.value is there such a thing as absolute.truth.or is everything relative.it always amuses me.the people that insist on telling me.that.everything is relative and they expect.me to take that statement as an absolute.it's hard isn't it but that's curious.inverted.incoherent thinking.but let's think of what he did.to daniel this was absolute value he put.it in.a museum display of one little country.in other words.for him it was of relative value.and that is to say he did what many.people do.he relativized the absolute.that is a trend he observed have you.observed it.now we're going to learn later on.that he couldn't rest content.with relativizing the absolute because.you can't live.without absolute so he absolutized the.relative.and that happens.in chapter 3.where he makes a statue of gold.and commands everybody.at least his nobility and elite to bow.down and worship it he's absolutizing.the relative in this case the state.but these days it can be one of a fairly.small number of things.power.sex money.and there's a risk in our hearts that we.do that.and the only thing that's protecting us.from absolutizing the relative.is that we regard.god as absolute now there's a christian.version of this.and you've probably prayed it.our father hallowed be your name.hallowed means set apart as absolute.value.and it's one of the secrets of our.witness to the world the apostle peter.says that if we're going to be able as.he commands us all to do.to be ready to give a defense to anybody.who asks us a reason for the hope that.is within us.please notice ladies and gentlemen that.that is not preaching.give an answer to people who ask you.that isn't preaching that's dialogue.it's conversation between two people or.three.you've got to be ready to do that.how are you going to be ready to do that.and he prefaces it by talking about fear.which is very natural.and then he says set apart.jesus in your hearts as lord.that is.we got to be clear as to who.our absolute value is if we're going to.have the courage to witness into our.society.now you might want to question me about.this because.i find that people today there's a lot.of fear around the place and i.understand it i don't care who you are.we've all got a level of fear.where we're forced by peer pressure to.duck it and how you can overcome it in a.society that's ever increasingly complex.and the first argument is look if people.ask me questions what do i do.if i can't answer them.well if that's of interest to you ask me.in the question time.because now we're going to move on a.little bit you see.we're going to move on to the next.question which is a question of.education.and nebuchadnezzar.chose the top people in the countries he.contacted.he overcame and he had them educated.at the top university in babylon and his.method so far as we understand was to.keep the brightest in babylon.and the next brightest he would send.back to the countries from which they.came to rule for him.and there is an interesting description.of what he does.they were to choose.use without blemish of good.um.appearance skillful and all wisdom and.doubted knowledge understanding learning.and competence to stand in the king's.palace and to teach them the literature.and language of the coldest now this is.a very enlightened civil service.because it taught them literature.i wonder how many civil services in the.world teach literature.why would you teach literature.because of course literature.gets you in contact with the soul of a.nation.and nebuchadnezzar was bright enough.to understand that if people were going.to rule efficiently they needed to know.not merely the language but the.literature.and you know that is application.paul the apostle loved the greeks enough.to have read their stuff.do you read their stuff.i mean the stuff of the people out there.what they believe so that when paul was.put on the spot he was able to quote.true insights of pagan greek poets to.build bridges between himself and his.audience.if you start reading the newspaper.you can begin to do that.and to find out what makes people tick.and what's concerned them and so on.so nebuchadnezzar's educational policy.at king's.sorry at king's college babylon.was a very interesting thing.and the food was terrific because they.were fed for the from the king's table.and they were to be examined in the end.very unusually by the emperor he was a.bright boy.he did the final exams himself of the.top people.and they were to stand before the king.and then daniel and his friends are.introduced.and it says that the chief of the.eunuchs gave them names.daniel he called belte.this is fascinating to me.this is a very early.example.of.social engineering.you see their names had meaning.and i.imagine.a conversation that happened in the.student dining hall.on the first evening when these four.chaps were sitting in a corner feeling.pretty grim i imagine and some.thoughtful babylonian student comes up.and says guys who are you i haven't seen.you around here before my name's naboo.i'm actually named after the moon god.who are you well i'm daniel you're what.danielle never heard the name before.what sort of a name is that i mean my.name is a meaning.it's.the name of the moon god.what does your name mean.well it means god is my judge.it means what.god is my judge.what.ethnic group are you from.i'm a hebrew oh dear i'm really sorry i.did hear that nebuchadnezzar beat you.people up.a while back but don't worry you'll get.used to university and this is a.wonderful city to study but.your name god is my judge i mean does it.surprise you that he overcame your view.you have a name like that.what a grim idea.having a god that's always watching you.and now i hear the voice of christopher.hitchens.in one of our debates saying your god is.like a north korean dictator in the sky.always watching you.and i said christopher you make me.really sad.do you know i have somebody watching me.all the time.and i don't mind it a bit she's called.my wife.and the reason i don't mind it a bit is.because she loves me.and your caricature of god.is a tragedy.because if you once begin to understand.that god loves you you will be very.grateful that he watches you all the.time.god is my judge well that's absurd says.naboo you poor chap.and you can just see daniel's wheels of.his mind working.we're all in a course doing law that's.right we've got the code of hammurabi.tomorrow i believe introductory.lectures and the code of hammurabi.are you interested no he said of course.we're all interested in law i'm hoping.myself to be a lawyer oh really and.possibly even a judge oh so you do.believe in judgment.tell me naboo.what is the basis of judgment.is it relative or is it transcendent.you can just see the argument star can't.you.marvelous possibility to use his name to.witness to one of the big questions of.our contemporary world.when i studied medical ethics one of the.most interesting courses was in law they.tried to persuade me to stay another.year to get a degree in law but my.brother keeps pointing out i'm perishing.by degrees so it was better to stop that.but anyway.um.law.you're studying law and what i.found out in studying bioethics is.there's one question that people avoid.they avoid it in medical ethics they.avoid it in business ethics they avoided.in ordinary legal procedure and.everywhere else and it's the question.who said so.what is the authority of your ethics.nobody wants to answer that and it's.most interesting studying cases complex.ethical cases in the high court where.you see them floundering they don't want.to.pin down the source of their ethics.that's why we're in such confusion in.europe by the way.we've denied the transcendent source of.law that's been there for centuries.and now it's all relative and nobody.knows on what to base law.they if you disbelieve in god you're.going to base it on nature either raw.nature or sophisticated evolved nature.so to speak but then you've got a huge.choice within biology.if you follow.one line.you will.um.follow somebody like spencer the the the.survival of the fittest and we all know.what that's led to in law or you follow.somebody like darwin who studied ants.and saw that they cooperated and he.thought that could be a basis of.altruism the trouble with.getting law from beneath humanity.from the animal kingdom as you can set.up any system you'll find every single.system of ethics.imagined.that you could ever think of.that raises huge questions.but of course there were other lads.there and i can imagine hananiah coming.in and saying.look daniel just shut up a minute.because he needs to hear what my name.means.the lord shows grace.oh so you believe in the grace god and.daniel believes in the judge god no no.no we don't believe in multiple gods.says misha l who is what god is misha el.there is only one god.and then azariah gently in the end.coming in and said guys.my name means the lord helps this is.real to us.now why don't you watch us for a few.weeks.and say if there's any reality in our.behavior.they could use their names to witness.couldn't they.but they weren't allowed to.their names were changed.because that's what babylon does it.changes names.and in some cases their new babylonian.names were a.parody.of their hebrew names look at meshach.michel meshach.aku is the moon god.misha el who is what god is the true god.who is what the moon god is they.couldn't help it.this is social engineering of the kind.that puts everybody in blue jeans that.makes everybody look exactly the same.the tall puppy as the australians say.must be cut down.and there is enormous pressure in our.society to do that.they mustn't carry an identifier.not even a cross.that might identify them as something.different from the norm.it is a brilliant way of producing.conformity.and it happens subtly out in our society.won't talk start to talk to you about.that.but it is a very subtle thing.it has a history and this is a very.important history.because.babylon in the ancient world was not.beijing or new york or london it was.babylon and it stood for something.what did it stand for will you remember.the story.let's make a city in a tower that it.might reach to heaven.and let us make a name for ourselves.that we won't be scattered in all the.earth.and so they built a skyscraper.and if you've ever studied the.philosophy of skyscrapers it's very.interesting.and the bottom line is that behind every.skyscraper there's an even bigger ego.have you noticed that every country.practically in the world wants to build.the tallest building have you ever asked.why that is well you should.let us make a name for ourselves because.you see name is now a question of.identity.who am i.how do i construct meaning in my life.and that's exactly what babel tried to.do.and then we're going to reach to heaven.and it's almost comical i think the.writer of genesis had the sense of humor.he said god came down to see their city.they hadn't quite reached heaven.apparently.he came down to have a look at it.now in the next chapter of genesis.god calls.a man called abram.and he says to him.leave your country.i will make your name great.there are two ways of gaining.significance ladies and gentlemen.one is to restlessly try.to push our way.into making a name for ourselves.and it's a method that is all too common.push the other guy out of the way if you.have to but above all.create an identity for yourself.or.we learn to be content with the identity.that god gives us.and that isn't always easy.for christian people.people have difficulty with their name.who are they.and as they see.other people who are more intelligent.brighter wealthier all this kind of.thing.the doubt creeps in.years ago i was talking about things.like this.and.just as i came to an end.a lovely girl came up and she stood.and she lifted her face to the audience.she was beautiful half of her face was.beautiful.the rest of it.was.blotched by an extremely large and very.ugly birthmark.and i wondered what she was doing there.and she.looked at us with her head up.and she said i've been listening to this.and she said i want to say publicly for.the first time in my life.i want to thank god for who i.am there wasn't a dry eye in the place.she said i'm not a fatalist i'm not a.determinist.but she said i've come to say that i can.accept this.from the hand of a loving god and i.remember sitting there i wasn't very old.and saying have you got that far.have you gone that far.this is big stuff isn't it.it is so deep and important so god is.prepared to give us a name however.little it may appear to other people.or however great if it's significance.coming from god that gives us a true.identity and now to come rapidly to an.end just to encourage you daniel's name.was changed by babylon it was restored.by mido persia.his name is retained to the end of the.book.but now finally the protest against the.food.in the refectory.and students do this all the time and.you probably did it yourself.look back and be honest did you always.enjoy the food that was served up no.although i must say the food in south.africa is something else but i'm not.going to that.and daniel it says resolve not to defile.himself.with the food and the wine that was.served up and they're all kinds of.thinking about this.was it to do with israel's food laws it.could well be.and there are various reasons that i.cannot develop now.but i want to suggest that he was.protesting.against the world view that was behind.the education.now why do i suggest that.well because.he wasn't simply protesting about the.food everybody concentrates on the food.in the scholarly articles i've read most.people forget the wine.daniel was not teetotal.he liked south african wine actually but.anyway you can read.later in the book that he hadn't let.wine pass his lips for a number of weeks.which showed that he normally drank it.so this is not a t-total protest.well what is it then.well think about it.the first half of the first chapter of.the book.talks about the vessels that were taken.to babylon.the second half talks about a protest.against the wine.the final chapter the climax.of the babylonian empire was when those.two concepts come together in chapter.five and belshauser gets the vessels out.and pours wine into them.and invites or forces.his nobility to drink to the gods from.those golden vessels.and the hand comes out.and everybody understood what it wrote.but nobody did.because they were familiar marks that.would be on weights measures values it.was as if.god suddenly wrote here.and on the screen appeared a euro sign a.pound sign a rand sign and a dollar sign.you'd know exactly what it meant but you.wouldn't know what it meant.you are weighed in the balances and.found one thing.belshazzar evaluated god at zero so god.evaluated him at zero and that night the.empire fell.that's why those vessels in chapter one.are important they caused.the collapse of the entire empire.that's pretty serious stuff.i wonder i couldn't prove it to you.but if daniel at the beginning had some.sense.that by taking the wine he might be.involving himself.in a situation which he couldn't easily.get out of now i.am a fellow of an oxford college.and i am.the nearest thing to a chaplain.very odd for a professor of mathematics.to be that but i am that.so from time to time i say a latin grace.and it's very difficult to imagine such.an idolatrous culture as this.without the constant.presentation at the beginning of meals.of libations to the gods that the.students did.i can't prove that to you.but i suspect that daniel was dimly.aware of what would one day happen.and he said no.i'll accept the education but i will not.accept the worldview that's behind it.now that's easy to say that ladies and.gentlemen.it's another matter of practicing it as.i have to.i live in a thoroughly secular.university.its dominant philosophy is naturalism.it's atheism.i accept the.the education.now how do i protest.it's not easy to answer that you will.notice that the book of daniel tells you.what they did in their time it doesn't.tell you what to do in your time.you have to work that out yourself.and so.i believe that daniel was protesting in.a simple and powerful way and the dean.of students.he befriended the dean of students this.pagan man.and daniel said to him look can you.change our food just quietly and the man.said oh.gosh you're going to endanger my head.with the king.why should he see you worse off.you'll endanger my head with the king.and daniel proposed the first.controlled trial in history.and he said look.you.give us these quietly for 10 days and.then judged by what you see.the issue ladies and gentlemen is not.identity.it's image.how big an issue is that.huge.if you know anything about what's.happening to many of our young people.with self-harm.with the horrific cyber bullying that's.going on on the internet.the loss of self-esteem.the collapse of image it's a huge.problem in our society today.people want an image.and the babylonian culture was very much.image good-looking young people do you.remember the beginning.why should he make see you looking.different.you've got to look the same.i close with a little story.when i was 19.i met a nobel prize winner for the first.time.and i talked to him a little bit dinner.just happened to be sitting near me.and.i talked to him a bit about science and.i tried to ask him whether.his science had ever led him to think.that there might be something behind the.universe that's as far as i got because.he was clearly not comfortable with the.question.and i backed off and that was it i.thought.but at the end of the mail.he said lennox i'd like you to come to.my room.and i could tell from his voice that it.didn't bode well and he invited several.other professors no students and they.took me up the room.set me on a chair and they stood around.me.he said no.do you want a career in science.i said yes sir well he said right.tonight in front of witnesses you're.going to give up your naive ideas of god.they will you.you will never look good among your.peers you'll never make it you'll never.do any good so give it up i'd never.known pressure like that in my life i.was only 19..i couldn't help thinking.that if i'd been an atheist and he a.christian doing that he'd have lost his.job the next day.but it was okay to do it.to browbeat me.so in the end i just said well sir what.have you to offer me that's better than.what i've already got.and he came up with the philosophy of.emil.bergson which i knew about because.i'd read c.s lewis and i looked at him.and said if that's all you've got.i'll stick with what i've got and i'll.take the risk.and that's one of the reasons i'm.sitting here it's one of the reasons i.wrote this book on daniel.because in that day still entered my.heart and soul.and i resolved that of ever i had the.chance to be in an academic.position i would.present to the public as fairly as.possible the evidence.in the case of god and science and.everything else and not try to bro beat.people.but allow them the dignity of making up.their own.minds.the book of daniel is a book.about swimming against the flow.and i'm just going to say one more thing.if i may.when you get.to chapter.six.there is another protest.the civil servants want.to get at daniel because darius was.going to make him the head of the.pyramid.system of government.and so they were very clever.they decided to get darius to sign into.being a new law.now the very interesting thing about.this is.that the big difference between babylon.and medo-persia.is that babylon.was an absolute monarchy in the ancient.sense.and middle persia was a constitutional.monarchy which had laws to which the.emperor himself was subject.now that raises a very interesting.question which is better.well anyway these civil servants came to.darius and very cleverly they said your.majesty you know this is a big country.we've taken over and we think it'd be.very good idea just for a month so as we.don't upset people but to give a central.focus to worship so that everybody's.singing from the same hymn sheet and we.thought your majesty it might be good to.have you as the object of worship and of.course he fell for it.and he signed the law and it stated.twice in the chapter according to the.law of the maids and persians that.cannot be altered or changed.and then he found he'd been tricked and.daniel ended up in the lion's den and he.spent 24 hours trying to reverse the law.and he found what many people have found.down through history that the whole.point of statute law is that it is not.easily reversed.he couldn't reverse it.nebuchadnezzar would have just ignored.it.but darius had to be under it.and it's the first evidence in the book.of stopping.believers practicing their own faith.up until this point if you look.carefully you'll find that the pressure.is to get believers involved in pagan.practices.but here is a step.a very serious step.in a negative.direction.you're not allowed to practice your own.faith and ladies and gentlemen.it's happening in all of our countries.today.stealth laws we call them.they're put on the statute book and what.do they do.you see normally for centuries the law.of god and the law of the land have run.in parallel.don't murder don't murder and so on but.now.laws are being deliberately introduced.that force a clash.that if you obey them you cannot obey.scripture.and in our country they are coming like.a flood.and how long it will be before there are.christians.sitting in prison.not because they have done something.wrong but because they have followed.their christian faith.i just don't know.now this is an appeal to lawyers.this is enormously important that the.rest of us who are not trained in law.have people who study these things and.can help advise us.because we are going to need certainly.in england and america all the advice we.can possibly get because it's so.interesting that the first case of anti.if you like discrimination in this book.of daniel is by manipulating the law.and i regard that as enormously.important.and prescient.26 centuries ago the bible's got this.idea.and we are now seeing it almost for the.first time in history well that'll do.thank you very much for listening.[Applause].thanks prof linux i'm sure your mind's.spinning like mine.those question papers we handed out so.you can write down questions if you've.written something down pass them to the.center please if you haven't and you.still want to right now then write them.down and possibly send it we'll collate.them together but we can have a five.minute stretch your legs break while we.do that.i'm going to ask questions out of this.batch of questions trying to.batch them together.and.address as many issues as we can we're.obviously not going to get anywhere near.all of them there's quite a lot of them.and i hope we cover the most important.ones.but i've been given the.the authority to choose them.and we'll see how it goes.first question.can you say more about.identity.as opposed to the image we portray in.our lives day to day and how we can move.beyond the mask.into the true identities given to us by.god.well first let me say thanks for all the.questions.this is a q a and you soon discover it's.a very inadequate process.first of all you will plumb the depths.of my ignorance.and secondly.i can only respond off the top of my.head as to how i would begin to think.about these questions that doesn't.matter actually.because if these are serious questions.you're asking and not just testing what.i know or don't know you'll find that.out anyway.then the work you do afterwards in.getting a satisfactory answer will.last your life.so it's very important not to just leave.it.up this evening.image and identity are hugely complex.things and.for the sake of the exposition and.getting some ideas.across tonight.i separated them to a certain extent.but that is only the beginning i was.emphasizing the importance.and for a christian.the new testament is a great deal to say.about finding our identity in christ.one of the radically new concepts of the.new testament that you don't meet in any.classical religion or philosophy is the.notion of in christ you never get greeks.talking about in zeus or anything like.that.and therefore it's very important.to realize that these old testament.stories they raise questions.but there's much more to be thought.about them.when you come to the new testament.and.in my experience of people.often what's clogging up their lives.one possibility there are many others is.guilt.i find that sometimes christians who.have been christians a long time have.never really understood the gospel in.the sense that they've never really.grasped forgiveness.and they're constantly fighting against.themselves because they can't forgive.themselves.and they don't realize that.one of the most powerful things about.the message of the cross is.christ knew all about this.and he has died for it.but that sounds to them remote and.sometimes just over theological but they.can't grasp the fact and accept they're.forgiven.and that can mess up their sense of.peace and identity and everything else.with it.so the important thing i think is.that we maintain.a living relationship with the lord.now.in a family.that means that husbands need to be.praying with their wives i'm just amazed.at how many people i meet that that.doesn't happen.even young people.and of course we're all failures but my.wife and i have found over the years.that reading some simple set of notes.nothing complex nothing wrong long but.something where we can relate to a piece.of scripture then pray together.it it makes a huge difference to your.sense of value.because if you don't value your spouse.enough to pray with them there's.something badly wrong if you're a.christian forgive me for being so blunt.but i have seen marriages repaired my.wife and i we've seen all kinds of.amazing things happen to people's sense.of peace well-being and identity by.simply getting them into those few.minutes of scripture a day.the enemy will do anything to stop you.doing that.so that's just one suggestion but i'll.try and keep things short so you can.move on.another question came up a lot is one.you suggested.how do you respond when you don't have.an answer to someone by saying i don't.know.you've got to learn that.because here's image losing face nobody.likes losing face.but you'll never lose face.by hearing a question and saying you.don't know how to answer it you'll gain.faith.the thing that will lose your face.is saying i can answer that when it's.obvious you haven't a clue.and this fear barrier can be overcome.you see i often talk to huge audiences.and i take questions.and i don't mind saying i don't know and.you know what happens when you do that.people now realize that a christian can.be human.because some people have been educated.theologically sadly to think that a.christian is a person that knows the.answer to every question we don't.and here's a huge opportunity.to.well let me go back a little bit and.encourage you because.i know that the most difficult thing is.the initial engagement.the world is full of silent christians.who have non-christian friends but they.never talk to them because they don't.know how to begin well when i meet.somebody new.do you know what i try to do i play.socrates.i keep asking questions until they ask.me one.try it.it is fascinating and i don't mean.complex questions i mean about their.families and their interests and so on.and sooner unless they're total bores.they will ask you a question.and you befriend them that way people.love being asked questions because it is.a demonstration of interest and you can.ask them all kinds of simple questions.arising out of the daily news when.there's some catastrophe you can simply.say to a friend you know.do you have resources to cope with this.awful kind of thing.and don't then give them your little.message.we are all desperately inclined to give.them our little message one shot and we.only get one shot they'll never listen.to us again.but that business of questions to build.up confidence.and the way to learn.is.once you get a question you can't answer.you say to a friend look.i honestly i've never met that before i.don't know how to begin but i'd like to.think about it could we make for coffee.next tuesday evening.and i'll try and think it out people.think that's marvellous you'd actually.spend time in my question and then.you'll do some work i tell you.and you'll never forget the answer.and when you go and present it you'll.get another question and that's the way.to develop.ways of communicating with people that.are natural not preachy.as i said peter envisages.always be ready to give a reason to.people who ask you.so the onus is upon me to stimulate.questions.not a preacher people.does that make sense but honesty and.vulnerability is the main thing and it.can be very funny i give a lecture at.harvard to about two and a half thousand.students you can see it online and.they're quite clever some of them you.know and one of them stood up and he.asked me the most complicated question.imaginable that went on and on and when.he finished i looked at the audience and.i said does anybody have any idea what.on earth he's talking about.and the place erupted and that was the.end of it.okay.another one that's come up a few times.if god is in control of history.how do we see the world today and what.principles can we live by to understand.what's going on around us and especially.when bad things happen are those his.will.that's a virtually impossible question.to answer and you know it.because if you look at scripture you.think christianity started in the roman.empire.and paul and co lived under nero.well there's a bit of a problem for a.start.and.he said you must pray for kings and he.was referring to nero i think at the.time.and that sense of god appointing the.powers that be and yet and yet and yet.the apostles didn't believe in bowing.down to false spiritual authority that.commanded them to.deny the laws of god they were prepared.to go to prison for it.and it is very.very difficult.for us to second-guess the complexities.of god's way of governing the universe.if you don't believe that study.the lives in the old testament that the.new testament picks out as examples of.it.and one in particular is jacob.and his children.it is one of the most complex stories.that you'll ever read.because.jacob you remember.the parents were promised.that.it would be the younger but the father.didn't believe that and then the mother.saw things going down the drain so she.managed to.help jacob deceive his blind father.and so the will of god was done was it.but then jacob later was deceived.he wore a goatskin provided by his.mother and his father couldn't tell the.difference between his son and a goat.which is not very impressive.but then later on joseph's brothers.pretended he'd been murdered and they.took a goat skin and took joseph's coat.and covered it with goat's blood and so.jacob ended up being deceived by a goat.this shows the sophistication with the.way in which god.and i just can't second-guess it.but.within it.the question we need to ask since we.can't solve that problem is are there.enough reasons to trust god with it.that's the practical question.and i believe there are.how does one protest in the secular.university as you described.well as i said.we have to find our own way of doing it.and.the way i do it but that's not a.necessary for anybody else to follow.that i have publicly challenged.the dominant philosophy of naturalism.that is prevalent in universities in.many parts of the world and so i do it.by.entering into public well it used to be.debate but now it's much more dialogue.in getting these issues into the public.space.and letting people see that there is an.alternative.to what is being preached at them.through the media and so on and so forth.but.protest doesn't start at the public.level.all my interactions at the public level.have come out of the fact that i spend.an awful lot of time in my life talking.to individuals.you can't start at the public level.and there's no use protesting against.something if you're not standing for.something.because then you just seem like a.judgmental.so-and-so as we say back in.england.you've got to find out and i have a.great.confidence.through life's experience that if we're.open the lord will lead us.and to just my wife if she was here.she's a very shy person.she just says look.drop something about god into your.conversation and see what happens.if people pick it up you can pursue it.if they don't just let it go.and then you learn in that sense you're.pushing against you're swimming against.the flow.i was in the taxi here the other day.and the driver was swearing.every other word and i said excuse me.do you go to church he said sure.and i said you know the person you keep.referring to.means a tremendous lot to me.and if he were your friend you wouldn't.like me talking about that and he.profusely apologized he got it.immediately oh i said you know i never.thought of that.now that was a little protest it was a.very simple one but he's learned.something you see from it and we have to.learn in the little things.none of us ever start big i didn't start.by talking to crowds like this i started.by talking one on one.and that's where you gain authority.because you know what people think.because you've talked to them you just.haven't read books about what they think.you've talked to them.can you give some advice or insight.especially to younger people on an.approach to bible study how to get into.the bible we know it's valuable but.where do we start how do we get into it.there's no shortcut to that.you see.we've got to have a revolution.in our attitude to scripture a lot of.christians need to get converted.not.to receive forgiveness and salvation but.to change their minds radically about.what they think scripture is.you can never get anywhere by reading.the bible five minutes a night and.jumping into bed.especially young people.who are in education.you've got to learn to take scripture.seriously.and of course the first protest you get.in this century as i haven't enough time.and i say to people all right then go.home take a piece of paper.and honestly write down on it.the number of hours you spent this week.watching a screen.that has got nothing to do with either.your work your study or your christian.faith and then come back and tell me.you've no time.the huge number of hours that are wasted.with twittering and tweeting and.you know when i was young it was only.the birds that tweeted.and it is an absolute catastrophe.because the psychiatrists tell me that.young people are rewiring their brains.you cannot contain.a lot of information in 140 or 280.characters and that's what we're.training people to do now if we're going.to raise a generation of young people.that impact the society for god they'll.have to grow up and start taking god.seriously.and i'm just glad that i was taught to.do that when i was 14.and got into it.and i needed help.now.to begin to give you advice i just can't.do it in that limited space of time but.if you have a look at my website there's.a lot of stuff on there that might help.you john lennox.org.and if you read something like my book.on daniel you'll see see in it.the approach to scripture i was taught.but the man that helped me more than.anybody else is professor david gooding.and he has written a number of very.accessible books and you can even.download them free on the internet.and if you have a look at his book.according to luke you'll begin to see.how to get into scripture.and i know of no other way of doing it.than by doing it and if you can get help.and join a sensible bible study group.you see when i was a student i could see.that many people were carried along by.the size of the christian union when.they left university they disappeared.from the same because their faith was.never real they never learned to ask.questions so i started.running a bible study for students that.met for three hours a week on a sunday.afternoon and sometimes three hours to.wednesday night to really.get people into.taking scripture as seriously as they.took everything else.but i'm sorry there's no easy i mean.this is what you need a conference about.and even then.the real joy comes when you start doing.it and you ask god to speak to you.there's far too much in churches the day.of mugging up sermons from the internet.and you could tell in two minutes.whether people have been serious about.their preparation.and it's all the time and you know.the biggest reason for the emptying of.churches in.england is they don't answer questions.so it's good to be a church that answers.questions which you obviously are okay.yeah oh sure.sorry there's a whole lot of questions.about law.and they seem to be around the idea how.we.see statute law compared to christian.law and.if christian law is legislated if.christian standards of legislators leads.to trouble and so how do we understand.the distinction between the the two.if christian standards are legislated.that leads to trouble in the in the past.where christians you can be a specific.oh you mean when you get a kind of.theocracy where that is imposed oh well.that's that's a very useful corrective.to.false impressions that might have been.deduced from my minimalist approach.it is very important that.we're not living in a theocracy today.there is no christian country.and.what i'm talking about is much more.basic than that the basic.let me starting.another way.c.s lewis in the 1940s wrote a brilliant.book.called the abolition of man.very short book and it has an appendix.which he rather misleadingly calls it.tao.it doesn't mean taoism in china what he.means is.that as you look around.the different philosophies of religions.in the world.you find of course differences but the.remarkable thing is the amount of.commonality you find.and he calls it the tao and he points.out for instance that the golden rule as.we call it do unto others what you would.that they did to you.is to be founded every religion and.philosophy that there's ever been under.the sun and he quotes them all thousands.and thousands and dozens.and you see from my point of view that.is the biblical point of view i hope.the reason there is this commonality is.that we're hardwired for morality.we are rational beings but we're not.only rational beings we're moral beings.made in the image of god if we weren't.society would flow apart.and the idea of law didn't begin with a.codification of law either in the code.of hammurabi or in scripture.because.as the new testament.points out.there is something written on our heart.as we would say on our conscience that.we're aware of.and for centuries.by and large.the law of states has certainly in the.west in europe has followed that kind of.law that we recognize in the bible we're.not talking about things that are.specifically christian we're talking.about right and wrong.as intrinsic concepts once you start.imposing religious law whether it was.christian or sharia law and so on that.can lead to a lot of trouble.the problem comes as daniel indicates.when legislation is passed that begins.to change the basic parameters of.existence and redefine things that we.have accepted.as correct for centuries.and particularly in the area of human.relationships we know that that is.happening.and therefore.we have to do a lot of very hard.thinking we are required.by scripture to obey the powers that be.that's one side of it but when the.powers that they that where.commanded the apostles.to stop preaching for example they say.look whether it's right to listen to you.you have to judge but we're not going to.shut up.that was exceeding their powers.and the danger is that we're coming to a.point where.the state can exceed its powers now if.you are put in prison because you say.that a certain part of scripture is.still valid.well you have to go to prison there's no.way of avoiding it and there are people.sitting in prison in several european.countries precisely because they say.without being demagoguing about it that.scripture still applies today.so that is what i mean.the kind of imposition.as happened.in the middle ages.with remnants of it trailing down to my.country northern ireland.that's the thing that poses a problem i.mean many people say to me look you're.irish how on earth do you remain being.christian.because.people fight over it.as if they're trying to impose.christianity by force which some of them.their theology teaches them that and.unfortunately on both sides that comes.from constantine doesn't come from.scripture.and in that circumstance.you have to be very careful to explain.the christian attitude to violence.and when it comes to.if you like defending christ and his.message the answer is obvious.he tells you to put your sword away my.kingdom is not of this world otherwise.my servants would have been fighting.and it should be utterly obvious why.that is the case.pilate could see that.you see one of the things that interests.me about scripture is i used to wonder.there's a lot about the death and.resurrection of jesus in the new.testament but i could never understand.why there is so much about his trial.until.i met the christopher hitchens of this.world.and suddenly realized.that christ was accused of terrorism.that's exactly what he was accused of.fomenting political terrorism.and that trial then becomes crucially.important what is the christian stance.and pilate who was no fool.conducted the trial himself he didn't.even have a trial lawyer he did it.himself because it was such a sensitive.case.was this person a threat.to the rule of rome.are you a king well not in the way you.mean said jesus my kingdom isn't of this.world otherwise my servants would have.been fighting.to this end i was born and to this end i.came into the world so that i should.bear witness to the truth.and pilot hardened soldier that he was.what is truth and he went out and said.jesus was innocent.he realized what all of us need to.realize that the one thing you cannot do.with violence is impose truth.especially if it's truth about.forgiveness the love of god peace with.god and salvation.and we need that message in our.societies today my country still needs.it although it's much more peaceful than.it was.it is so important that we realize that.the new testament deals with things and.because we look into the past we talk.about.the.uh trial of christ as if it was not.relevant to the 21st century it's.totally relevant it's a terrorist trial.that makes a big difference to me.if that makes sense to you.maybe we need to stop it's over half an.hour.well i'm happy to stop but thank you.very much ladies and gentlemen for your.questions and for listening and.you know where there's more information.on daniel.and there are several books there's one.coming out soon on joseph.so thanks a lot and god bless you all.thank you.sorry.please.[Applause].i just

gentle ways to.begin to communicate to our society.around us.we pray for this church and its.ministers and the teams of people.involved in the bible study.that have.organized this evening we commit them to.you the young people that are with us.tonight.open their minds and eyes.and teach them how to get to know you.and your word better.and equip them to witness to a world of.increasing
