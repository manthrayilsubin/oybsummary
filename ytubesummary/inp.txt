it's part of the law that teaches us.what.is what sin is and uh not observing the.Sabbat it's like um not.observing any other uh command of the.law this is my I know the argument.Exodus 28-11 I understand but that shows.you don't understand what the point is.no one says we don't observe the sabbath.I observe the sabbath you don't observe.the true Sabbath that's the debate.that's what people don't understand when.I tell them can can we talk about this.yeah well you have to talk about it.because you want me to follow Israel's.Sabbath no and I follow God's Sabbath.which Israel Sabbath was modeled after.and Matthew 24:20 doesn't help your case.that shows you don't read.context yes right can you listen a.little I don't know if I listen I want.to see your evidence I mean I don't want.you to preach you're not here to preach.okay no no in Exodus 20 28 to1 I just.told you Exodus that you you you told.earlier that is the Jew Sabbath but yes.it is but uh there is not Jesus who.gives this law and with anything the.same Jesus also gave circumcision to.Abraham right yes and so then Jesus came.and said we Gentiles don't get.circumcised so you're not you're not.making any sense.uh he did he didn't um abolish. yes he did Acts chapter 15 yes he.did but we need to circumcise our hearts.so you you just proved my point see you.don't know my point Thank you for.proving my point You just prove physical.circumcision is a shadow of the reality.of spiritual circumcision yes thank you.just proved my point but you don't.understand my point that's exactly my.argument your Sabbath is is like.physical circumcision it's pointing to a.greater.reality physical circumcision points to.spiritual circumcision yes your Sabbath.points to God's Sabbath what are you not.getting.uh you just made my point you know that.right uh I know but um but before you.move on I'm not trying to cut you up you.understand you just proved my point what.my point was or no you don't get it I.get it that you I that you think that Al.of the saath it's gone in the spirit in.the spiritual real I don't think Exodus.20 told you that if you read Exodus 20 8.to11 God says you keep the Sabbath.because God kept the Sabbath I didn't.say that the Ten Commandments said it.open up Exodus 20 and I'll read it for.you want me read it for you yes I I will.read it this is why when people chime in.on my comment section they get me upset.because they don't understand the point.I'm making they think they do and they.think they're refusing not saying you.I'm talking them yeah okay no matter how.many times I tell them you don't get the.point you're going to embarrass yourself.they don't listen but here I'm going to.show you so guys you heard what he said.he he made my point I just want to.repeat what he said he said didn't Jesus.give the Ten Commandments the Sabbath.yeah the same Jesus who gave to Abraham.physical circumcision he said yeah we.still keep it it's spiritual.circumcision.Bingo physical circumcision pointed to a.greater reality spiritual circumcision.likewise the Sabbath of Israel is a.shadow of the true reality the true.Sabbath God Sabbath and just like New.Testament believers they get spiritually.circumcised New Testament followers of.Jesus who are not Jews follow God's.Sabbath that's my point but let me get.the passage so we can talk about.it it's hard why people don't figure out.what I'm trying to say but it's okay.here I want you to see Israel Sabbath is.modeled after who Sabbath Exodus 20: 8.to1 this is the Ten commands.people like we don't follow here you go.Exodus 20 8 to1 remember the Sabbath day.to keep it holy six days you shall labor.and do all your work but the seventh day.is the Sabbath of Yahweh your God in it.you shall do no you shall not do any.work you are your son or your daughter.your male or your female slave or your.cattle or your Sojourner who's within.your gates for in six days Yahweh see.here's the point the reason why you keep.the Sab because Yahweh work six days and.keep Sabbath for in six days Yahweh made.the heavens and the earth and the Sea.and all that is in them and rested on.the seventh day therefore Yahweh blessed.the Sabbath day made it holy so I just.want to know from you does God keeps the.Sabbath day of Israel so that they work.six days seventh day comes ends and they.work six days and seven days is that the.Sabbath that God.keeps uh in in a way yes no no brother.no because John.5 John 5:1.1718 when the Jews told Jesus that he's.violating the Sabbath he goes my father.works even on this day I too I'm working.so Jesus says no he doesn't keep the.Sabbath of Israel because he and the.father work on the Sabbath of Israel.John five read it open up John five read.16-18 I want to put it on the screen so.no in a way no that's wrong here John 5.16 to8 no he doesn't keep your Sabbath.John 51618 I'm going to put it on the.screen so you can see here you go.uhhuh here you go John 516 to18 here you.go Jesus himself the same Jesus you said.who gave the.Sabbath oh it's this guy look at this.dude hold on they were angry that Jesus.healed a man on the Sabbath and for this.reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus.because he was doing these things on the.Sabbath but he answered them my father.is working until now and I myself am.working no he does not keep the Sabbath.of Israel he works on the Sabbath of.Israel as Jesus does for this reason.therefore the Jews were seeking all the.more to kill him.because he Not only was breaking the.Sabbath but also was calling God his own.father making himself equal to God so.why would you tell me that God keeps.Israel's Sabbath Jesus said no we.don't also Jesus accuses um the Jews.that they did they not keep Sabbath.brother you're changing the subject.don't I I come back I come back now no.stay here does the father work on the.Sabbath uh yes the father does his work.on the Sabbath yes okay so God does not.keep your Sabbath what Sabbath does he.keep it keep it keeps my Sabbath because.the command is not against God's work is.it's against my work you understand.let's try this again Jesus said God does.not keep your Sabbath which is a Sabbath.of Israel that's what you're saying you.keep so what Sabbath does God.keep the Sabbath of Israel because just.a moment just a moment please please I'm.ask you no I'm gonna ask you third time.I just quoted Jesus saying he doesn't.keep the Sabbath of Israel you want me.to read it.again God does not keep the Sabbath.given to Israel that's John 51618 you.want me to read it again okay so what.Sabbath does God keep it was in Exodus.20 vers 11 but you're so stubborn you.don't want to admit it.that sorry can we go back where you said.that Jesus tells that um he does not not.keep Sabbath in the John.buddy the Jews are saying Jesus is.breaking the Sabbath because they think.he's a Jew and just a man and he ask the.rest his point is no you.Jews must keep the Sabbath but God works.on the Sabbath because there's not a day.that God doesn't work to preserve.creation so God is not bound to keep the.Sabbath of Israel a Jew keeps it but God.is free from that Sabbath of Israel and.that's what Jesus is showing them I am.one with the father and being one with.the father I am God and God is free to.work on the Sabbath but not you if.you're a Jew so going back to the point.he does not keep the Sabbath given to.Israel what Sabbath does God.keep his Sabbath which one his and when.did his Sabbath.begin uh in day seven day seven after he.finished creation right yeah did his.Sabbath.end uh no so is today God's.Sabbath God God is God is in Sabbath is.today his Sabbath yes is tomorrow God's.Sabbath um.yes will the day after be God's Sabbath.yes from this point of view yes until.the end of the age right yes exactly and.also after no because it's a new Heaven.new Earth he's going to create again.Isaiah.65:17 don't misquote to me Isaiah 66.please no no no no and Isaiah 65:17.God's going to create again he will.create a new Heaven and Earth that means.his Sabbath will end because he's now.going to create again a new Heaven new.earth Isaiah 6517 let me post it for you.no I no no not not this text I want I.want um to post another brother be.patient God cannot create a new Heaven.new Earth if he his Sabbath continues in.the age to come because Sabbath began.because he stopped creating but in.Isaiah 65:17 he says behold I am.creating a new heavens and earth that.means he has to end his Sabbath to.create again.I understand and I think sabath is going.to end at the End of the Age I I think I.have a text that maybe contradicts your.point no you're not you're contradicting.this passage but go ahead let's see what.that passage you're gonna quote uh can.you read for me Colossians 2 16 and 17.big mistake to qu Colossians 216 to 18.you're making my point big mistake you.sure you want to call that you're making.my point yes yes please quote okay no.it's no problem I'm open to change it's.no problem no Watch How I just proved my.point he's going to quote Colossians.26-18 especially Colossians 216 to 17.here brother you're I was I was thinking.you're going to refute me but you're.helping me refute you here no problem no.you're a good man I want you to come.fullness of Truth this is the one he.quotes look at this guys therefore no.one is to judge you in food and drink or.in respect to a festival new moon or a.Sabbath day why things which are only a.music to my ears of what is to come but.the substance belongs to Christ what are.you not getting that this proved my.point that the Sabbath is not the.reality it's a shadow who's the who's.the.reality you're telling me that God's.Sabbath today it's a it's a shadow of.the read it the verse said it it's in.front of you man things which are only a.shadow that's talking about the Sabbath.and the festivals of Israel.you just made my point a that's exactly.what I've been saying the festivals of.Israel the holidays of Israel the.sabbaths of Israel are a shadow they're.not the reality the reality is Christ.now the reality come we follow the.reality you want me to follow the.shadow.exactly I understand your point you read.it right in front of you right look did.Paul say.your Sabbath that you're keeping is just.the.shadow yes so who's the.reality who's the reality.readed Jesus so why you taking me back.to the shadow I now have the reality I.have Christ you can stay in the shadow.if you want I'm going to go to the.reality so you can stay in the shadow.you can stay I understand uh but why do.I I still know not understand maybe you.explain me why do you think that.um to be in Jesus.Christ implies not keeping Sabbath no no.no no no no what wrong we keep God's.Sabbath not Israel's Sabbath this where.you keep getting me confused I am the.true Sabbath keeper because the moment I.trust in Christ I have entered God's.rest that's Hebrews 4: 1-1 I don't enter.Israel's rest when I believe in that's.I'm not telling that's Hebrews 4 veres.1-1 he says by faith you enter God's.Sabbath so when I trust in Christ that's.when I enter the real Sabbath and now in.that Sabbath I rest in Christ but to.rest in Christ is to cling to Christ to.obey Christ because there is no peace.disobeying Christ so now I look at what.Jesus says about the days of worship now.as a gentile now that I've entered.Sabbath and my Sabbath I keep and.maintain by being faithful to Christ not.like the Jews who when they didn't.believe they were cut off from God's.rest if you want to remain in that rest.of God the Sabbath God you need to be.faithful to Christ to be faithful to.Christ just to obey him so now I look to.the New Testament and it tells me what I.do what I don't do so the New Testament.now tells me you Gentile you don't need.to get physically circumcised you.Gentile the only thing you don't e is.animal with blood in it and sacrificed.Idols you want to bring me back to the.shadow I don't want the shadow I want.the.reality and what is your opinion about.Paul.um tell me how it spelled correctly Cy.circumcision yes.Timothy what what do you want to tell me.about Paul who said Titus did not get.circumcised here I know what you're.talking about acts 16 13 I'll tell you.why I know the answer here let me show.you so now either Paul contradicts.himself or you still do not understand.my position which is okay I'm going to.help you why did Paul have Timothy get.circumcised because he was Jewish his.mother was Jewish and the Jews they.would keep Sabbath and circumcision and.kosher but we're not talking about if.you are physically Jewish we're talking.about Gentile Titus who was a gentile.did not get circumcised why show it to.you but let's read what you're quoting.to me acts 15 I mean acts 16: 1 and.3 now Paul also arrived at derba acts 16.veres 1 and3 and at lisra and behold a.disciple was there named Timothy the son.of a Jewish woman who was a Believer but.his father was a Greek and he was well.spoken of by the brothers lisra and.eonian so his mother was what Jewish.right the that's why he got circumcised.because he had Jewish blood Paul wanted.this man to go with him but he took him.and circumcised him because of the Jews.or in those parts for they all knew that.his father was a Greek but now watch.Titus Galatians 2 verses 1 and3 Titus.who had no Jewish blood his mother.wasn't Jewish his father wasn't Jewish.he refused to get circumcised and Paul.said good for you here it is Galatians 2.verses 1 and 3 Galatians 2 veres 1 and 3.then after 14 years I went up again to.Jerusalem with Barnabas taking Titus.along also and I went up because of a.relation and I allow and I laid out to.them the gospel which I preached among.the Gentiles see those are not.ethnically Jewish but I did so in.private to those who are of reputation L.somehow I might be running or had run in.vain but not even Titus who was with me.though he was a Greek was compelled to.be circumcised so how come Titus didn't.get circumcised.Obi here it is verse three.let me yes because because he was a.gentile yes course that's my point I am.not ethnically Jewish I'm a gentile stop.telling me to follow the Sabbath of the.ethnic Jews my circumcision is spiritual.my Sabbath is spiritual I keep spiritual.circumcision spiritual Sabbath not.physical circumcision and not the.Sabbath given to the physical Jews.that's not my Covenant as a.gentile but you want to make me a Jew.[Music].now it comes in the in mind in my mind.the problem with the threee and the.branches that were foreign branches that.was yeah but Israel was cut off right R.yes but but it it will be brought back.no well brought back to be part of the.church not as a nation that's the point.of Romans 11 but that's another topic.because the same Paul who told you.Gentiles are engrafted in he's the one.who's saying Gentiles don't get.circumcised that's Paul in fact in.Romans 2 he says the true circumcision.is spiritual and a true Jew is inward.not outward the same Paul here because.you're quoting Romans 11 here it is.Romans 2 so I can't quote Paul talking.about oh Gentiles have been grafted in.and the same Paul says you Gentiles you.are circumcised spiritually you are Jews.spiritually you don't need to be.physical Jews to get circumcised.physically or you don't need physical.circumcision here Romans 2 28 to 29 here.St.Paul so I am a spiritual Jew not a.physical Jew I'm a gentile I don't keep.the Sabbath of Israel I keep God's.Sabbath when I trust in Christ and enter.God's rest and I keep spiritual.circumcision not physical circumcision.this is where the sabbatarians don't.understand the Bible here Romans.22829 for he is not a Jew who is one.outwardly nor circumcision that which is.outward in the flesh but he is the Jew.who is one inwardly inside and.circumcision is that which is of the.Heart by the spirit end of story so you.want me to be a physical Jew not by the.letter and his PR is not from men but.from God and you want me to keep the.shadow you can be a physical Jew and you.can keep the shadow I'm a spiritual Jew.and I keep the reality not the Shadow.and another question uh what do you say.about Jesus uh about um uh also U Luke I.think look in 16 and 21 Jesus what no.acts please open acts yeah I know Act 7.to to 53 Act 7 okay Act seven what you.want me I know what you're going but go.what verses.again uh 53 53 53 yeah okay.yeah they received the law as ordained.by angels yet did not observe observe it.okay what about it h you you keep.telling me that the Sabbath is Jew yes.and the Jew kept it but the Bible uh.accused them that they have not kept.them yeah because that's why God.replaced them with the Gentiles so you.made my point again why do you think God.rejected them because they couldn't keep.the law so then he brought a new law the.law of Christ and he brought a new.people the church that's the.message okay can I show you that from.Jesus you're you're making my point.Israel because they could not keep the.law God said enough is enough I'm done.with you so here's what Jesus says.what's going to happen Matthew 21 37- 44.here so so now there's a new Israel the.church there's a new law the law of.Christ there's a new circumcision that's.spiritual there's a new Sabbath the.Sabbath of God that we enter through.faith in Christ that's exactly the point.of the New Testament here Jesus he gives.a parable the owner of the vineyard he.sent Servants of prophets some they kill.some they reject now watch Matthew 21.37-39 Matthew 21 37- 39 but afterward he.sent his son to them saying they will.respect my son but when the vine Growers.saw the son they said among themselves.this is the air it's Matthew 21 3739.come let us kill him and seize his.inheritance and they took him and threw.him out of the vineyard and killed him.therefore when the owner of the Vineyard.comes Matthew 2137 to 44 what will he do.to those Vine Growers they said to.him he will bring the these wretches to.a wretched end and will rent out the.vineyard to others he's going to take it.away from him give it to someone else.will pay him the proceeds that the.proper Seasons now watch this who is.these others and who are they replacing.here you go Matthew 21 37- 44 and that's.what Paul says in Romans 11 the Gentiles.have been engrafted in the Jews have.been cut off here you go here it is.Matthew 2137 and 44 Jesus said to them.did you never read in the scriptures the.stone which the Builders rejected this.became the Chief.Cornerstone this came about from the.Lord and it is marvelous in our eyes now.watch therefore I say to you the kingdom.of God will be taken away from you from.who from thew so why do you want me to.be a Jew and stay in the Old.Testament and given to a.nation producing the fruit of it and he.who falls on the stone will be broken to.Pieces but whoever it falls it will.scatter him like dust so Jesus just said.old Covenant is done I'm not taking the.kingdom away from you I'm going to give.it to another Nation old Covenant is.done it's now a New Covenant of a new.Israel a new community who are spiritual.Jews spiritually circumcised who keep.the true Sabbath not the shadow that's.the message of the New Testament you you.just another two points and and then I I.leave you okay thank you brother uh uh.it will take one I think more 10 minutes.I want you to explain to me okay okay.good I'll try uh you spoke uh in your.word old Covenant which means the on the.sign know the what the the Sinai the.Covenant yes the it's the old Covenant.yes it's made on Sinai yes yes and the.New.Covenant we first first we first uh.learn about New Covenant in Isaiah then.in Ezekiel.36 it's Prophet isite no it's Prophet.like be.careful Isaiah 66 are you refering to.Isaiah.66 yes yes you sure you want to use that.yes yeah I I I want to learn I'll I'll.teach okay if you read Isaiah 6 I know.what you're referring to Isaiah 6617 and.24 right you can put it yeah I'll put it.but you're reading Isaiah 6617 to 24.right yes I just talks about keeping the.Sabbath and whoever eats rats and Swine.they'll be unclean.right I'll put it there but that's when.look at Isaiah 6617 to 24 I know what.you're referring to because look what.you just did you just destroyed the New.Testament I don't want to do that no I.know you don't that's why I'm helping.you not to do that but in Isaiah 6617 to.24 this is what you're referring to.where it says they'll keep it from east.to west Sabbath they'll be keeping.Sabbath and anyone who eats a rat or.they'll be unclean and they'll be.defiled right no no no no no no no no no.just let me open my was that one you're.referring to about the Covenant Isaiah.66 no no no which Ezekiel Ezekiel 36 I.know 24 but you said Isaiah it's it's.related to Isaiah what just me yeah give.me the Isaiah one because Ezekiel 36.doesn't say it's the Mosaic law give me.the one Isaiah because I thought you.just open open open my my.Bible if it's Isaiah 661 17 to 24 maybe.that's the one let me.know no he's not Jewish guys he's not.he's not ethnically Jewish he got caught.into the Sabbath teaching he's not.Jewish I know this guy reached out to me.he was sincere that's why I told him.come next time go Ahad uh uh Isaiah.44 okay well okay what about Isaiah 44.have you read Isaiah.424 uh Isaiah 44 I think this is where.the New Covenant is prophetis no.actually I'll tell you where the new.covenants prophesied Isaiah 42:6 and.Isaiah.49:8 42 verse 6 and Isaiah 49.ver8 that's where the Covenants.prophesied.yes okay you see verse six what does it.say yes I see I will put you I will I.come I call you to give a covenant to.the yes a covenant why don't you read.verse four because it says you're going.to trust in his Torah the word law means.Torah not Moses's Torah but his Torah.the servants Torah how come you didn't.read that read verse four here I'm G to.put on the.screen behold my servant whom I uphold.My Chosen One and whom my soul soul is.well pleased I have put my spirit upon.Him He will bring forth Justice to the.Nations he will not cry out or raise his.voice nor make his voice heard in the.street a crushed Reet he will not break.and a faintly burning Wick he will not.extinguish he will bring forth Justice.and Truth Now watch here he will not be.faint or crushed until he establish.justice in the earth and the coastlands.will expectedly wait for his Torah his.law the word is Torah whose Torah are.you going to.follow Jesus but you want me to follow.the Torah of.Moses.uh this is not going into my head why.you tell is the Torah of Moses not the.Torah of Jesus sin the Old Testament.says this is the law of Moses yes we.know Jesus gave it but it was the law.given by Moses but then Jesus came to.Earth Earth to give us his laww meaning.the law given to Jesus when he came to.Earth to establish a New.Covenant because here it says whose law.are you going to follow the law of the.servant Isaiah 42 who's the servant.Matthew 12 tells you that's.Jesus it's right there verse four they.will wait for his law the word law is.tor who my servant meaning Jesus and.Matthew 12 says this is Jesus yes so.when Jesus came to Earth he came to give.you his law not the law that he gave.through Moses why do you think Paul says.I'm under the law of Christ here 1.Corinthians.9 1 Corinthians.9 21 here what law does Paul follow here.1 Corinthians.9:21 here you go right here in front of.us 1 Corinthians.9:21 to those who are without law I.acted as if I didn't have law though not.being without the law of God but under.the law of Christ that's Isaiah 4214 the.servant came Jesus and he gave us his.law so I Paul follow the law that Christ.came to give when he became Flesh on.Earth okay now let me give you another.one that you're under the law of.Christ Galatians 6.verse2 Galatians 6 6 verse2 here you.go Galatians 6 verse two here you.go bear one another's burdens and so.fulfill the law of.who of Christ why do you want me to take.me back to.saai did you know what Paul said about.saai you want me to show you want me to.shock you what Paul said about the.siai yes you know what he said about it.he goes That's Hagar and.ishma.he said the law on Arabia that's Hagar.and Ishmael children of slavery so you.want to make me a slave not a son here.let me show it to you Galatians 4 21- 26.and we're going to read all the way to.31 Galatians 4 21 to 26 but we're going.to read all the way to 31 you ready yeah.remember you said the law at saai right.yeah and Paul says that law is.Hagar yeah so you want to be a son of.Hagar or a son of Sarah uh just a.question they they are.slaves but he's saying if you follow the.law of Moses you are a slave a son of.Hagar you're not a son of.Abraham we're here not me here read it.Galatians 4 21-31 here you go tell me.you who want to be under the law see.that's what you're telling me I need to.be under the law the Sabbath do you not.listen to the law for it's written that.Abraham had two sons that's in Genesis.that's part of the law one by the.servant woman and one by the free woman.but the son by the servant woman had.been born according flesh meaning it.wasn't God's will it was Sarah who got.desperate so they did something in the.flesh right yeah Isaac was God's will.but while the son by the free woman.through the props now watch this is.spoken with allegory he's saying Hagar.and Sarah they are an allegory a picture.of something greater their picture of.what this is spoken with allegory for.these women are covenants aha Sarah is a.covenant Hagar is a covenant Hagar is.what Covenant one from Mount.saai bearing children into slavery she.is Hagar you are a son of Hagar you're.not a son of Sarah because you want to.bind me to the law of saai.why why are you doing that to.me I think uh my understanding of this.uh is that they could they couldn't keep.the law which is the same law because.they didn't have uh the spirit of God.the spirit of God who um.fulfilled um God's wish in Jesus because.Jesus came to us to be like us like men.and through help of um the the Holy.Spirit he kept he kept the Commandments.because he he also also tells us that um.I came down not to abolish the law.you're misquoting Matthew 5 Obie I know.what Matthew 5 says that's not what he.means but you're forgetting the cons of.Galatians see this is why you need to.he's not talking about time of Moses.he's talking to people at his time there.were Jews telling Gentiles you you need.to keep the law of Moses circumcision.Paul says if you do that you become a.son of Hagar that's Galatians you're.ignoring the context let me explain the.Contex Galatians Jesus has come there.are Jews who are like you who are saying.you Gentiles you got to get circumcised.and you got to keep the law of Moses.Paul says no you don't need to get.circumcised you don't need to keep the.law of Moses you keep the law of Christ.and that does not include circumcision.you remember when I read Galatians 2.where it says Titus not get circumcised.this is the same Titus the same.Galatians they if I remember well uh.they uh decide to not get Gentile.circumcised only because they don't want.to put any more burden on them just like.you're trying to put a burden on me.thank.you.oh exactly I understand I understand.your.he's not talking to these Gentiles.you're not Jewish you're a gentile right.yes yes course but Paul said why do you.want to be a son of.Hagar he's talking to you Galatians 4 is.about us Gentiles he's saying AI why do.you want to be a son of Hagar because.when you tell me I gotta follow the law.of Moses that law on that's Hagar I.don't want to be a son of Hagar I want.to be a son of Sarah like Isaac born of.the spirit so stop trying to make me a.son of Hagar are that's Paul saying it.to.you I understand good last last one and.okay that's a good okay and maybe we.talk another time um this is related.with Sabbath it's not it's about the.Sunday what do you think about Sunday.keeping then oh very.easy if we believe Christ is guarding.the church right yes the Bible says that.Christ has appointed Bishops and these.Bishops were appointed by the spirit at.the hands of the Apostles right yes so.you will find that the very Disciples of.the Apostles being taught by the.apostles binding Christians to gather on.Sunday why to celebrate the fact that.our.freedom our.Salvation was brought about by the.resurrection of Christ so they gathered.on Sunday to honor that here let me give.you an article I'm not making up have.you heard of G.Ignatius.that's why you need to know your church.history brother.Ignatius is a disciple of the Apostles.Peter Paul John he met them and he.mentions them he was the bishop of.Antioch Syria and Antioch Syria he was.the bishop appointed by the apostles he.wrote seven letters to churches to the.Ephesians Philippians like Paul did as.he's being taken to Rome to be.killed and he being appointed by the.apostles says that all the churches.started by the apostles were taught to.gather on Sunday to honor the Lord's.Resurrection here's the article and I'm.going to read from him here it is I'm G.to read from him so in the private chat.there's the article for everyone let me.show it to you and I'm going to read.what he.says so the very Disciples of the.apostles who are Gentiles.say we follow worship on Sunday because.our Lord conquered death and saved us by.his resurrection so that's why we got.there on Sunday here let me show it to.you so you don't think I'm making it up.so now either you're going to tell me.the Disciples of the apostles who knew.the apostles who were trained by them.got it wrong or you're wrong my brother.here it is let me show you the article I.gave you the link and I'm going to put.the quote you guys see.it okay there's the link now let me.quote Ignatius look what he.says okay ignatious and there's others.here it.is watch what he says.epistle to the magnesians and he's one.of many I give you many others but here.that's why we do Sunday because the.Church of the Apostles the Bishops.appointed by the apostles the ones that.Paul said were made Bishops by the Holy.Spirit to guard the church said the.practice of the churches is to gather on.Sunday to honor the Lord who conquered.death for us here it is chapter nine let.us live with Christ if therefore those.who are brought up in the ancient or.things have come to the possession of a.new hope no longer observing the.Sabbath white Ignatius you're a bishop.of Antioch where they were first called.Christians in Acts 11 you're eyewitness.to the apostles you were trained by.Peter Paul and John you're telling me.that you were taught to teach the.churches you don't observe the sabbath.of Israel but living in the observance.of the Lord's day that's why Sunday was.called the Lord's Day day on which also.our life has sprung up because that's.the day he rose from the dead.guaranteeing our salvation by him and by.his death whom some deny by which.mystery we have obtained faith and.therefore endure that we may be found.Disciples of Jesus Christ Our Only.Master how shall we be able to live.apart from him whose disciples the.prophets themselves in the spirit did.wait for him as their teacher even the.Old Testament prophets were his.disciples they're waiting for him and.therefore whom they rightly waited for.having come raised them from the dead a.epistle to.magnesians I understand uh can you open.um the I have here the catechism of.Catholic sure go ahead what do you want.from it uh you on Vatican on the Vatican.official site okay yeah fine go ahead.catechism uh where it po uh the third.the third what the point because I.didn't go to the C I went to Ignatius I.went to the.Bible I I want to read you two quotes.from the two two quotes from the.catechism and then make one point and.that's all in the the catechism of.Catholic church where you find the Ten.Commandments and commandment number.three.uh.2173 article says like this the gospel.reports many incidents when Jesus was.accused of violating the Sabbath law but.Jesus never fails to respect the.Holiness of this.day he giv who denies that you didn't.understand my.point just I must I I must read it to.yeah go from me yeah okay and I I make.one point and you answer and okay yes.that's fine so he give his law in its.out he gives this law its authentic and.author authorative interpretation the.wait wait say it again see this what you.didn't understand he gave the law what.the authorative authoritative inter in.other words he is explaining its true.meaning yes correct correct the Sabbath.was made for men not men for the Sabbath.exactly with compassion Christ declares.the Sabbath for doing good rather than.harm amen for saving life rather than.killing Hallelujah the Sabbath is the.day of the Lord of.mercies and a day to honor.God to honor God yes but here you agree.with me that this um uh this part it's.talking specifically about the Sab the.Sabbath day of which um Jesus is.accused of not.keeping is not the the um Sabbath that.came after.the yeah and the the.catechism uh um tells us that Jesus.skied the Sabbath mhm and another the.next quote I want uh if you just put the.next.page uh we read from the last part of.article.2174 when the church explain why the.church keeps the.day yes okay uh.we a little bit higher article I yeah.what about that I know what you're know.but ask me your question so I can show.you what they're trying to tell you we.all gather on the day of the.Sun the day of the Sun for it is the.first day after the Jewish sabbath but.also the first day when God this.separating matter from Darkness made the.world and on the same day Jesus Christ.Our Savior rose from the dead mhm Sunday.is fulfillment of Sabbath see you just.made my point Y yes yes yes correct um.in and in article.2175 Sunday is.expressly distinguished from the Sabbath.which is followed chronologically every.week for the Christian is C ceremonial.observance replaces the Sabbath yep is.Christ Passover and they fulfill the.spiritual truth of the The Jewish.Sabbath and announces meant Eternal rest.in God like you said for.worship um under the law prepared for.the my mystery of Christ that um what.was done and and yeah by the way Rory uh.Walter V is a joke if he convinced you.then that means you don't know church.history or the Bible his errors and lies.are pitiful he's a joke don't ever.insult us to say he compelling he's a.joke but go.ahead yeah uh the last part.yeah the celebration.2176 the celebration of Sunday observe.observes the moral commandment is the.moral commandment inscribed by nature in.the human heart this is speaking about.Sunday to rer it says I'm just waiting.for your question to render to God just.to know others what we are speaking.about uh to render to God on outward Vis.visible public and regular worship as a.sign of his Universe beneficial to.all uh my point is reading two articles.is that Jesus kept the literal Sabbath.this is the church teaching in the.catechism and.um oh yeah uh you read the rest of it.right yes and so you forgot the rest of.it where it says though he observed the.Sabbath to bring out a true meaning it's.now fulfilled in.him where Passover is fulfilled in.him where is that 2174 and 175 176 if.you read in context they just told you.though Jesus observed the Sabbath to.show its true meaning it's now fulfilled.in him.and because it's fulfilled in him and.it's fulfilled in him and that he is our.rest who washered in our rest by the.Resurrection on Sunday so Sunday becomes.our Sabbath it says it right there just.like Passover did Jesus observe the.Passover yes so do you now observe the.Passover like the Jews no but why Jesus.observed the.Passover I I observed it in that day.the it the way Jews do with four cops.and Ma Aiken and.Mato no no we don't sacrifice.lamb Jesus observed.it because the point is the things he.observed then he fulfilled and now that.he fulfilled it we follow his.fulfillment of it not the way they Jews.did here it even gave gave you that you.missed it here 2 2175 here right here it.said it yes Jesus kept Passover he got.circumcised he kept Sabbath but he did.that until it was fulfilled in his death.and Resurrection now that he's fulfilled.it we follow his fulfillment of it not.the shadow here Sunday is expressly.distinguished from the Sabbath which it.follows chronologically every week for.Christians it simar obser replaces that.of the Sabbath and Christ's.Passover Sunday fulfills the spiritual.truth of The Jewish Sabbath why didn't.you understand what they were telling.you I I I understand what and now.announces man's Eternal rest in God for.worship under the law prepared Shadow.remember I said Shadow for the mystery.of Christ and what was done there.prefigured meaning pointed to some.aspect of Christ they told you he now.ful fulfilled it now we F we follow the.reality that's Colossians 26- 17 so.finish their.point um to me what the church did with.this what church I gave you.Ignatius yes the the early church okay.what Ignatius is a disciple of John.Peter and Paul yes so he was.wrong uh just just let me tell you to.finish the point and then you I will.tell if I think he wrong you have to.finish a point when I tell you Ignatius.was appointed by Peter Paul and John and.he met them you have no point because.you're saying that the church became.corrupt and it failed so where is the.Holy Spirit to protect this.church selatan B shut your mouth you.filthy bastard you son of the devil you. son of a stop barking you.son of the devil come and do a better.job because we've had a 200 com but I'll.bury you in your fake God you scum.son of of the devil on you sorry brother.this guy's a dog no problem so did the.Holy Spirit fail and that when Paul says.to the Bishops in Acts 20.25-32 the Holy Spirit made you Bishops.to protect the flock from wolves.Ignatius was one of those Bishops.appointed by the apostles and he says we.observe Sunday and all the churches did.and they got this from the apostles so.you're saying Christ failed I dangerous.no no I I I only want to suggest that.uh Holy Spirit cannot.teach against earlier another teaching.that the early earlier teaching oh wow.so when the Holy Spirit said gets.circumcised physically then he tells the.Gentiles don't get circumcised.physically so you just have the Holy.Spirit contradicting himself God forbid.listen to yourself no because uh like.you tell it's to it's another type of.circumcises it changed do you have to.get circumcised physically no but I but.I I be because I have to get circumcised.it in my heart that's not what he told.Abraham he said you got to get phys.physically circumcised yes but after.after the the gospel after the gospel.was thank you after Jesus after Jesus.they they do not want to put an a.another extra burden just like you're.putting an extra burden Me by making me.a son of Hagar because you want me to.follow the law given at sa so now we're.back to the first.point but no you can be a son of Hagar.brother peace be with you be a son of.Hagar I'll be a son of s uh do I want to.ask you meta you are a and Son of.a you filthy bastard you're not.Ethiopian return to your vomit you.bastard sorry brother go ahead no no.problem.uh I want to just ask you a question.maybe rhetorically well you've asked me.for two hours brother so we're going to.go in circles the fact is Galatians 4.says you're a son of Hagar stay under.the law at sa I'll be a son of Sarah do.what you want uh don't you think the.church starting after the apostles did.exactly what the Jews no did no because.Jesus accused them no I just said no you.want to hear my answer because Jesus.said he'll be building his church and.the spirit will guide the church so that.the True Believers will always be there.to expose the false teachers but the.True Believers were ignatious and he's.the one exposing false teachers and he.said you're a false teacher because you.want me to keep the.Sabbath I but to keep the sun to keep.the Sunday none of the Apostles teach.not Jesus teach not suggested not yeah.okay now show me where Jesus said keep.the Sabbath and the Apostle said keep.the Sabbath and those exact words show.me where they said in those exact words.you now who follow Jesus keep the.Sabbath don't argue from Silence show me.where they said to keep it.well from your expose Jesus said at the.siai and in the Old Testament keep my.Sabbath all the the SI that Paul says.means that you're a son of Hagar game.over buddy you are a son of AAR you're.an ishite you're not a Christian game.over brother Paul says you're a heretic.you're son of ishma son of Hagar you're.not a Christian you're not a son of.Sarah that's your problem go read.Galatians 431 we're.done brother we're done God bless you.God bless you bye bye bye bye there you.go so he's a son of Hagar he's a son of.ishmail and you bastards you guys who.are barking you are sons of spiritual. you are scum of the earth I'll.bear you your false gods and I will.destroy you you filthy scum of the earth.don't act Brave in the comments section.you filthy dogs anyway so for the rest.of you I hope you learn he's a son of.Hagar he's a son of Ishmael he's not a.son of Sarah he's not a son of.Abraham I tried he was torturing me.because keeps reading and I know the.point but I hope you the rest of.you were you benefited from this I hope.now you see sabbatarians have no case.you understand sabbatarians have no case.they don't know the Bible they can't.defend their.perversion they cannot defend Sabbath.observance the New Testament is their.enemy it destroys their satanic.doctrines they false teaching.
