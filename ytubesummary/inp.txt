i want to introduce to you the moderator.of tonight's event he's not only one of.america's most influential men in the.news business but he has chosen to use.his talents to use his gift of writing.and his organization influence for the.kingdom please give a warm welcome and a.round of applause for my good friend.this founder and ceo of worldnetdaily.the largest independent news.organization in the world joseph farah.thank you thank you.your words are too kind jim.you know there are more than 2 billion.people in the world who call themselves.christians.and.almost all of them would express some.kind of reverence for.the 10 commandments.although you know an increasing number.of them especially here in the united.states say that.as new creations in christ they're no.longer capable of committing sin so they.could they shouldn't even have to worry.about what the ten commandments are.about but most believers ign at least.acknowledge.that they're god's commandments.good guidelines for for living and most.would say they try to live by them most.would acknowledge when they fall short.they need repentance.but what about the fourth commandment.what about the sabbath.do they observe the sabbath as defined.in the bible do they keep the seventh.day holy.or should they.and if so.why do so few of.the more than 2 billion believers in the.world actually do so this is the topic.of a very unusual debate today here at.passion for truth ministries in saint.charles missouri with two very.passionate pastors and teachers jim.staley and chris rosebro.before i introduced them formally.tonight let me introduce myself my name.is joseph farah of wnd.com.formerly known as.worldnetdaily.com the first independent.news agency created for the internet.some 17.years ago that's a long time 17 years in.internet years is like a thousand.i'm a lifelong journalist and a follower.of jesus yeshua wnd.com also happens to.be the largest.christian website in the world.uh though our mission is primarily to.bring the christian worldview.into the reporting of the news so i will.serve as the moderator of this debate.tonight.though when it comes time to being.a believer in jesus i am no moderate.in fact i'm not really much of a.moderate at anything.but i am all in for jesus yeshua and.what that means for me as i suspect it.does for all of you here tonight and all.of those watching online is this.question what does yeshua mean when he.tells us in john 14 15.if you love me keep my commandments.i came all the way from washington d.c.for this debate tonight because it's.actually quite a historic event.you know you all know how you can find.anything on youtube right.just try to find a debate like this on.youtube.you won't find it.you'll find debates on every imaginable.topic you can think of but not on the.sabbath so this is history.in the making the topic tonight.should christians keep the sabbath.so let's meet our debaters.chris rosebro.is an apologist and pastor he's a.regular guest on the radio program radio.program.issues etc right here in.k-f-u-o in st louis he's lectured at.several conferences in the u.s and has.been featured.with prominent christian authors such

got a degree in religious.studies and biblical languages and i.just met chris today for the first time.though we have corresponded in the past.and i can tell you he's a very smart and.very prepared

christian.apologist right here in the st louis.area teaching bible study classes and.equipping.christians to better defend their faith.and to evangelize but since 2001.he has dedicated his life to helping.believers further understand the.christian roots of their faith by diving.into the original cultural context.language and idiomatic expressions of.the bible and how to apply them.to their faith today.now let's talk about the ground rules.and format for this lively friendly.brotherly respectful showdown each.debater.each debater will be allowed an opening.statement of 20 minutes.on the topic.and those opening statements will be.followed by 10 minutes.of rebuttal time followed by two more.seven minute rebuttals then we move on.to two 10-minute cross-examination.periods and finally two closing.statements of just five minutes each.so.buckle your seat belts settle down for.what we anticipate to be history in the.making a very provocative and.informative two-hour debate like

thank.all of you for coming today to witness.this historic event on such a very.important subject and i need the.monitors turned down please i also want.to thank my opponent chris rosebro.for accepting the invitation to engage.on this topic as well as joseph farah.for taking time out of his busy schedule.to fly all the way out here from.washington dc.and and be here to moderate this debate.first of all i want to mention that this.is not a salvific issue this is not a.salvation issue.this is about.whether we should or should not uh god.doesn't make us do anything uh matter of.fact uh we don't have to do anything but.he encourages us to and so this debate.is really gonna focus around whether we.should or whether we shouldn't and it's.very important uh as we're going to find.out this evening.first of all i want to show and give an.overview of history.uh from creation to today to show that.god's original intent.it's very important that we understand.god's original intent and whether or not.his original intent was for us to keep.the sabbath on hebrew the shabbat.for all eternity so we're going to turn.to genesis chapter 2 verse 2 and it says.on the seventh day god ended his work.which he had made and he rested on the.seventh day from all his work which he.had made and god blessed the seventh day.and he's sanctified it that hebrew word.there is kadosh it's made it's to be set.apart it's to be made holy as a matter.of fact it's the very thing that we're.commanded to do is to be set apart and.to be made holy.and so he says because that he had.rested from all the work which god had.made i want to turn to mark chapter 2.verse 27 we're going to go through a lot.of scriptures here only got 20 minutes.to get a four hour uh message in here.but mark 2 27 says and he said to them.the sabbath was made for man and not man.for the sabbath therefore the son of man.is also lord of the sabbath so here's.the question there are a lot of people.that would say that the sabbath was not.given to anybody but israel.but un unfortunately the scriptures tell.us otherwise that it says right here.jesus himself says the sabbath was made.for man when was it made i contend it.was made in creation this was before man.ever sinned the intention of god if man.what is in sin let me leave this and.posit this question to everyone here.tonight if man had not sinned.we would not be having this debate.we would be keeping the shabbat on the.seventh day exactly the way that he.hollowed it exactly the way that he.created it the exactly the way that he.commanded it.and so it says in genesis chapter 1.verse 14 it says then god said let there.be lights in the firmament of the.heavens to divide the day from the night.and let them be for signs and seasons.and for days and for years and i want to.show you in the powerpoint tonight that.the word season's there is not spring.summer winter fall.it's very deceiving in the english in.the hebrew it's actually moedim.and in the strong's 3259 i was going to.read it to you it says this properly an.appointment a fixed time or season.specifically a festival.by implication it's an assembly a.congregation convened for a definite.purpose technically the congregation by.extension the place of meeting talking.about the tabernacle also a signal in.the sky appointed it's a sign a place of.solemn assembly congregation a feast.appointed due season do you see you.catch this do you see what the the the.strong definition the hebrew is saying.that god actually from the very.beginning of creation he did never had.the intention that all days were the.same he put sun moon and stars in the.sky for one purpose.to set the times and the seasons of his.anniversaries of when he wanted to meet.with his people.and so from the very beginning the.sabbath the the festivals the feast days.the very congregation holy convocation.of god were set apart not for us to.decide on our own.he's the maker and the creator of the.universe and he put the stars in the sky.so that he could have those times and.appointments and we wouldn't miss them.so much so that the messiah was born.under a sign the signs of his second.coming you say are all dependent on the.stars.so if the debate in the argument is.going to be that we can choose the day.that we are obliterating the purpose and.the point of god of creating the stars.in the sun and the moon in the sky for.those such appointments.also an argument can be made that the.sabbath is not even found in the in the.book of genesis or that the commandments.itself were given on mount sinai suggest.that yes they were given on mount sinai.they were written down like children who.won't obey the first time god said don't.let me come down there i'm going to.write it down and we see the.commandments all over the place maybe on.that detail but we see them cain and.abel bringing sacrifices before the.sacrificial system was given.we see in genesis 26 5 abraham obeyed my.voice and says it kept my charge my.commandments my statues and my laws and.the hebrew word for law there is torah.before the torah was given there was a.relationship it was written on the heart.there was obviously something that.happened in genesis chapter seven we all.know the noah's story that he took two.by two no he didn't he took two by two.of the unclean animals but it says in.verse two you shall take with you seven.each of the clean animals so clearly.before leviticus chapter 11 are the.clean and unclean laws were given in the.torah that god already gave these laws.in the garden and that's why noah.already knew about these laws.we see in exodus chapter 16 the sabbath.was given before mount sinai.how do we know that because in exodus 16.he commands his people to not go out to.pick up the manna on the shabbat he says.go out and pick up twice as much but you.better rest on the next day and ladies.and gentlemen that's before mount sinai.let's take like take a look at isaiah 56.verse 6 and we'll discover that the.gentiles themselves are encouraged to.keep the shabbat.it says also the sons of the stranger.that were there's is going the gentiles.that join themselves to the lord to.serve him to love the name of the lord.to be his servants everyone that keeps.the sabbath from polluting it and taking.hold of my covenant even them i will.bring to my holy mountain and make them.joyful in my house of prayer and this.finishes with one of the most powerful.verses that we all know it says this.their burnt offerings and their.sacrifices shall be accepted upon my.altar for my house shall be called a.house of prayer for all nations.but the entry to the house of all.nations.was they must keep the shabbat.some say the sabbath cannot be found in.the new testament.we find it all over the place in the new.testament matter of fact one of the most.powerful arguments the sabbath is.everywhere is this.if i give ten commandments to my.children and they keep nine of them.but they don't keep one which one am i.going to talk about.the one that they didn't keep and i.suggest that the seventh day sabbath.does not have to be reiterated in detail.because it's jerusalem they're all.jewish people and everyone's keeping the.shabbat there's no reason to to chastise.them for that but it says this in.matthew 5 17 do not think that i came to.destroy the law or prophets i did not.come to destroy but to fulfill.assuredly i say to you till heaven earth.pass away not one jot or tittle will.pass away from the law till everything.is fulfilled whoever listen we don't.quote this verse whoever therefore.breaks one of the least of these.commandments and teaches men also shall.be called least in the kingdom of heaven.but whoever doesn't teach them he shall.be called great in the kingdom of heaven.ladies and gentlemen revelation 21 tells.us exactly when the sabbath is done away.with.because the the inference is when heaven.and earth pass away it says the first.heaven and the earth will pass away.after the millennium.and there'll be no more death no more.crying no more pain as far as i know we.still have all the above and a single.jot or tittle will pass away.i also suggest that the sabbath is not.the least of the commandments.it is one of the top five one of the.greatest.and so if he says you'll be least in in.the kingdom for teaching the breaking.the least how much more for breaking the.greatest.the sabbath is included in a generic.over umbrella of the commandments itself.paul says in romans 3 31 do we nullify.the torah by this faith the faith of.jesus not at all rather we uphold the.law the law undoubtedly included the.sabbath for paul to say he upholds the.law of god but to not uphold the sabbath.they would have stoned him immediately.for that it was understood first john 5.2 one of my favorite verses says by this.we know that we love the children of god.when we love god and we keep his.commandments for this is the love of god.that we keep his commandments and his.commandments are not burdensome ladies.and gentlemen let me point out the.obvious the new testament has not been.written yet it didn't exist.john one of the most jewish apostles the.only thing he could have been talking.about is what's called the tanakh what.we call the old testament the torah the.commandments of god would certainly.include.the fourth.revelation chapter 14 says here is the.patience of the saints in verse 12 here.are they that keep the commandments of.god and hold to the testimony of yeshua.jesus.in the rev in the in the tribulation we.see that god's people are defined by two.things not just believing in jesus but.that you prove your love for god like.first john says by keeping his.commandments so we have this interesting.paradox or this connection of a a a.dichotomy that fits together in a.beautiful picture of keeping proving out.your love for god just like we prove out.our love for one another what would a.marriage be like if a husband didn't.actually prove his love by doing things.for the wife.in the millennium we even see this if.it's not enough from genesis to.revelation in the millennium we see the.sabbath isaiah 66 22 says for as the new.heavens and the new earth which i will.make shall remain before me says yahweh.so shall your seed and your name remain.and it shall come to pass that from one.new moon to another.and from one sabbath to another.shall all flesh doesn't say all jewish.people says all flesh shall come to.worship me before the lord says yahweh.so i beg to differ that maybe i could be.wrong in this lifetime but in the.millennium ladies and gentlemen we will.be keeping the sabbath and it makes a.difference so much so that there are.punishments indicted to mankind for not.doing so.and take a look at zechariah 14 verse 6.when it says that not only the sabbath.but we'll be keeping the feast of.tabernacles and rain will be cut off.from those parts of the world that do.not.so so far the sabbath was given to man.in the garden on the seventh day and was.intended for eternity.man forgot the sabbath got caught up in.egypt for 400 years didn't even remember.his god had to reintroduce him to moses.so he introduces himself to his people.once again and this time writes it down.so they don't forget.jesus kept the sabbath as well as all.the apostolic christians.the sabbath is instituted in the.millennium as well as the feast days.it was only after the destruction of the.temple the influx of gentiles in the.18th benediction that cursed christians.in the synagogues.that the gentile christians began to be.detached from the roots of their faith.and to begin embrace a mixture of.paganism and biblical truth together.as a matter of fact it was not god.the messiah or the disciples that.changed the sabbath but was man's idea.and anti-semitism that changed the.sabbath from its biblical.root.as time went on the early church marched.further and further from its root while.church officials followed right in the.footsteps of the pharisees trading the.commandments of god for the traditions.of men.even making the very thing that god says.is eternal.bondage and labeling it is something.that is heretical.in 135 hadrian.after the barkova.revolt outlawed the study of torah the.circumcision and observance of the.sabbath putting huge pressure on the.christians of the day.to distance themselves from their jewish.brethren's for the sake of survival.settling the debate about which day that.would be the sabbath finally in 321 a.d.the roman emperor constantine said this.on the venerable day of the sun.let the magistrate and the people.residing in the city's rest and all the.workshops be closed from that day on.there was no way that you were going to.go against the church because the church.and the state were one in those days and.if you did you were going to find.yourself if not excommunicated you could.die and many thousands died for just.keeping the shabbat this issue was not.just a black and white issue taken care.of at the cross we see this debate.raging on for all the way through the.centuries all the way through martin.luther and even today the only.difference with the debate today is that.either neither one of us will kill each.other if we're wrong.but in the days before the west.i hope not.in a.d 325 pulp syrvester officially.named sunday get this the lord's day and.in 838 just three years later eusebius.the court bishop of constatine wrote.this all things whatsoever that was the.duty to do on the sabbath.we have now transferred to the lord's.day the first day of the week as more.appropriately belonging to it.and if we move forward into the converts.catechism of catholic catholic doctrines.we see this for converts a question and.answer which is the sabbath day.they say saturday is the sabbath day.why do we observe sunday instead of.saturday the catholic church answers and.says we observe sunday instead of.saturday because the catholic church and.the council of legacy in 336 a.d.transferred the solemnity of from.saturday to sunday.why did the catholic church substitute.sunday for saturday the church.substituted sunday for saturday because.christ rose from the dead on a sunday.and the holy ghost descended upon the.apostles on a sunday of course today.with modern archaeology and historical.documents we know that it didn't happen.on a sunday.by what authority did the church.substitute sunday for saturday and get.this.the church substituted sunday for.saturday by the plentitude of that.divine power which jesus christ bestowed.upon her.there are bishops that will even say.that those that keep sunday sabbath are.under the jurisdiction of the roman.catholic church history proves ladies.and gentlemen the sabbath was everywhere.for multiple centuries.we have socrates scholasticus in the 5th.century saying this for although almost.all churches throughout the world.celebrate the sacred mysteries of the.lord's supper on the shabbat on the.sabbath every week yet the christians of.alexandria and rome on account of some.ancient tradition pagan sun god worship.have ceased to do this.fifth century.another historian confirmed this by.stating the people of constantinople and.almost everywhere assembled together on.the sabbath as well as on the first day.of the week which custom is never.observed in rome and alexandria ladies.and gentlemen let me propose a question.that should sit in your soul this.evening who ended up ruling the world.rome.and whoever rules makes the rules.today my contentions are as follows.the sabbath number one was given in the.beginning of time and is made clear that.god's original intention was for all man.and for all time.my opponent will have to prove that the.sabbath was never intended to be kept in.the garden or in the millennium and was.not given to man as a blessing for rest.number two historical accounts prove.that the biblical sabbath was changed.without scriptural authority and this.change was never given by god yeshua or.his disciples but rather happened over.time as gentile christians became.divorced from their christian roots.there was an identity crisis amongst.gentile believers.after they were kicked out of the.synagogues.they naturally created their own brand.of interpretations of scripture that.would distance themselves from their.jewish brothers remember 99 percent of.all the church fathers were pagan.polytheistic gentile backgrounds.trying to understand a jewish bible.written by jews in a jewish culture.using the hebrew language with.anti-semitism it's a it's a formula for.a disaster from the very beginning.my opponent will have to show where in.the scriptures that is prophesied that.the very seal of god's people it says.and a top five commandment would.actually change.after all in amos 3 7 surely the lord.god does nothing.except he reveals it to his prophets.first.furthermore he'll have to explain while.if the intent of christ was to abolish.the sabbath the very gift and seal of.god to his people and the disciples knew.about this.and taught this why is there not a.single straightforward passage in the.entire bible.stating this change and why ladies and.gentlemen where is the debate this is.the largest single change in the history.of the bible prophecy and there's not a.single dialogue about it inside or.outside of biblical scriptures.where is the debate why aren't the jews.in a massive uproar they killed 11 out.of the 12 disciples my friends and.there's not a single charge against them.for keeping the sabbath or not keeping.the sabbath.if they were.teaching their converts to break the.shabbat or saying that every day is the.same they would have pulled them right.into the sanhedrin according to the oral.and in the law of the jews and they.would have stoned them or killed them on.the spot they tried that even with paul.if you recall what does he say.he says that they accused me of teaching.against the law of god and what happens.he goes in and he's encouraged by the.nazi james to take a nazarite vow.and he does so to prove.that he's not teaching against the law.of god of which the sabbath is a part.lastly my opponent will have to explain.how something that is traditionally.called bondage and christianity has been.such a blessing for countless thousands.of christians everywhere.if keeping the sabbath on the day the.bible says is bondage then how are so.many people being healed relationships.marriages and families being restored.all they say as a result of beginning to.keep the sabbath.could it actually be true that god meant.what he said on mount sinai when he said.i set before you blessings and curses.blessings if you keep my commandments.was god trying to put his people in.bondage ladies and gentlemen in the.garden.god told man not to eat of the tree of.knowledge of good and evil.the serpent came along and whispered.into their ears.god didn't really mean what he said.he knows that if you eat of it that.you'll be more like him.your eyes will be open and you'll be.able to worship him better.i suggest to you today that this.strategy is exactly what he's done with.the sabbath.he didn't really mean what he said.open your eyes and see that sunday is.much better day to celebrate the sabbath.after all god doesn't really care about.which day anyway.i believe the enemy has stolen huge.blessings from god's people.because we keep falling into these.deceptive traps.i believe that the burden of proof lies.with my opponent to prove that god did.not mean what he said.and to explain to all of us how what he.calls a blessing has now become a burden.and a curse.my friends from the very beginning of.this debate.that started certainly when the gentiles.of the 18th benediction where the jewish.people and the christians were meeting.on shabbat together as history proves.but eventually the christians grew in.number and became irritating to the.non-believing jews and so as they said.the 17 prayers they added in 18th.and in that 18th prayer it put a curse.on all of the christians and so they.couldn't say the 18th benediction which.means that they were called a heretic.and expelled from the synagogues and.that was the beginning of the.anti-semitism in the church.ladies and gentlemen we've come to the.same place where we have fallen for the.same tactics the enemy has given and i.suggest that we go back to the beginning.of the restoration of all things and.grab hold of the blessings that we don't.even know.we're missing.thank you.and now.chris roseborough.will present his uh 20-minute opening.statement.first of all i'd like to thank passion.for the truth for hosting today's debate.and i'd like to thank jim staley for.providing us with a succinct summary of.his position for laying out the.explanation of his theological approach.my remarks will be directed to this.position.so how do we answer this question are we.supposed to keep the sabbath or not as.christians well.this question cannot be answered by.merely looking at the biblical passages.that reference the sabbath.the commandment.remember the sabbath day to keep it holy.does not stand alone.but.it is part of an inseparable network of.commandments given by yahweh this is.often called the torah or the mosaic.covenant therefore this christian.question cannot be answered by looking.at what scripture teaches solely.regarding the relationship of christians.who are under a new covenant to the.mosaic covenant.okay so my methodology tonight will do.this i'm going to demonstrate that.sabbatarians in both the hebrew roots.movement and in the seventh-day.adventism and i understand that jim.staley is technically not in the hebrew.roots movement although he has a similar.position that they do not rightly.understand the relationship of.christians to the mosaic covenant and.this is due to a faulty hermeneutic by.the way i'll explain that in a second in.two key passages exodus chapter 31 verse.16 and matthew chapter 5 verses 16.through 18 which jim just referenced.once we rightly understand those.passages we'll be able to look at what.the rest of the new testament says.regarding the torah's function in our.relationship to it as christians and.finally i will demonstrate that the.early church fathers rightly understood.this relationship and this fact only.provides us with the explanation as to.why they worship on the lord's day.sunday rather than the sabbath now.before we get started a quick word about.hermeneutics i understand that that's a.fancy theological term and if you're a.seminary student i recommend using that.term at parties where girls are at it'll.get you a date.i tried it once i'm married now.okay.but basically hermeneutics is the study.and discipline of biblical.interpretation and one of the features.of hermeneutics is an understanding of.correct reference you'll hear me use.that term a few times tonight and to.kind of demonstrate the importance of a.proper reference in fact what is a text.referring to if you misunderstand a.reference you can get yourself in a lot.of trouble so i have a story to tell you.about mr and mrs snodgrass now mrs.snodgrass is a person not unlike many of.us she hates to be stuck in traffic and.for the past few months she has spent.her days.dreaming about owning a bright new red.sports car she even on several occasions.recently was seen at several car.dealerships test driving the newest.muscle cars and dreaming of the day that.she could zip effortlessly through.traffic.and.go around cars and things like that in.her bright new red shiny driving machine.now being that her birthday was quickly.approaching.she began dropping hints about what she.wanted for her birthday to mr snodgrass.and when he finally asked her what she.wanted for her birthday she didn't want.to be too direct.so she said honey.i've been dreaming of owning something.that can go from zero to 200 in less.than four seconds.now mrs snodgrass's birthday arrived and.she was filled with the type of.excitement that a five-year-old feels on.christmas morning although you guys.don't celebrate that here do you but.when she opened mr snodgrass's present.rather than find the keys to a brand new.shiny red muscle car.she found a bathroom scale.funeral services for mr snodgrass will.be held this tuesday.all right the point of that story is to.demonstrate the importance of.understanding reference although a.bathroom scale does go from zero to 200.in less than four seconds.that was not the referent that mrs.snodgrass was referring to when she told.mr snodgrass what she wanted for her.birthday so properly understanding.reference can not only save your life in.the case of mr snodgrass it can also.help you properly understand god's word.so let's take a look at exodus chapter.31 verse 16 and notice i'm not.projecting today so you get to follow.along therefore the people of israel.shall keep the sabbath day observing the.sabbath throughout their generations as.a covenant.forever.now notice i should put some echo on.that forever ever ever ever ever now at.first glance this seems pretty cut and.dry it seems to be saying that the.sabbath will be observed for eternity.after all isn't that what the words.covenant forever mean.well answer no when you pay closer.attention to the texts referent you will.discover that it is not saying that the.sabbath will be observed for eternity.now in order to demonstrate why this is.the case we're going to look at a couple.of cross-references in the book of.exodus that use this exact type of.language exodus chapter 21 verses 2.through 6 reads this.when you buy a hebrew slave he shall.serve six years and in the seventh he.shall go out free for nothing if he.comes in single he shall go out single.if he comes in married then his wife.shall go out with him if his master.gives him a wife and she bears him sons.and daughters and the wife and her.children shall be her masters and he.shall go out alone but if this if the.slave plainly says i love my master my.wife and my children i will not go out.free then his master shall bring him to.god and he shall bring him to the door.or the doorpost and his master shall.bore his ear through and all and he.shall be his slave.forever.forever forever forever.question is yahweh actually revealing.that someone will be another person's.slave.for eternity.well before we answer that let's look at.another passage exodus chapter 27 verses.20 and 21 says this you shall command.the people of israel that they bring to.you pure beaten olive oil for the light.that a lamp may regularly be set up to.burn in the tent of meaning outside the.veil that is before the testimony aaron.and his sons shall tend it from evening.to morning before the lord and it shall.be a statute.forever.to be observed through all their.generations by the people of israel.well where is this lamp today it doesn't.exist god's word says that this will be.a statute forever.god does god's word contradict itself.how can this be a statute forever if.there is no way to observe this statute.well the answer is simple the hebrew.word in play in all three of these texts.is the hebrew word alam and the question.we need to answer is whether or not the.referent in exodus 31 16 our original.text is eternity.or something else.now when you do your semantic research.you will find that olam.does not always mean eternity but.oftentimes is referring only to a.duration of time as h m riggle correctly.noted in his book from the lord's day.from the sabbath to the lord's day he.said this.forever speaking of spiritual things and.future destinies etc means unending it.is also used in speaking of laws to.indicate that they are in continuous.force.standing permanent in such case it.indicates a law is unchangeable and.unrepealable while the system of which.it is apart.lasts as old testament scholar harold.dressler noted the sabbath is not viewed.as a universal ordinance for all of.mankind instead it is a specific.institution for israel as a sign of the.covenant it was to last.only as long as that covenant not.forever.next passage matthew chapter 5 verses 17.through 18 do not think that i have come.to abolish the law jesus is speaking.here or the prophets i have not come to.abolish them but to fulfill them for.truly i say to you until heaven and.earth pass away not an iota not a dot.will pass from the law until all.is accomplished now sabbatarians of all.stripes misread this text and believe.that the referent of the clause until.heaven and earth pass away means that.the mosaic law is in is going to be in.effect until.heaven and earth pass away or until.or the millennium.this is a misreading of the text which.can easily be cleared up by reading some.good scholarly commentaries as well as.some employing some good hermeneutical.principles namely that principle that.scripture interprets scripture and that.clear passages always govern unclear.passages and never the other way around.now if this passage we're saying that.the mosaic law is in effect until heaven.and earth pass away then the bible.contradicts itself and here's why.hebrews 10 1 says this the law has but a.shadow of the good things to come.instead of the true form of these.realities hebrews 10 9 says this he does.away with the first covenant in order to.establish the second notice it says he.does away with it.hebrews 7 11-12 now if perfection had.been obtainable through the levitical.priesthood for under it the people.received the law what further need would.there have been for another priest to.arise after the order of melchizedek.rather than one named after the order of.aaron for when there is a change in the.priesthood there is necessarily a change.in the law as well.romans 10 4 for christ is the end of the.law for right for righteousness to.everyone who believes galatians 3 19.will why then the law it was added.because of transgressions until the.offspring should come to whom the.promise has been made and galatians 3.23-26 now before faith came we were held.captive under the law imprisoned until.the coming faith would be revealed so.then the law was our guardian until.christ came in order that we might be.justified by faith but now that faith.has come we are no longer under a garden.guardian in other words we're no longer.under the law for in christ jesus you.are all sons of god through faith romans.6 14 for sin will have no dominion over.you since you are not under the law but.you are under grace.all of these clear passages that.christians are not under the law and.that the the book of hebrews makes.crystal clear that the law was but a.shadow of good things to come instead of.the true form of these realities.therefore the referent.of the phrase until heaven and earth.pass away is not the idea that the law.will be in effect until the end of the.world instead if you do your homework.you'll discover that scholars like rt.france john p meyer robert j banks they.all note that the phrase until heaven.and earth pass away.is an idiomatic statement.it's similar to our statement until hell.freezes over the basic meaning of this.idiom is that well that will never.happen and when you understand this fact.then you can rightly understand that the.referent that this text is pointing to.namely it is not saying that the law.will be in effect until the end of the.world instead but that none of it will.ever disappear until it is fulfilled in.fact the greek phrase in this sentence.there's two until clauses and the second.one governs everything else in it until.all is fulfilled or as riggle states.quote that is the idea not the length of.time the law was to continue but the.certainty that it would not fail to be.fulfilled and that is exactly what jesus.did he fulfilled the law just like he.said he would that is why we are no.longer under the law and that includes.the requirements to keep the sabbath.hebrews chapter 8 verses 6 through 7.says this but as it is christ has.obtained a ministry that is much more.excellent than the old.than the old as the covenant that he.mediates is better since it is enacted.on better promises for if that first.covenant had been faultless there would.have been no occasion for uh to look for.a second in speaking of a new covenant.he makes the first one.obsolete.mosaic covenant according to hebrews.8 has been made obsolete by christ and.what is becoming obsolete is growing old.and is already ready to vanish away.ephesians chapter 2 verses 14 through 15.states for he himself is our peace who.has made us both one and has broken down.in his flesh the dividing wall of.hostility.by.abolishing.the law.of commandments.expressed in ordinances.ephesians 2 14 makes it clear 14-15.the law and its ordinances and its.commandments against us have been.abolished so christians are not.obligated.to keep the mosaic covenant under the.new covenant christians are not.obligated to observe the passover.circumcise their male children keep a.kosher diet appear before yahweh three.times a year in the city of jerusalem.which by the way torah expressly says.you must do.celebrate the new moons of the sabbaths.those were all types and shadows and now.that christ has come the shadows have.given way to their rightful substance.the late walter martin tells a great.story about a man who would go away on.business trips and he had gone away on a.particularly long business trip and when.he was gone his wife says i miss you so.much i miss you i wish you were here and.so it was a bright sunny day the plane.came back it was one of those types of.planes where when you get off the plane.you come down the ramp and the stairs.and you go on the tarmac and as soon as.his wife saw him on the tarmac she runs.to give him a hug and then seeing his.shadow.he she falls on the ground and starts.kissing his shadow.that's ridiculous though right.of course it is.because the law according to the new.testament is shadow.jesus is the substance.colossians 2 13-17 therefore let no one.pass judgment on you in questions of.food and drink or with regard to a.festival or a new moon or a sabbath.these are the shadow of things to come.but the substance belongs to christ.notice in colossians chapter 2.it expressly says paul expressly says.not to let anyone judge you regarding a.sabbath because.they.are shadow christ is the substance.right.i've got to watch my time here.now let me do a little bit of a survey.and in my rebuttal time i'm going to.actually spend a little bit of time.demonstrating from the writings of the.church fathers.that it was christians way early first.early second century who were already.observing the lord's day not the sabbath.the idea that constantine is responsible.for this plays well if you're into da.vinci code type conspiracies but.actually doesn't stand up to scrutiny.when you actually read the church.fathers but i want to take a look at.what scripture says regarding the eighth.day the eighth day is the day when jesus.rose from the dead it's the beginning of.a new creation christ is the first.fruits of a new creation his.resurrection marks the beginning of.something completely radically new and.so we read in luke chapter 24 that on.the eighth day they rose that same hour.and returned to jerusalem and they found.the eleven and those who were with them.gathered together saying the lord has.risen indeed and has appeared to simon.now this was the first day of the week.which christ rose in john chapter 20 we.find out on that first day of the week.on the evening of that day the first day.of the week the doors being locked where.the deci where the disciples were for.fear of the jews jesus came and stood.among them and said to them peace be.with you remember thomas missed that.meeting and so the next one week later.on.sunday the first day of the week it says.his disciples were inside again and.thomas was with with them although the.doors were locked jesus came and stood.among them and said peace be with you.then he said to thomas put your finger.here see my hands and put your hand and.place it in my side do not disbelieve.but believe see already.the disciples were in the habit of.meeting.on the first day and who shows up on the.first day jesus himself who showed up on.the first day also well the holy spirit.himself in leviticus chapter 23 verses.15 through 16 we read this you shall.count seven full weeks from the day.after the sabbath from the day that you.brought the sheaf of the wave offering.and you shall count 50 days to the day.after the seventh sabbath and then you.shall present grain offering a new grain.to the lord this is regarding the feast.of pentecost and so.we learn in acts chapter 2 on the day.after the sabbath the first day of the.week.it was the holy spirit who arrived and.what were the apostles doing they were.already gathered together acts chapter.20 verse 27 says this the apostle paul.talking you know talking about the.apostle paul's journey to troas he says.on the first day of the week when we.were gathered together to break.bread paul talked with them intending to.depart on the next day and he prolonged.his speech until midnight when did the.church meet according to acts 20 verse 7.they met on the first day of the week.first corinthians chapter 16 verses 1.through 2 now concerning the collection.the saints as i directed the churches of.galatia so also you are also to do on.the first day of every week each of you.is to put something aside and store it.up that he may prosper so that there.will be no collecting when i come in.revelation 1 10 i was in the spirit on.the lord's day and i heard behind me a.loud voice like a trumpet over and again.when we read in scriptures about.what the church was doing they were.meeting.to commemorate.jesus's resurrection from the dead and.there was not a single commandment in.the new testament regarding keeping the.sabbath and the reason for this is.because all the clear passages make it.clear.that the torah and its ordinances and.its feasts and new moons and sabbath.were all.canceled the old covenant has passed the.new has come the type and shadow have.given way to the substance and the.substance is christ.so as i've demonstrated sabbatarians.including those in the hebrew roots.movement misread exodus 31 verse 16 and.matthew 5 16-18 and now that we.understand that we understand the.passages that show that we are under the.new covenant and that we are no longer.under torah and its ordinances and its.sabbaths and its new moons and its.feasts now when i come back i'll spend a.little bit of time in the church fathers.to demonstrate that it wasn't the fourth.century when things changed it was the.first century and already.the new the church fathers by the second.century were observing the lord's day.the first day not the sabbath.and now we will move into the first.rebuttal period with jim staley.presenting his 10-minute rebuttal.i can see that chris's strategy is to.bog me down by chasing him through all.these scriptures.it's a great strategy i don't know where.to start there's so many.i will concede right off the bat that.the christians early christians were.meeting on the first day of the week.history tells us and we even know the.evolution of how it happened but because.they were meeting on the first day of.the week ladies and gentlemen there's.other pets they're meeting every day.and so they were meeting.every time they got together they were.to remember uh the lord's supper and to.uh and to convene and remember the death.burial resurrection of the messiah but.meeting on the first day does not.obliterate a commandment no more.than then.by the way let me just bring this up if.my opponent is correct.and the law has been done away with and.if we want to make this debate over that.issue and i understand it's an ancillary.part of it that's absolutely fine but.the mistake that he is making is that.the ten commandments are connected to.the law of god.matter of fact so much so.that if my opponent is correct and the.law of god is completely obliterated and.done away with.ladies and gentlemen we can commit.adultery.we can murder we can do anything we want.because there's no law matter of fact i.would point my opponent to 1st john.chapter 3 verse 4.that says that the definition of sin is.this.sin is the transgression of god's law so.if my opponent is correct and the law of.god has done away with then we don't.have a single other definition of sin in.the entire bible then we've got a.theological nightmare on our hands.because uh the baptist organization.alone over the last 50 years has spent 2.billion dollars on missions to tell.people about jesus around the world.which is a lofty and amazing goal that i.fully support but why are we telling.anybody about jesus if the law of god.has done away with because the.definition of sin is breaking the law of.god and so if the law of god's done away.with there's no definition of sin.there's no reason to tell them that they.need jesus for for what for breaking.something that doesn't exist.we should save our money in that case i.would suggest that we're reading the.scriptures wrong we don't understand.the definition of god's law in the first.century in the idiomatic expressions and.the oral law and everything puts.together in the way that it is and.here's why.when he says under the law we're no.longer under the law i'll cut to the.chase and let you know that it's not an.american english the way we read that as.we're no longer under the law.meaning that we don't have to keep it.in english today it's the exact it's a.legal expression that means exactly the.way it means today.the constitution of the united states.ladies and gentlemen is not done away.with.if we are not un if we are under the law.that means you broke it you're under it.you're under the penalty of the law it's.an idiomatic expression in hebrew first.century culture that was very obvious.that you're not under the penalty of the.law god came not to remove what he.called his word which ended up being.made flesh.he came to remove the penalty.and in colossians chapter 2 when my.opponent begins to tell you that what.was nailed to the cross was the.ordinances it is not the ordinances of.god's law my friends that were nailed to.the cross we have paul very.schizophrenic who says he upholds those.very same ordinances.that my opponent says is nailed to the.cross.what was nailed to the cross in the.first century was there was ordinances.in the aramaic makes it very clear it.says the the bonds.and the written ordinances of our sin.meaning that on judgment day what you.are held accountable to there are two.books the book of life and the book of.works.and so if your name is not found in the.book of.life.everything that you do is found in a.book with ordinances.handwritings that are written against.you.if you get a ticket for speeding.and i want to come in and i want to i.want to free you from that do i go to.the united states supreme court and ask.them to obliterate the law of all stop.signs and speed limits.or do i simply pay your ticket.and remove the ordinances that stood.against you so let's begin there's so.many places to go.the first day of the week first.corinthians chapter 16 verse 1 and 2 we.can look at that.first of all it does not say that they.met on sunday in this verse only that.they were to set an offering aside he.says on the first of the week which by.the way there is argument uh chris that.the first of the week in hebrew could.actually possibly mean one of the.sabbaths now i don't subject to that i.actually believe that it means one of.sabbath which is how they counted in the.first century the first day till sabbath.the second day till sabbath because.everything was about the sabbath so by.the mere fact that they even chose the.greek phrase mia sabaton proves the fact.that they were counting the entire.counting system in the first century.revolved around the sabbath because it.does not say on sunday it does not even.say the first day of the week it says.one of shabbat and every historical uh.commentator.that knows the original language in its.context knows that that's how they count.it was one of the shabbat two of the.shabbat and so they met on the first of.the shabbat but it does not say.that they met on this verse it only said.that they were to set aside an offering.on this and what's even more interesting.is the greek phrase.lay by him in store.every commentator that i could find.of a greek.academia says this.that it means store it up.at home.there was no bringing it to church.there was no church ladies and gentlemen.in the first century it was the.synagogues and the synagogues were.closed.on sunday it was the romans that kept.their sabbath on the sunday the.venerable day.of the sun.he also mentions romans chapter 14 verse.4 and 5. let's read it in its entire.context.it says who are you to judge another.servant to his own master he stands or.falls indeed he will be made to stand.for god is able to make him stand one.person esteems one day another.another steams every day alike let each.be fully convinced in his own mind.ladies and gentlemen we are led to.believe that on the shabbat.that that there was there was not even a.debate in the first century when the.seventh day is and we're led to believe.that there is a debate a heavy debate in.the first century on which day the.sabbath was if we read this context.carefully we understand the culture and.what the debates were the debate is over.fasting this day was over they fasted.two times a week pharisees did it on one.day.the other uh the sadducees did it on a.different day this is a huge debate on.which camp you're gonna come into and.the context gives it away in verse one.it says receive who one is weak in the.faith but but do not dispute over.doubtful things for one believes he may.eat all things and the very next verse.after verse six says he who observes the.day observes it to the lord and he who.does not observe the day to the lord he.does not observe it he who eats eats.unto the lord and he who gives god.thanks for he does not eat the whole.context is about food but we are led to.believe by uh commentators that this is.about the sabbath this is not about the.sabbath it is simply about.food.running out of a time here so let me go.back to all the things that he had.mentioned pentecost was not on sunday.ladies and gentlemen the history records.tell us otherwise uh we go back to this.we go back to the writings of josephus.the first century jewish historian says.but on the second day of unleavened.bread.which is the 16th of the month so you.have to know about the first century.feast days is that the 14th is when the.passover meal was the very next day was.the 15th okay the 15th is the first day.of unleavened bread which is a high.shabbat on the hebrew calendar the 16th.is the day that they started counting.for the feast of shavuot or in greek.pentecost if you count 50 days from the.16th it is not on a sunday it can be on.any day it is only the christian church.uh mainly in some sects of of uh in.messianic circles that believe that the.shavuot or the feast of pentecost was on.sunday even in the aramaic versions of.targum ankylos on leviticus 23 15 the.very.scriptures that are used to tell us when.that happens says and count to you after.the festival day from the day you.brought the omer of the elevation seven.weeks after the festival day which one.not on shabbat it's after the high.shabbat so the mistake that christians.make not understanding the culture of.the hebrews is they believe that's the.weekly sabbath not understanding that.the first day of unleavened bread is a.high.sabbath.ephesians chapter 2 verse 14. that's a.big one a lot of people get this one.misunderstood so i'm just going to go.over it real quick and i'll end with it.even though there's every single one of.the verses.that my opponent has brought up every.one of them have been misunderstood i.could go through each one of them and i.have many teachings on each one of these.so for he is himself our peace who has.made both one has broken down the middle.wall of separation and abolishing his.flesh the enmity that is the law of.contained commandments as i already make.made that very clear that he's not.getting rid of the law of god or we've.got massive schizophrenia in the new.testament of disciples telling us to.keep the commandments of god to keep the.law of god and i will leave you with.this in romans chapter 8 it says this.it says this.in verse 9 it says you are not in the.flesh but in the spirit if indeed the.spirit of god dwells in you now if.anyone does not have the spirit of.christ he is not his and if christ is in.you the body is dead because of sin but.the spirit of life is because of.righteousness but if the spirit of him.who raised jesus from the dead dwells in.you he who raised christ from the dead.will also give you life so he says.therefore brethren we are debtors not to.the flesh to live according to the flesh.for we are not to live by the flesh but.of the spirit for as many are led by the.spirit of god these are sons of god for.you do not receive the spirit of bondage.he says the spirit for you do not.respect the spirit of bondage but uh.against the spirit of adoption by.abba father the spirit himself bears.witness and he goes on and says that.those who have the spirit of god.actually keep the law of god those who.are in the flesh cannot.thank you.chris roseboro will now make his 10.minute rebuttal.[Applause].all right i'd like to ask you to.consider something here.which story has better explanatory power.what i'm going to read to you is from.the writings of the early church fathers.long before constantine long before the.irrigation of the bishop of rome to.becoming the sole pope.over catholicism and ask yourself this.question.which.explanation has.better explanatory power what i'm going.to read to you.is going to basically show you that.christians from the earliest time did.not keep the sabbath in fact they make a.point of pointing out that they didn't.now is the reason why they didn't.because they understood like i pointed.out from the text that i showed you.that the mosaic covenant which is type.and shadow has given way to the.substance as hebrews says.because the law of moses has been.canceled and its obligations have been.cancelled and by the way i'll get to the.issue regarding can we then commit.adultery of course not okay i'll explain.that probably in my next rebuttal but.ask yourself this question which has.better explanatory power because.christians understood that they were no.longer under the mosaic covenant or.because of some kind of a conspiracy and.misunderstanding of the text.from the didake.written in the first century by the way.it reads as a commentary in the gospel.of matthew here's what it says but every.lord's day do ye gather yourselves.together and you break bread and give.thanksgiving having confessed your.transgressions that your sacrifice may.be pure.the epistle of barnabas barnabas is not.a greek it says this we keep the eighth.day by the way this is late first.century we keep the eighth day which is.sunday with joyfulness and the day also.in which jesus rose again from the dead.also from the epistle of barnabas.moreover god says to the jews your new.moons in your sabbath i cannot endure.you see how he says the present sabbaths.are not acceptable to me but the sabbath.which i have made in which when i have.rested from all things i will make from.the beginning of the eighth day which is.the beginning of another world.wherefore we christians keep the eighth.day.for joy on which also jesus rose from.the dead and when he appeared and.ascended into heaven epistle of barnabas.by the way.justin martyr if you have not read his.dialogues with trifoa jew i would.strongly recommend that you take the.time to do it it's a fascinating early.second century account and justin martyr.literally lived and converted you know.to christianity.early second century he was a.philosopher and he spells all this out.and so in this dialogue that he has with.a jew he's not speaking as one who is an.anti-semite in fact he's very cordial.and very kind to the jew that he's.talking to and he's explaining the.differences in fact reading this.dialogue the jew immediately says you.know you christians are kind of like you.know upstarts why don't you keep the.sabbath why don't you do this why don't.you do that why don't you get.circumcised okay.so justin who was martyred for his faith.in his dialogue says this he says he.then speaks of those gentiles namely us.who in every place offer sacrifices to.him that's jesus the bread of the.eucharist and also the cup of the.eucharist affirming both that we glorify.his name and that you profane it the.command of circumcision again bidding.them always circumcised the children on.the eight day was a type.of the true circumcision by which we are.circumcised from deceit and iniquity.through him who rose from the dead on.the first day after the sabbath namely.our lord jesus christ for the first day.after the sabbath remains the first day.of all days it's called however the.eighth according to the number of the.days of the cycle and yet remains the.first mark justin also says this he says.those who have persecuted and do.persecute christ if they do not repent.shall not inherit anything on the holy.mountain but the gentiles who have.believed on him have repented of their.sins which they have committed and they.shall receive the inheritance along with.the patriarchs and the prophets and just.men who are descended from jacob even.though they neither keep the sabbath nor.are circumcised nor observe the feasts.assuredly they shall receive the holy.inheritance of god so here.justin martyr one of the early.christians this is 60 years after the.death of the apostle john is basically.saying that those who don't keep the.sabbath are not circumcised of don't.observe the feasts assuredly they're.going to receive the inheritance why.because all of those things were type.and shadow justin also says this but if.we do not admit this we shall be liable.to fall into foolish opinion and if it.were not the same god who existed in the.times of enoch and all rest who neither.were circumcised after the flesh nor.observed sabbaths nor any other rights.seeing that moses enjoined such.observances let me translate that's kind.of tough english.justin notes the fact that adam didn't.keep the sabbath abraham didn't keep the.sabbath jacob did not keep the sabbath.the sabbath didn't show up until 2500.years after humans were created and he's.noting that the patriarchs did not keep.the sabbath and that it was moses who.enjoined the children of israel for that.and it says for if there was no need of.circumcision before abraham or of the.observance of sabbas of feasts and.sacrifices before moses well no more.need is there of them now after that.according to the will of god jesus.christ the son of god has been born.without sin of a virgin sprung from the.stock.of abraham justin also says this on the.day called the sabbath all who live in.cities or in the country gather together.to one place and the memoirs of the.apostles and i'm sorry on the day that's.called sunday sorry i put in the word.sabbath on the day that's called sunday.all who live in the cities that gather.together and read the memoirs of the.apostles or the writings of the prophets.are read as long as time permits and.then when the reader has ceased the.president verbally instructs and exhorts.to the imitation of these good things.then we all rise together and we pray as.we before said when our prayer is ended.bread and wine and water are brought and.the president in like manner offers.prayers that would be your pastor and.thanksgiving according to his ability.and the people ascent saying amen and.there is a distribution to each and a.participation of that over which thanks.has been given and those who are absent.a portion is sent by the deacons and.they who are well to do and willing give.what each thinks fit and what is.collected is deposited with the.president who suckers the orphans and.the widows and those through sickness or.any other cause are in want and those.who are in bonds and strangers.sojourning among us and a word takes.care of all of those who are in need but.sunday is the day on which we all hold.our common assembly because it is the.first day in which god having wrought a.change in the darkness and matter made.the world and jesus christ our savior on.the same day rose from the dead for he.was crucified on that day before the.saturday and on the day after the.saturday which is the day of sunday.having appeared to his apostles and.disciples he taught them these things.which we have submitted to you also for.your consideration so you see early in.the second century.justin martyr.takes the time to explain to us what.sounds exactly like a church service and.makes the point that the earliest.christians all gathered on the first day.of the week to worship to receive the.lord's supper to take up tithes and.offerings although it wasn't really a.tithe but take up a collection for the.orphans and to care for them and to hear.the word of god this is what they did.this sounds exactly like a sunday church.service and this was long before.constantine ever walked the earth before.his grand mommy and grandpappy even got.together right.in 8200 tertullian great apologist says.this we solemnized the day after.saturday in contra distinction to those.who call this day their sabbath.tertullian also says this it follows.accordingly that in so far as the.abolition of carnal circumcision and of.the old law is demonstrated as having.been consummated at its specific times.so also the observance of the sabbath is.demonstrated to have been.temporary.writing in 200 a.d.so ask yourself this question i can go.on and quote more i can quote origen i.can quote augustine i can quote a whole.bunch of other church fathers that make.it clear what's going on but early on.the christian church the earliest church.fathers all acknowledged the fact that.the sabbath was done away with they're.no longer in the mosaic covenant and.that they worship now on the day when.jesus christ rose bodily from the grave.and that he being the firstfruits of a.new creation they commemorate that new.creation the eighth day.not the seventh-day sabbath which was a.shadow the reality is in christ.is the reason why they did this because.they understood the scriptures that i.quoted to you that say that we're no.longer under the mosaic covenant or were.they.well.anti-semites people who didn't.understand the hebrew roots of.christianity and misunderstood the.scriptures or worse were part of some.conspiracy i put forward to you that the.reasonable explanation for these quotes.is that they understood just what the.scripture said that we are no longer.under the mosaic covenant it's given way.to the new covenant.jim staley will now make a seven minute.rebuttal.my opponent asked the question.are the these first and second century.church fathers quote unquote are they.anti-semites let's discover.justin martyr who he quote multiple.times to prove that church services were.on sunday which i fully agree.but the mistake that my opponent is.making is that the church had already.become apostate on this issue.as we will discover and should we trust.church fathers that had no virtually no.uh hebraic or uh training and were very.much anti-semites as we shall discover.justin martyr who he quoted multiple.times to previous case dialogue with.trifo between 138 and 161 a.d says this.we too would observe your circumcision.of the flesh your sabbath days and in a.word all of your festivals if it were.not aware of the reason why they were.imposed upon you namely because of your.sins and the hardness of your hearts.the custom of circumcising the flesh.handed down from abraham was given to.you as a distinguishing mark.to set you off from other nations and.from us christians the purpose of this.was that you and only you might suffer.the afflictions that are now justly.yours that only your land be desolated.your cities be ruined by fire that the.fruits of your land be eaten by.strangers before your very eyes that not.one of you be permitted to enter your.city of jerusalem your circumcision of.the flesh is only a mark by which you.can certainly be distinguished from.other men as i stated before it was by.reason of your sins and the sins of your.fathers that among your precepts god.imposed upon you the observance of the.sabbath as a mark.even though it was given.to abraham isaac and jacob my opponent.says that none of them are recorded to.keep it.he kept all the commandments of god it.says right there in genesis chapter 26.of which the sabbath according to the.new testament jesus himself said it was.given and made for man certainly he.would be keeping the sabbath john.christensen 3 44 a.d says one of the.greatest of the church fathers by the.way he's called the golden mouth said.this a missionary preacher famous for.his sermons and addresses said the.synagogue is worse than a brothel it's a.den of scoundrels and repair of wild.beasts the temple of demons devoted to.idol.idolatrous cults the refuge of brigands.and debacries and the cavern of devils.it is a criminal assembly of jews a.place of meeting for assassins of christ.a house worse than a drinking shop a den.of thieves a house of ill fame dwelling.of iniquity the refuge of devils a gulf.and abyss of perdition.i would say the same things about their.souls as for me i hate the synagogue i.hate the jews for the same reason.he said he would go on and quote saint.augustine if he had time i will pick up.the ball where he left off in 354 saint.augustine says this how hateful to me.are the enemies of your scriptures how i.wish that you would slay them the jews.with your two-edged swords that they'd.there should be none to oppose your word.gladly would i have them die to.themselves and live to you.on and on it goes that the so-called.church fathers.are heavily slanted against the jewish.people and against their jewish roots if.you will.because of the anti-semitism they did.not understand the scriptures they did.not speak hebrew fluently they did not.understand the jewish idioms of the day.why there was not a single one there to.explain it to them these are greek.philosophical people coming into faith.in christ which is great but.understanding the scriptures the way.that the jewish people wrote them with.something foreign to them as we already.have seen.he brings up the shadow of coming on the.tarmac and the the wife that has the.shadow you come down and you hug the.wife.i would suggest and totally agree that.the feast days the festivals are all.shadows.ladies and gentlemen the shadows.are there to lead you to the reality so.if you want to be close to the messiah.and you can't figure out where you're at.you might want to start with the shadows.which would lead you to the foot of the.messiah it's a straw man argument to say.that the shadow was done away with it's.not done away with by the mere fact that.the shadow is there ladies and gentlemen.in his own example it proves that the.shadow never leaves.as long as the sun of the living god if.you will stands behind and cast the the.light upon the sun itself it will always.cast a shadow which is why we see the.festivals and the feast days and the.shabbat which i agree.are shadows.in the millennium.if there was any time that we would do.away with the shadows would you not.think that it would be in the millennium.if there was any time that we should do.away with the shadows shouldn't it be in.the creation itself why would is it.given whatsoever.but he has not addressed.any of my contentions that the sabbath.itself was given in creation before man.sinned was never intended to ever be.taken away jesus gives us very clear.instructions that it was given to man.and he gives instructions on how to keep.it man was working in the garden ladies.and gentlemen he needed a rest.if we take away the physical from the.spiritual that's like yeshua jesus when.he tells and talks about the commandment.of murder and he gives the spiritual.principle behind it that you if you even.think of hatred in your heart.you have committed murder so he brings.the spiritual and connects it to the.physical are we be led to believe ladies.and gentlemen that because jesus gives.us the spiritual to the commandment that.the physical application has done away.with shall i not have hate in my heart.but can i still commit murder.the physical and the spiritual are.connected they are not.separate no more than a shadow is.separate.from.the reality.on the median of the first day of the.week even michael brown with the world's.expert on apologies an apologist on.proving that jew the jewish messiah is.yeshua himself and on over 20 books.says this there is no biblical support.by the way he does not believe that the.sabbath is for today he says there is no.biblical support for the view that after.the resurrection of jesus the sabbath.was changed to sunday there is some.evidence that as early as the late first.or second century believers gathered.before or after work on sundays to.celebrate the lord's resurrection but.this was not related to the concept of.the sabbath.and strong arguments can be made against.the sabbath being changed to sunday.within the new testament itself.it was not until the 4th century that.the church formally declared that the.sabbath had been moved to sunday with.the question begged to be asked by what.authority.do you do this.this is from the world's greatest.apologist.on many issues and he doesn't even.believe in the sabbath and he.understands that the sabbath being them.meeting on the first day of week had.nothing to do with the sabbath itself.thank you.chris rosebro will now make his way to.the podium for his seven minute rebuttal.i find it fascinating that one of the.world's foremost apologists hasn't read.the church fathers because i just quoted.the church fathers that showed that the.sabbath wasn't observed by first and.second century christians so apparently.world's foremost christian apologist.hasn't read those church fathers kind of.sad.anti-semitism.how is it anti-semitic for try for uh.justin martyr.in his dialogue with trifo to quote.galatians 3 19..how is that anti-semitism galatians 3 19.says this why then the law it was added.because of transgressions.pointing that out to his jewish dialogue.partner does not make him an anti-semite.okay.that's stretching the bonds of credulity.when it comes to the definition of the.word anti-semitism and also quoting john.christosome who is a great preacher by.the way i recommend you read his sermons.they're fantastic especially his sermons.on the gospel of john.i'm quoting john christoson what fifth.sixth century um has no bearing on the.quotes that i brought up from the first.and second century christian church.fathers now again remind you ephesians.chapter 2 14-15 this is not roseboro.this is scripture for he himself jesus.is our peace who has made us both one.and has broken down in his flesh of the.dividing wall of hostility by.abolishing.the law of commandments expressed in.ordinances.again ask yourself the question why were.the earliest christian church fathers.that i quoted not observing the sabbath.reason because scripture says that.christ has abolished the law of.commandments expressed in its ordinances.now regarding the question can we commit.adultery as christians now as a lutheran.i'm not supposed to quote the epistle of.james there's some kind of unwritten.rule luther didn't seem to like the.epistle of james but i have to break.that rule tonight so i hope that you.will give me a little bit of latitude.james does something very interesting in.chapter two fantastic.chapter on faith by the way and he makes.an interesting distinction remember i.told you this is all about reference and.hermeneutics and making sure you have.the proper referent.here's what james says he says if you.really fulfill the royal law according.to scripture and when you pay attention.to that what is the royal law he's.referring.to torah but specifically to the.commandment you shall love your neighbor.as yourself if you really fulfill the.royal law according to scripture you.shall love your neighbor as yourself.while you are doing well.but if you show partiality.you are committing sin and are convicted.by the law as a transgressor for whoever.keeps the whole law but fails in one.point has become accountable for all of.it for he who said do not commit.adultery also said do not murder if you.do not commit adultery but do murder you.have become a transgressor of the law.which by the way that's the purpose of.the law to show us our transgression.so so speak and so act as those who are.to be judged under the law.of liberty.james makes a distinction between the.torah and the law of liberty jesus.christ is the mediator of a new covenant.and he's the one who's given us a new.command remember jesus says a new.command i give you as i have loved you.love one another.james picks up picks up on this and says.for judgment is without mercy to one who.has shown no mercy but mercy triumphs.over judgment.christ is the mediator of a new covenant.and has given us a new law and paul in 2.thessalonians chapter 1 verses 7 through.9 says this when the lord jesus is.revealed from heaven with his mighty.angels in flaming fire inflicting.vengeance on those who do not know god.and on those who do not obey.the gospel.of our lord.right.now.regarding moral laws.there's a lot of debate a lot of ink.spilled on this but basically the.question comes down to.what function does torah.serve is there continuity or total.discontinuity between the old covenant.and the new covenant and it's important.to note this.that the commandments you shall not.murder you not shall not steal you shall.not convert adultery you shall not you.know bear false witness they all get.rolled up in the new testament but none.of the commandments regarding the.sabbath none of the commandments.regarding keeping of the new moons or.the feast days or the passover none of.those get rolled up into it so when you.talk about continuity and discontinuity.between it understand that what gets.transferred over to the new covenant.still stands.and none.of the feast days or sabbaths still.stand and this is why the christians.didn't observe them but they had.extremely high morals in fact i would.argue that the morals that jesus and the.disciples call for.are greater and more stringent and more.difficult than any of the commandments.in the torah.okay.and paul does this by the way in romans.chapter 13 he says oh no one anything.except to love each other ah love is the.fulfillment of the law right for the one.who loves another has fulfilled the law.for the for the commandments you shall.not commit adultery torah you shall not.murder torah you shall not steal torah.you shall not covet torah and any other.commandments are summed up in this word.you shall love your neighbor as yourself.love does no wrong to a neighbor.therefore love.love is the fulfilling of the law.christ has not called his church to.lawlessness.he has fulfilled.the law for us and now calls us to walk.in freedom and that freedom is loving.one another so the idea that without the.torah over us we can't we would be.immoral oh that's nonsense you haven't.read your scriptures.so.that's my last point there.[Applause].okay we now move into a new phase of the.debate as both participants make their.way to the podium.and where jim staley will conduct the.first 10-minute.cross-examination of chris rosebro.first i would like to say that just.because there's no uh.record or or an argument from silence of.the shabbat not being found by name and.commandment in the new testament does.not mean it does not exist i would like.to point out that bestiality is also not.mentioned in the new testament as a.commandment and neither is tithing both.of which all christians believe.wholeheartedly.chris.what denomination is your background.again um i uh baptized roman catholic.grew up nazarene spent some time in the.latter rain movement super hyper.charismatic which was morphed into the.new apostolic reformation.i went back to the nazarene church and.now i'm a lutheran not by choice i was.drug into it kicking and screaming okay.i don't have this question but why are.you letting that happen but in any case.you don't seem like a person that gets a.drug easily.interestingly enough in 1530.the augsburg confession of faith.is the primary confession of faith of.the lutheran church one of the most.important documents in the lutheran.reformation.and they say this uh in article 28 says.they the catholics allege that the.sabbath changed into sunday the lord's.day contrary to the decalogue as it.appears.neither is there any example more.boastful of then.than changing the sabbath day.great they say is the power and.authority of the church since it.dispensed with one of the ten.commandments and i find it interesting.that the very denomination that you.belong to also believes that it is.arrogant and actually virtually.impossible to dispense with one of the.ten commandments.my next question is do you believe that.the sabbath is part of the commandments.of god um yes it's in the torah okay so.when yeshua said to the one who asked.him in matthew 19 6 how to inherit.eternal life uh do you remember what his.answer was yeah.keep the commandments right.second table of the law right so he says.to keep the commandments.uh do you still believe that the sabbath.was part of the commandments of god.oh yeah okay so you believe that the.commandment of the sabbath is part of.the commandments of god and he says if.you want to enter in eternal life you.should keep the commandments so then do.you admit that yeshua is telling this.man to keep the sabbath as part of his.relationship to god absolutely.i can see that i just won the debate no.[Laughter].you did take me for a loop there i.wasn't expecting a yes.um.for the record my opponent believes that.jesus just told the disciples to keep.the sabbath well no he told the new.testament i told that guy and keep in.mind that's prior to jesus fulfillment.of the of the sabbath but you had.mentioned earlier that the sabbath was.not mentioned in the new testament but.we just conceded that his intention was.definitely the sabbath again there was.there's no commandment after jesus's.death rolled up in the writings of the.apostles or the prophets or jesus that.tell us to keep the sabbath and in this.particular case jesus has to keep that.because he's still under the torah.himself because he's fulfilling it for.us living in bondage right do you.believe that when jesus said in mark 2.27.the sabbath was made for man and not for.man for the sabbath that yeshua was.referring to the seventh-day sabbath.that's found in the creation account um.yes i disagree with your application of.the word anthropos okay so but you do.believe that when he says in mark 27.he's talking about the sabbath he's.talking about the the seventh day uh.that is mentioned in creation yes and.this is this is about a taxonomy issue.okay and so um.so if they are the same sabbath given to.all men.um the difference is the sinai account.is choosing a group of people in in the.way that i view this as captains of the.team to go get the rest of the team.because the the sabbath was given in the.garden before man sent and it was all.questions.all men were given you have a question.the sabbath i'm going to ask you because.you're making a statement yes do you.agree with my statement i i.there's my question okay.all right so my next question he wants.me asking this question do you believe.that the sabbath was part of god's law.yeah we've established this okay just.making sure.then what do you say that chris is the.definition of sin.definition of sin is to transgress god's.law okay uh so would you agree then if.someone breaks the sabbath that they're.transgressing the law if you are an.israelite under torah absolutely.okay so so.you're saying that the sabbath is only.given to israel absolutely okay so i.thought we just established that uh that.jesus said uh in mark chapter two that.the sabbath was made for man.and actu and asked and also paul says.that the entire world is guilty before.god you can't be guilty of breaking.something that are you gonna make more.statements.are you gonna ask me a question because.here's my next question i'd like to.answer your question actually is it.against the law for gentiles to keep the.sabbath is it against the law for.gentiles to keep the sabbath that's kind.of a category error well you said that.the the law was only given to israel so.is it against the law for the gentiles.to keep the sabbath no if a gentile.wants to become an israelite and live.under the ordinance of israel they're.they're free to do that.so is is the is the covenant you're.saying that the covenant of god was.given to israel that's correct okay who.was the new covenant given to you.the whole world.but we're grafted into israel.okay so then you are israel yes i of.course i'm grafted into israel i'm i am.a.wild olive branch grafted into spiritual.israel so if you are grafted into israel.that means you're part of the israel.covenant of which you just said that the.sabbath was given to.say that again.you just said that you were part of.israel yes you also said that the.covenant of the sabbath was only given.to israel so by extension that would.mean that you are under the law and.jurisdiction of the sabbath no.absolutely not because scripture makes.it clear that the old covenant has.passed away but the new covenant is.given to israel the that's correct the.new covenant is given to israel okay and.you are i'm part of the israel christ.okay and the covenant was given to.israel of course as well as the sabbath.of which uh there's no sabbath keeping.in the new covenant okay except for when.the jesus and the disciples were keeping.them every week um again that's when.they were under the old covenant i.thought they were under the new covenant.you remember jesus said when he dies.he says it is finished when he dies yeah.okay so when jesus is keeping sabbath in.the gospels that's what i'm talking.about after he dies so after he dies is.that when the new covenant starts.sure yeah okay so when the new covenant.starts uh in in uh when he dies.um let's talk about that for a second.and i got a few more follow-up questions.on that um.so in.uh.in first corinthians eight when it's.when paul's commands the converts to.keep passover.and that we will be keeping the sabbath.in the millennium how do you respond to.paul when is he putting his converts.under read.read the text at first john excuse me.first corinthians 5 8 and he says uh to.not well we'll just pull it up real.quick here.it says therefore let us keep the feast.of passover not with old leaven north.leaven of malice and wickedness but with.the unleavened bread of sincerity and.truth so if we're going to keep passover.according to one of the greatest.apostles ever live wouldn't by extension.because there are high shabbats within.passover he be also giving his.instructions to his converts to keep the.sabbath yeah i need to see the context.on that do you mind if i take a second.you can although.we don't have a second and the context.uh is little value to a very direct.commandment of keep the feast.first corinthians chapter five.i'll start at verse six your boasting is.not good you do not know that a little.leaven leavens the whole lump cleanse.out the leaven that you may be a new.lump as you really are unleavened.so christ is our passover lamb he has.been sacrificed let us therefore.celebrate the festival not with the old.leaven of the leaven of malice and evil.but with the unleavened bread of.sincerity and truth right he's not.saying he's not saying here in this text.that he's commanding the corinthians to.keep.the the passage so the word keep doesn't.mean keep not not again he's speaking.allegorically unless you want to argue.that the corinthians are a bunch of.leaven and a whole in a lump uh no but.they were by default that he gives them.instruction not to do it with uh with.drunkenness and mouse proves that they.were already keeping the passover but.they were doing it the wrong way right.so he agrees with your reading so you're.reading that into the text.okay i i think the text is very clear.but let's only have one minute left.chris are you married yes.uh have you ever missed a birthday or an.anniversary of your wife.not that i remember she would have beat.me if i did so my memory maybe have.lapsed okay.well listen i know that i have i will.humble myself before you at least by.seven minutes which is long enough to.get in trouble uh but let me just ask.this uh how much more if a wife can get.offended at missing an anniversary how.can we dare say that every day is alike.on earth when god specifically gives us.the the uh in the pattern of the of the.marriage that every day is not alike.that there are special days or appointed.times so if women get offended and and.people can get offended for missing.birthdays or anniversaries how much more.the god of the universe be offended if.we put aside what he says is special and.holy well i'm going to argue you're.arguing philosophy in your own opinion.if you want to talk about a text let's.take a look at a text.okay.so you agree that.there are special days and those days.should not be missed again if you want.to look at a particular text i mean i.would point you to romans 14 that says.that one person considers all days alike.and another and we already established.that was about fascinating not about the.sabbath.time gentlemen stay right where you are.and we'll do a little roll reversal here.as chris rosebro gets to grill jim.staley for 10 minutes.can we make it five yeah.in the words of the venerable.james hook from the movie hook this is.really gonna hurt no i'm kidding.i'm joking.i just wanted to say that no weapon.formed against me shall stand.jim in uh.ephesians chapter 2.verses 14 through 15.14 through 15 says for he himself is our.peace who has made us both one and has.broken down in his flesh the dividing.wall of hostility.by abolishing the law of commandments.expressed in ordinances yes sir what.does that mean.okay well if you look uh at the first.century and the term here that's that is.is uh uh is important to understand is.the wall of separation the reason why.the apostle uses the wall of separation.is because there was a very real wall of.separation in the temple that was kept.the gentiles on this side of the wall.and the jewish people on that side of.the wall it was the wall of separation.that was contained in ordinances and.commandments that were not found in.torah but the oral law of the jews that.separated the jew from the gentile that.was done away with it was those laws of.commandments as well as the sin and.bonds of our sin that were nailed to the.cross not the law of god if it is the.law of god we have big problems with.paul when he upholds the law and john.tells us to keep the commandments of god.and then in the great tribulation it's.said that the saints are the ones that.are keeping the commandments of god what.is the purpose of the law the purpose of.the law is to show people their sin and.to prove our love for god okay.do you keep it.i absolutely keep the best that i can no.questions asked no more than i keep my.wife's laws the best that i can okay is.the standard set out in scripture.regarding the keeping of the torah that.you do your best best that you can.what's the standard the standard is.perfection there's no questions asked.okay so because the standard is christ.and we are to attain.and reach for the standard of our.messiah so you do not keep the torah.i keep the torah is is as i absolutely.best can reaching for the wrong of the.messiah do you appear three times a year.before uh the lord in jerusalem not.required to.you're required to are you sure if.you're keeping torah you're required to.appear before the lord three times a.year do you know where that scripture is.yeah yeah it's actually this is the.talking about the feast days okay and.and do you know the conditions of which.we're required to.uh appear before the lord and those.conditions are not available today so.that commandment is put on pause because.the requirement is that the temple if.they're supposed to be standing if a.temple was there would you be keeping.that i suppose i would ask for him to.give me a free flight status to get.there but uh.absolutely i would do my best to always.honor my king.so you if they rebuilt the temple in.jerusalem which they will.okay then you're going to go despite the.fact that jesus is the temple.i thought we were the temple no jesus is.the temple okay jesus says tear down.this temple and i will build it again in.three days right so you're going to if.they build a temple you're going to.observe torah by traveling three times a.year to jerusalem when the temple is.built we will be in the millennium and.we will already be in the jerusalem area.so i don't think it'll be difficult for.me to show up in my king's court and.honor him okay so we have an interesting.eschatology all right question for you.um.do you receive direct revelation from.god.sometimes okay.are you a prophet.uh not in the role of prophet but i.believe in the gift of prophecy okay.are you familiar with the fact that.daniel chapter nine makes it very clear.regarding that prophecy regarding the.messiah that's fulfilled with the.destruction of the temple that along.with it the prophecy and vision are.sealed up.yes.okay.which prophecy is he talking about.that's navi and cason both of them are.sealed up.so are you a prophet.i said i in the role of prophet no as.far as the gift of prophecy if you're.referring to the gift of prophecy as.being completely rolled up and sealed up.then we have a giant prophet problem.when paul tells us in corinthians to.seek prophecy the gift which is greater.than the gift of tongues i saw a video.of yours that you did not too long ago.where you talked about a direct.revelation that you had from god at.least that's your claim as the source.regarding the book of romans do you.consider your interpretation of romans.to be inspired by god the holy spirit i.believe that it's consistent with all.the scriptures which is the basis for.understanding whether any revelation is.of god the scriptures tell us to base it.against the actual standard of the.written word of god and prophecy that.comes outside or goes against the word.of god the bible says or if it doesn't.come true is false prophecy if i.disagree with your interpretation of the.book of romans am i sinning against.yahweh it depends if you're if your.disagreement crosses the rest of.scripture then yes.okay but what if your.interpretation actually is not.consistent with what roman says it would.have to be shown and tonight i don't.believe that because a single contention.has been addressed i don't believe that.that can be shown but i am more than.humble enough to say that if that my.contentions are found and proven to be.false uh then yes uh then the.inspiration that god gave me of.understanding the book of romans from a.first century hebraic mindset would be.untrue.okay.colossians chapter 2 13 says this.therefore let no one pass judgment on.you in questions of food and drink or.with regard to a festival or a new moon.or a sabbath these are a shadow of the.things to come but the substance belongs.to christ the sentence says these are a.shadow of things to come what is the.referent.if you go back in verse 8 you will see.the context it says beware lest anyone.cheat you through philosophy and empty.deceit according to the traditions of.men according to the basic principles of.the world not according to christ so the.context immediately tells us that he's.not talking about the law of god.whatsoever that these are these are.non-believers that are coming in with.traditions and doctrines of men that.have an appearance of religion but deny.the power so what's happening is that in.verse 14 and 15 and 16 is that he's not.saying don't let them judge you for.keeping the shabbat he's saying don't.let them judge you for the way that you.are keeping the sabbath because the way.that you're keeping the sabbath is not.according to the rudiment principles of.the doctrine of men but it's according.to torah and if you continue to read the.the the context it makes it very clear.uh that who is talking here it says let.no one cheat you of your reward taking.delight in false humility and worship of.angels intruding into those which has.not been seen vainly puffed up by the.fleshly mind he is giving us an absolute.definition of jewish gnosticism in the.first century that believed in.worshiping angels cutting themselves it.is this sect of judaism that is.heretical that's trying to impose their.beliefs on how you follow torah and paul.says don't do it we believe only in the.word of god inspired by god and and.keeping it according to the spirit of.yeshua don't let them add or take away.from the word so let me see if i have.this right the the referent to the.sentence these are a shadow of things to.come is referring to pagan practices no.what was happening is that the first.century circumcision party and many.other sects of judaism were taking the.the laws of god and they were taking the.shabbat and they were focusing on them.for salvific purposes that you had to be.circumcised a certain way you had to do.this a certain way or you were not saved.and the emphasis was always on the law.for them to be accepted by god where.paul puts it in balance and says no it's.a shadow it's not done away with but the.shadow itself is pointing us to that.which is more important so don't let.them judge you for the way you're.keeping sabbath because you have your.priorities and your balance correct you.are focused on the messiah as you are.keeping the sabbath if your.interpretation is correct correct why.does barnabas and his epistle actually.argue that the christians don't keep the.sabbath.from the text that i read how come.um you know uh.you know because just like we were.sitting here in 2014 was no different in.110 in 150 or 200 or 300 is that the.gentiles don't understand hebraic.principles idiomatic expressions or the.language itself because of anti-semitism.they never sat and had a conversation.with the jew who understood the.scriptures from the perspective matter.of fact in the epistle of barnabas i.think it's the epistle bonus that you.even quoted it has jesus dying on.saturday and raising from the dead on.sunday.that's how far off so you're basically.making the claim and you made this.earlier that the church already.regarding the sabbath went apostate as.early as the late first they.misunderstood it absolutely no question.about it and if you look at history we.can go through history all the way.through from from the seven hundreds the.six hundreds even in 1492 with the.expulsion from spain of the jews the.issue of the spanish inquisition was.over the sp the sabbath so the gates of.hell prevailed against the church.contrary to christ's command what he.said the question would be the.definition of the true church um so.who's the true true church then or.whether the true church is those who.accept yeshua as their personal lord and.savior by faith no doubt about it but.they prove that faith out like james.says by doing what he said okay so i'll.leave the judgment up to god so the.church is the best that has gone through.centuries there were you say there's.chris no christians keeping the sabbath.i can show you quote after quote if a.quote historically where there were.thousands and thousands of christians.that were keeping the sabbath even in.the fifth century scholasticus says that.all of the churches were keeping the.sabbath except for the churches in rome.and alexander am i apostate because i do.not keep the saturday sabbath i believe.that if you do not keep any commandment.of god that he actually met what he said.that is a transgression against the law.okay apostate is different than.transgression against the law and yet.you made it clear that you thought the.church was apostate on this issue from.the beginning basically the end of the.first century beginning of the uh it.even said in extra biblical writings.that the apostle john was not even.allowed in some of his churches by the.end of the first century that's how uh.he even says that the wolves were.creeping in to the church at the end of.the first century they had lawlessness.that was coming and being rampant in the.church and by the way the word.lawlessness is torah less ness.um not if it's greek.and if it's written there's only one law.my friend that's the law of god actually.not of christ.okay.we're.we're down to the wire now.with only uh closing statements left.okay i gotta stay up here right they are.short.at the only five minutes each and as jim.staley began the debate tonight.he'll get the last word in chris.roseboro.go ahead and make your five-minute.closing statement.thank you.i'd like again to thank.folks at passion for truth and for jim.staley and our moderator tonight for.allowing me to.participate in this debate.now as i've pointed out.when we take a look at what scripture.says and apply sound biblical.hermeneutics we see that the mosaic.covenant has come to an end christians.are no longer under under that and this.is the reason why christians from the.late.uh first century on into the second.century and forward did not observe the.seventh-day sabbath because they.understood that christ has fulfilled all.of that now as i've pointed out before.from the book of hebrews that the mosaic.covenant is type and shadow and so is.the sabbath let's talk about the reality.and the reality is found for us in.hebrews chapter four hebrews chapter.four.talks about our true sabbath rest here's.what it says therefore while the promise.of entering his rest this is christ.still stands.let us.fear lest any of you should seem to have.failed to reach it for the good news.came to us just as to them but the.message they heard did not benefit.benefit them because they were not.united by faith with those who listened.for we who have believed entered into.that rest as he said as i swore in my.wrath they shall not enter my rest.although his works were finished from.the foundation of the world for he has.somewhere spoken of the seventh day in.this way and god rested on the seventh.day from all of his works and again in.this passage he said they shall not.enter my rest therefore since it remains.for some to enter it and those who.formally receive the good news failed to.enter because of disobedience again he.appoints a certain day today saying.through david so long afterward in the.words already quoted today if you hear.his voice do not harden your hearts for.if joshua had given them rest god would.not have spoken of another day later on.so here's the idea.the shadow itself of the sabbath would.put to death anybody who worked on it.the reality.now that christ has been revealed that.he's come and fulfilled the law for us.the reality that the sabbath pointed to.with salvation by grace alone through.faith alone by what christ has done.when we are in christ we have entered.into the true sabbath rest and to add.works to what christ has already done by.giving us that rest is to make yourself.outside.of what god has done for you so.the sabbath itself would put to death.anybody who worked on it.salvation by grace alone says if you add.any works to what christ has done in.your salvation which is a free gift.which is a gift from god and is our true.sabbath rest then you're not truly in.him and you will experience eternal.death.this is about rightly understanding what.god's word says regarding the sabbath i.hope that i've been able to provide a.good challenge for you all and i would.recommend that you don't take my word.for it never listen to anybody with an.open mind always listen with an open.bible thank you.jim were you counting on the last minute.to prepare your closing statement or are.you ready.i actually want to thank uh everyone.here at passion for truth including the.senior pastor for allowing me to come.and be a part of this.now listen for those that believe that.god meant what he said.when he told us to remember the sabbath.and keep it holy in the garden before.man sinned.we are in a win-win situation.because there's not a single commandment.that mandates believer keep the sunday.nor is there a single commandment.obliterating the sabbath.nor is there any proof anywhere in the.bible.that god changed his mind about a day.that he set apart and calls holy.as i talked about in my opening.statement and i gave my contentions my.opponent has not answered any of my.contentions that i gave of explaining.why did god give the sabbath day in the.on the seventh day in creation before.man sinned.and why did he call it holy and then why.did jesus say that was made for man and.he says that it that the the law says.that if man commits uh breaks the.sabbath that he shall be.killed.that's absolutely true ladies and.gentlemen for all of us have fallen.short of glory of god and the wages of.sin is death.he's right.the difference is that our lord sent the.messiah to die to pay the penalty for us.breaking the sabbath not so that we.don't ever stop keeping it again like.paul says shall we continue to sin.because faith came never may it be.a day that was set aside before man's.sin a day that was called the seal of.his people a day that jesus and.disciples kept all the christians kept.outside of rome and the day that we will.be mandated when he comes back.there's no commandment telling us to.stop keeping the sabbath only.assumptions.from misunderstood texts quotes from.anti-semitic church fathers that we're.looking for any way to distance.themselves from the jews.so.chris if you're right and i'm wrong.i lose nothing.absolutely nothing.but if if you're wrong and i'm right.you will have to answer to god.why you choose to follow the church.fathers who hated the jews.instead of the father of the church.who was the son and his son was jewish.isaiah 58 13 says if you keep your feet.from breaking the shabbat.and from doing as you please on my holy.day if you call the sabbath the delight.and the lord's holy day honorable and if.you honor it by not going your own way.i will cause you to ride in triumph in.the heights of the land and the feast on.the inheritance of your father jacob.the mouse of the lord has spoken.at the end of the day i've been on both.sides of the fence i've celebrated.sunday as a sabbath for 30 years of my.life the last 10 years i've chosen to.return to the christian roots of my.faith and all i can tell you is that i.can personally tell you that following.god at his word and both spirit and.truth has radically changed me as a.person.it's radically changed my marriage and.my.family it's truly a delight to come.together every friday evening.as a family and bless my children.as you'll see from the slides that.they'll put they'll they'll put up on.this on the the powerpoint.and as they move through the flies.you'll begin to see.that the sabbath is a blessing i get a.chance to bless my children and my wife.every single week i get a chance to.explain to them what elohim the bread is.the life of of yeshua himself the wine.his blood and the fruitfulness thereof.the candles and the light and explain.the light each and every week.to take away the sabbath from god's.people and call it bondage.is one of the most heretical statements.i've ever had myself which now on the.other side am embarrassed of.solomon said at the end of his life this.this is the end of the matter.all have been heard.fear.god and keep his commandments.for this.is the whole.duty of man.every one of us have two choices of who.you're going to follow.you can choose to follow the church.fathers if you'd like.but for me and my house.we will follow the father of the church.thank you.thank you very much.both our participants were phenomenal.tonight especially in terms of.playing by the rules and.great job.i want to thank everybody for being here.tonight for watching on television and i.i know it was a blessing for everybody.who listened because there was a lot of.great information shared.and.as i said this is a historic night.tonight and it's probably the first of.many debates like this we'll see but.because it's the first.you know you might want to get these.guys autographs tonight.thank you very much god bless.[Music].you.
