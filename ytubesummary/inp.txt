so we we believe that reality is in the.body now reality is in the in the.comprehension of Consciousness which is.the meaning is in the ontology which is.in the meaning of life which is knowing.ourselves.and that you know that changes.completely you know once you start you.know.recasting things in this way you see.that all of a sudden we have all the.tools to make this this Earth a.beautiful place but only if we change.our mind of who we are what life is and.what we're and what reality is for.it's you know if we say you know the.universe is pointless.which is you know Nobel Prize physicists.have said the universe the more I know.about the universe the more pointless it.is or or nature you know take nature.nature is absurd Oh no just you know.take it or leave it but nature is absurd.yeah just just that just be aware how.can nature be absurd this he has created.us then we are absorbed.I mean it's crazy this mindset is.obvious so smart we you know somebody.that we are smarter than nature I mean.are you crazy.are you crazy.you are crazy.you are absurd non-nature.we have you know who are we.I mean they did you know these are.arrogance that there is you know in an.hypocrisy but it's everywhere around us.needs to stop and it can only stop if.you change the mind of Who We Are.there is not there is no saving us other.than changing our mind about who we are.and understanding that we are.part of one.today's episode is with Federico fijin.Federico is a computer scientist as well.as an inventor and physicist who created.the world's first commercial.microprocessor he's also the founder of.the Federico and Elvia fajine Foundation.which works to support the scientific.study of consciousness.if you enjoy this content you can help.support it by joining our patreon or by.making a donation down at the link below.and so with that I'm very happy to.introduce this series of interviews with.Federico vegene.[Music].and it was in this Amelia that I had an.extraordinary experience of.Consciousness uh it was spontaneous it.was it was unexpected and I would never.have expected it I could have.experienced something like that but in.short I experienced myself as the world.that observes itself.with my point of view so I was the world.observing itself.with my point of view which was my.identity.how is that possible.you know.on top of that in that experience I.understood that this stuff that I was.experiencing which was his wide.scintillating light that felt like love.but a love so intensive so unbelievably.satisfying and joyful and at peace you.know uh that I couldn't you know I.couldn't imagine that I could be the.source of that love because I felt that.love coming out of my chest and you know.at one point it exploded and everything.was filled with this love that was me.and I recognized me in that love and so.that that kind of experience changed.completely my perspective of who I am.before I was you know separate from.everything else in the world.and now I am the world that observes.itself.and uh.my body was you know vibrating uh like.every cell of my body was following the.you know this experience.my emotions was love joy peace and my.thought was my God this is what.everything is made of you know this.twice scintillating life is this stuff.whatever you want to call it how to.reach everything is made so in that.experience I realized that my conception.of reality which was the materialistic.conception or reality that we all learn.at school.could not be right because the value the.truth value of that experience surpass.any truth value of any proof of a.theorem or anything that you can do with.indirect knowledge there was a type of.knowledge of course I can say it this.way now but at that moment I couldn't.but it was so feminine to me that that.experience told me the truth or as much.of the truth that is possible to know as.a human being of what is going on so a.form of direct experiences that then.experience again several times later in.other experiences but at that time it.was it was a sea change for me in the.sense of who I am and how does this all.reality works.um and that was the beginning therefore.of the of a journey of exploration of.Consciousness which took me about 20.years where I went to various schools of.thinking different you know different.kinds of meditations what have you uh.because obviously you know experience.you you know conscious by experiencing.it you don't know about reading books.okay that's reading books is fine but.it's not enough you you need to actually.experience because Consciousness is what.allow you to experience to know by.experiencing and uh and there are.several levels of experience of which.the most direct is what I describe.so.um so after 20 years of work.it was clear to me that Consciousness.could not be.a derivative of matter it had to be.fundamental because after all.Consciousness is what allows us to know.so it cannot be it cannot be explained.with anything that is simpler than.saying that Consciousness exists and is.what allows us to know because.everything else is knowing beyond what.but Consciousness does so there is there.is no way to explain Consciousness in.any you know with particles or whatever.you because because you know because.it's what allows us to know that there.are particles or that there are you know.forces in nature that there are other.things so so Consciousness is the.foundation must be the foundation of a.uh of what reality is.which is of course the opposite of what.science is telling us because science is.telling us the Consciousness started.with the brain you know 13.8 billion.years later more or less so that's that.didn't make any sense to me uh after.that experience it made sense before but.not you know 40 years ago but not not.after 20 years of work on myself so.which is about 12 years ago I realized.that understanding Consciousness was.foundational also for for all of us for.human beings because we think conscious.is a epiphenomenal brain and you know my.finding was that there was nothing more.wrong than that and more limiting to.human beings than that so so I started a.foundation a couple years later and uh.Dream Foundation to this for this study.of Consciousness scientific study your.Consciousness and and essentially my.goal was to bridge to bring together.spirituality which is the experience of.unity of with the universe that we all.have.you know sometime in our life.perhaps and or many of us have in the.end science which of course uh you know.we know it works when it describes the.interaction of matter and energy into in.you know in this in this reality.space-time reality but that uh is not.enough.and uh and so because my experiences.told me there had to be some reality.which is deeper than that because the.reality that we know is the reality of.classical physics is not even the.reality of quantum physics because.nobody can see a particle or or a field.we can only those are you know abstract.Notions that allow us to see the.derivatives of those which is what we.measure in space and time and and.quantum physics describe reality using.is if a space which is called hilber.space which is a which is a many.Dimension space with Dimensions that are.complex numbers so is is a completely.abstract space this stands for something.else but it stands for something more.deeper more powerful more profound the.water experiences so that brings us to.today and you know in the last in the.last couple of years together with a top.physicist.one of the top 10 in the world in the.area of quantum information we have.developed actually a theory of.Consciousness which we can talk about.later but that's the first such such.theory that to my knowledge because it.connects squarely the phenomenology of.experience with the phenomenology of.quantum information so.you know in the experience is the direct.way to know we tend to know through.reasoning for example through through.logic but that's an indirect way to know.but we have a deeper way to know which.is and and of course we know because we.experience uh even even you know in our.human life normal human life but the.scientific way of knowing is through.reasoning uh through logic which is.perfectly fine and through.experimentation experimentation is.closer to finding out to actually you.know is close to a lived experience as.opposed to just reasoning reasoning.reasoning is something that even you.know in some ways even a machine can do.but experiences is not what a machine.can do so we know because we experience.so how do I know that that was love.because that was you know.the same love that that I feel for my.wife or or My Children except multiply.by a million or 10 million uh because if.you know and it was coming out of me so.how can I have love coming out of me you.know like it was like it you know fire.Hydra you know I I you know.the water hydrants you know uh uh for a.for to put off fires I mean if he felt.like energy it was so powerful that was.coming out of me how can I generate love.but it's crazy right and then he he.explodes and he's everywhere the same.type of energy with you know white.scintillating light how is that possible.how you know it it is an experience and.my body is vibrating how is that.possible how can the body knows what I'm.experiencing I don't know I take note of.it I experience it and in fact that.experience and many others later are the.ones that guided my search for truth.because it's like we you know like in.science we are Guided by making.experiments outside in the outer world.spirituality is about making experiences.inside within our inner world so it's.the same principle except one is a.different you know one recognizes that.we have an interiority this the science.does not because when science says that.Consciousness is an epic phenomenon of.the brain.simply acknowledges that there is only.outer reality in other words the brain.makes a decision that informs you that.he made a decision and therefore you.believe that you made a free will.decision for example but that's not the.way it works you know in the way that I.experience uh all these faster reality.we have free will and the Free Will is.more fundamental than matter and.conscious is more fundamental than.matter and in fact Consciousness in Free.Will are hand to go go hand to hand.because it wouldn't make no sense to.have free will without Consciousness.because what what does it mean to decide.what you want to do you have to be.conscious to know what you want to do so.conscious what allows you to know that.what you are experiencing which includes.your intentions and what you want.are your experience and and that you can.in fact control your experience so that.is but then Free Will allows you to do.if you were not conscious Free Will.wouldn't make no sense free will be.another word for chance.because it would simply mean that there.is no law that determines what happens.but there is no but but there is no way.that you anyone could control what.happened so it would simply be chance or.Randomness which is what science is.telling us.but when you say no no wait a second I'm.conscious not only I'm self-conscious.which means that I have an identity I.know that it's me that experiences what.I'm experiencing and there and that me.is you know is an evolving sense of self.but it is it is always me you know I'm.the same me that I was when I was a kid.even if when I was a kid I'm you know I.was not the same that I'm now so that.that is what I call identity and then.the identity is what allows them to.choose with free will because that.identity is is it tells you not only.that the outer experience is yours but.also your inner experience which is one.that allows you to know what you want.what you you what your purpose is what.intentions are and and and so that there.are two two aspects to reality one inner.and one outer and and uh you know.that's it all I can say is that is that.uh there is no and that's why conscience.is to be fundamental because there is no.way to explain the fact that you have an.experience other than saying there are.experiences.you know and the experiences are.foundational the out of experience comes.then everything else including the.symbols that we use to communicate our.experiences with other entities like us.which is what we call matter so matter.is really the symbolic aspect of their.state that we manifest in our field they.feel this the field that we are is is.you know experiences itself both the.inner experience of itself and the outer.experiences that comes from observing uh.symbolic information which has to be.shareable where the experience is.private and in that communication.we know ourselves ever more and so the.in my.Theory Of Consciousness one the totality.of what exists wants to know itself.that's the fundamental purpose in a.motivation for for all of evolution is.one wants money to know itself and every.time one knows itself it creates an.entity that like him.him I should say eat or whatever but.like it you know wants to know itself.and has the power to do so he has an.identity that maintains that identity.grows evolves and so on so the evolution.of the evolution of the physical.universe is the evolution of the.symbolic forms that are used for these.entities to commit communicating with.each other to actually have an.experience of who they are because.knowing can only occur as an inner.experience.are simply the carriers of many.so in this way also you can see that.information that in physics is simply.symbolic and has no meaning whatsoever.is simply the probability is connected.to the probability of an event.in this new Theory information has an.inner reality which is the meaning and.he also has an outer reality which is.this symbolic aspect that are used to.communicate that exactly like the.information is for us I use information.and recall information what is supposed.to represent meaning that I have inside.of me to communicate with you.and in in science that meaning has been.erased Channel information simply does.not has no connection whatsoever with.information only as connection with the.symbolic aspect of of reality and with.the probability that these symbols might.appear or not that's it.the concept of true Truth for me.um.is much more nuanced than the concept of.Truth uh you know in any mathematical.sense or.because even the concept of Truth in any.mathematical sense relies on assumed.truth which is the truth of the.as assumptions or.students the one has used to then have.the logical discourse the follow so so.uh.there is it is impossible to know the.truth.of the postulates.and therefore there is is impossible to.claim that any theorem based on those.postulates could necessarily be true.they are true within the system the.axiomatic system response has chosen so.but what is truth at a deeper level.frankly.nobody knows and I don't think that it.can be known in fact if uh if one I.start from the principle the one desires.to know itself one is is the totality of.what exists wants to know itself so if.one wants to know itself is actually.seeking the truth of it of himself and.he doesn't know yet so the truth doesn't.exist uh you know.well-made you know already listed.somewhere you know like the like a bit.like the uh you know the uh platonic.truth of forms I do not subscribe to.that idea at all which is uh.uh a crucial starting point the most.most most mathematicians uh to believe.that all the forms that ever existed or.will ever exist already exist.um I don't believe that at all because.that will would correspond to saying.that one already knows everything about.himself in other words that one is.omniscient I don't believe in a one that.is omniscient it will make no sense if.uh knowing is foundational and one knows.already everything about himself he.doesn't know to build the he doesn't.this is he doesn't need to build the.world made of entities like us that are.part holes of what he is or it is uh to.actually help.help itself know itself we are.emanations of one the one to know itself.in order for one to know itself we are.collaborating with each other because we.are aspects of one we contain one within.and we want to know ourselves so so the.truth is what I I have direct knowing of.but it is also relative to me so it's.not an absolute truth.so in suffering to me is a condition of.Consciousness when someone is not is not.is not heeding the the orange that we.all have to know ourselves and to know.the world as ourselves from our point of.view so so in this context if we accept.this context then the truth is an.evolving thing is it in in an.ever-growing thing and it is synonymous.with.self no you know one.the only reason to introduce the notion.of one in my in my.model in theory is that there has to be.that there is a totality of what exists.that is evolving and that has to have.certain characteristics like it has to.be dynamic.creative and holistic because those are.the characteristics that already quantum.physics is showing to be part of the.reality that the the best reality that.we know so so we had to start already.with a concept that is the the point of.arrival of the best theory that we have.uh and that extends them and generalizes.them so one is the totality of what.exists but also the totality of what.doesn't exist yet.which is uh which is the potentiality of.one that needs to manifest and and uh.and reveal itself to one and the purpose.of one is to know itself and uh but in.knowing itself one creates units of.Consciousness like the monads of leibniz.entities that like itself want to know.themselves and they have the means to do.that so they are I call them part holes.because they contain the essence of one.Within uh and I've made the example uh.of the our body our body which is a.fundament classical physical structure.so it's not even the conscious being per.se the Consciousness is something that.has created their body that is behind it.is faster than the body itself even the.body is built up part holes because each.of our cells and we have 50 trillions of.them contains the Genome of the egg.that out of which the entire organism.developed so the the potential knowledge.of everything is contained already in.each of the parts of the body each of.these cells and and so.in the same manner then I say we as.conscious and enters with free will.part holes of one had to be part of the.one because we are built in the same.model the same with the same structure.because that's another observation that.we had the reality has a sort of uh you.know fractal structure meaning that the.same model is repeated at different.scales and so so that makes sense but of.course they had to be taken as.self-evident postulates like any posture.should be.um and so.one is a necessity to explain why we.exist and why we feel.move to do certain things instead of.others.you know by being you know in a sense.sons of one see if you want a Daughters.of one if you want to go to their way we.you know we are pursuing the same.purpose and that one is pursuing which.is to know itself and to know itself we.but but we are a point of view of one.about itself and that is the essence of.the.Awakening experience that I described.earlier I describe an experience where.you know I observe the world there was.me with my point of view.which is a point of view of the world.upon itself and so so the the uh how to.say the the reason for adopting this is.because I experienced it exactly the.same reason why you adopted law of.physics by having experiments that.showed that there is a certain law being.obeyed so you know in other words the.the starting point is not an.intellectual idea they start from who.knows where but starts from experience.the one becomes the many because being.holistic every time he sees itself he.con he knows itself.this knowing itself generates an entity.that is made of the energy that knows.itself in other words you know out of.one comes an entity which is a CU or or.monad that has the same capacity or one.is a self-reflection the one that.creates something.and in fact the principle of life is.this principle is this principle of.generation self-generation that there is.something that creates something that is.like itself.as if as a foundation of reality of all.realities so life life is not a special.case in you know what happened in this.planet but it is it is a foundation.aspect of one.every time one knows itself for the.first time it creates a unit.a unit of consciousness.the name doesn't matter but it creates.something that has the same capacity of.itself to know itself and generate Other.Self like itself.in order to continue this process.so so it is uh you know and the reason.why it has to be a part whole because.one being holistic is not made of.separable part so when he sees him when.he he knows itself he has to know it.himself entirely.but in that knowing itself entirely it.creates a point of view about itself if.that point of view about itself was all.that there was to it well then if then.if one would have known itself and be.done with it but since one is more than.that it has to create other units of.Consciousness for because after having.seen himself in that way he can he finds.out that that doesn't exhaust with who.he is and so who it is and so he has to.create another one and so on and so.forth you see.so so it it is it it is inherent in the.holistic nature of one that we have to.be part of.in pantum in in classical physics.the older parts are separable.so and also there also they are closed.in the sense that uh they have they have.close boundaries uh they don't talk to.each other they can only act with each.other by you know hitting so to speak.each other right by touching each other.by by a direct action.that's what classical physics is talking.about and everything derives from that.type of idea.where in in quantum physics uh.we start talking about systems that are.in certain States so we already already.the idea of State introduces the idea of.information but an information.that in the case of quantum physics as a.different capacity a different.relationship.then the information of a classical in a.classical.system a classical system is.deterministic and it's been a.deterministic the next state of the.system is entirely determined by the.previous state and by an algorithm that.transforms.on in a in a one-to-one fashion the.previous state into the following State.and so so there is no nothing is left to.Chance in class in classical physics.that's what determinism means therefore.the probability of the next state is.actually one.because it is what will happen.and that's the type of probability that.that is used in when you do statistical.classical statistical physics the.probability of the next of the state.you know is always one but because we.don't know a piece you know the the.ontological probability of something is.one but the epistemic probability is.since we don't know what's going to.happen we have to use a a p a.probability because we don't know but.because.this state that will happen is already.known in some way because it it will.happen because of the determinism then.the probability refers in In classical.physics to something that already exists.but we don't know.and so then.with this type of probability you can.eliminate the probability and then you.end up with another another classical.law like the the lower gases for example.which is has been derived by assigning.probability to this state of uh you know.the elementary classical particles atoms.classical atoms or molecules in which.the air is made and then you find that.within certain limits uh this classical.model predicts the the Boyle's law for.example which is the law that PV equal.KT if I remember correctly something.like that but you know but the point.that I'm making here is that that.probability is not the probability of.quantum physics the probability of.quantum physics relates to a state of.this system.that cannot be known because it doesn't.exist yet until it is measured it.occurs.when there is an interaction the.measures of the Creator State before.that interaction it cannot be known.because it doesn't exist yet.it and that's why the probability of.quantum physics refers to something that.is completely different is an epistemic.probability because it refers to.something that that we can infer by laws.or by or or you know or how to say or uh.or have a a sense of it if we could.repeat experiments enough times that we.can find that the racial uh the ratio.between what's manifests and you know.duration between between what we observe.versus the total number of observations.is a certain number and that which has.to be you know between zero and one uh.actually between if yourself at least.once it has to be more than zero but but.but but it is a number between zero.including zero and including one for.example we are always observed the the.state by repeating the experiment which.will be what would happen in a classical.system then the probability is one and.this system is deterministic but if we.if we if that is not the case we can.only tell what probability my manifest.my the the the the the the the the.laws can only Define the probability or.the determine the probabilities but not.which they will manifest so the state.they manifest.cannot be cannot be predicted because it.doesn't exist yet.and and this is this fundamental.difference between probability is is.what is being under in overlooked to the.point that uh that people talk about.quantum physics being deterministic but.deterministic in what quantum physics uh.describes which is the evolution of this.state of a system.and and that's why also uh.in the four in the Orthodox formalism.the unitarity of the Transformations has.been assumed to be uh to be fundamental.is it has to be is a postulate which.constrain the quantum state to evolve in.a reversible Manner and and therefore.the the.um the state which is described by.probability amplitudes are actually.actually evolving in a deterministic way.and that's why then people say that.quantum physics is deterministic also at.the level of uh of the quantum state but.only because they have adopted a posture.they say that it has to be that way so.that postulate is declared that they.cannot be free will and there cannot be.meaning in the universe and I was I.believe I was mentioning to you uh.earlier but I don't know if I did uh or.last time we talked that uh that uh.Professor dariano has actually shown.that the postulate of unitarity is it.has demonstrated that that is.non-falsifiable and therefore it should.not be adopted in quantum physics any.fact that there are transformations in.quantum physics uh called Atomic.Transformations which which transform.Quantum information to classical.information and then there are also.Transformations from classical to cuanto.information which therefore I don't.require the idea of collapse or the wave.function because the idea of collapse of.the wave function comes from having.adopted the postulate of unitarity.why because.if the system evolves deterministically.in terms of probability amplitudes in.the hilber space which is the space in.which these Quantum States exist then.there is there is no way to know when we.can measure something in our space and.time we had to invoke something called.collapse of the wave function or.collapse of the state Vector that that.that there is no law that tells you when.you have when it can happen and how it.can happen and and we have to take it.for good that there is going to be a.collapse and a collapse we manifest and.can only manifest a small portion of.this natural state of the system.so this uh model then this actually this.is not what I'm alluding now it's not a.model it's actually this is actually a.theory it Theory they can be falsified.or not and so it's no longer a model.in which the quantum system in a pure.state in a pure Quantum State uh.has the experience of its own State and.so.and that defines Consciousness defines.Consciousness as a Quantum system and.also we can Define uh a system even more.sophisticated than one that has just.Consciousness A system that has also.identity and a system that has identity.is one that knows that its experience is.that the experience that is having is.experience and so it is self-conscious.it knows that that in by being.self-conscious it means also that he.knows that he existed he knows that he.has an intention and a purpose and.therefore can use the intention and.purpose with free will.to achieve the intention and purpose so.so these are the fundamental uh elements.of reality in this Theory and which are.we correspond pretty closely but not.quite not entirely to the monarchs or.likeness and I have called it the past.Consciousness units and those are the.the elements where Consciousness is a.property is a fundamental property of.this of this uh entities.that however is cannot be.described separately from Identity or.separately from the capacity to act with.free will which is the capacity to.create symbols to communicate with other.entities.that that are part of this reality and.these symbols must be.made of classical information uh color.whatever you want but information that.can be shared.uh because the quantum information.represent the experience and that.experience is private exactly like.Quantum information is non-clonable.non-reproducible so the phenomenology of.inner experience is the same.phenomenology of the of quantum.information and that is fundamental.because because if you want to have a a.proper Theory the behavior of that.theory has to be similar to the behavior.of what he models so uh so so with.starting with this idea then a quantums.we we who we really are we are not the.body we are a Quantum system that.controls the body and the body is not a.classical system it is a Quantum and.classical system because all these these.cells are quantum and classical and the.body is a construction of quantum and.classical.part.a computer is made of classical Parts.switches.the switch doesn't know anything about.the whole.where each of my parts which are which.are my cells.as I said earlier have the knowledge of.the totality of what my body is because.they have G Genome of the of the egg.that created the body.and of which one cell.each cell is a partial manifestation of.that genome so so a cell a cell of the.pancreas let's say may may have the.capacity to find out something about.itself which is which is containing in.its genome.that is not being expressed yet.a transistor being a switch cannot.express anything can only express what.it was designed for to express zero or.one and that's the end of it and so it.doesn't know anything about the computer.that is constructed is a part of so you.can see already in this description that.you cannot have the the a living.organism is not like a computer you know.people talk about even the brain is like.you know like a you know like a wet wear.come on I mean this is amazing it means.not understanding anything about what.what biologists may say so then the.conscious being this the self I call it.seiti uh to indicate this special these.entities fundamental entities that have.these properties of.identity Consciousness and agency with.free will uh so this uh this uh.these entities control they may or may.not control they exist even without a.body they can interact even without a.body and they exist in a way that if.they have a body then they can.communicate with the reality which is.the reality that the body perceives.so there is a sea of symbols in the body.perceives only a small portion of the.SEO symbols transforms them into a way.into into into informations which is.essentially uh is is a form of quantum.is I call it live information it's an.intermediate form between classical.information and Quantum information.and the and in such a way that the.Consciousness can actually have an.experience of what is perceived by the.body and processed by the body.and this is exactly what happens when.our body for example controls an avatar.in a computer.and the Avatar in the computer is is not.part of this physical reality it's part.of a virtual reality is is a program in.the data inside the you know inside a.memory and but we experience it as if it.was another reality.so for example where is this space or.the characters or the trees or whatever.there is in that virtual reality that we.see they're certainly not in the in the.in the memory in the memory of the of.the computer right but we see trees and.characters in space and you know we are.they're all constructed by the.transformation of that information into.the information there are senses and our.body creates and then.into the information that our.Consciousness perceives and and as.virtually as a reality but it is a.virtual reality.the the explanation of quantum mechanics.is very simple uh since uh.you know is basically uh what we have.called collapse or the wave function.is actually a free will decision of.society and a conscious entities with.those characteristics that I described.is a free will decision so is a creation.it cannot it cannot be algorithmic.because Free Will cannot be algorithmic.so it is a free will decision that.transforms Quantum information into.classical information.and and it is in in this case coherent.with the meaning of probability because.whatever manifests.did not exist before the manifestation.wearing wearing classical physics one.manifest existed before because they had.probability one of of occurring in this.case the you know quantum physics will.only give you a probability there's.something might manifest but it cannot.tell you what will manifest what will.manifest instead is what an entity has.created.which is a free world decision.so it will manifest whatever he has.decided to manifest.now from the outside.since you don't know what might manifest.you have to call it the probability but.from the inside from the safety they.made the decision that is not a.probability that is what he decided to.do when I decided to go to a movie to an.observer on me says oh well you know he.might go to the movie I might go to a.restaurant or my and I sign a.probability various different states.that I might be in but for me I made the.decision consciously and because I.wanted you know in inco a coherent with.my intention and what I wanted to go to.the movies and so for me it's not a.probability Consciousness needs.classical memory to to uh to in order to.store its experience in other words.there is no I mean people think that you.can have one you can put into memory a.Quantum State no you cannot do that.Quantum bits cannot be put into memory.or they they they evolve they you know.and they interact and so on so there is.a continuity there is a dynamism that is.that in order for in order to uh to uh.to create continuity with something that.you experience.before you need to put into long-term.memory your experience.symbolically and the symbolic and when.you put and what you put into a.long-term memory the symbolic memory is.a is it a small portion of what you were.experiencing because what I was.experiencing was a pure Quantum state.that pure plan to say was known from the.inside but when I but I cannot clone it.I cannot reproduce it.not even I can reproduce my own State.the you know the the uh the uh no.cloning serum in quantum physics is.pretty strict about it you know no one.can you know that one to say cannot be.known period so.from the outside only a portion of it so.I can only put portions of it into.long-term memory and then recognize them.as you know as a memory of an experience.later but but uh I cannot store I cannot.store my experience.per se.the Big Bang is a way we can interpret.the equations that seem to work and have.worked well although there are many.questions still open but the equations.that we have of physics you know that.all all show that there has to be there.has to be an expansion uh for the.universe so if you reverse and they are.all reversible so if you reverse the.time then you know then this expansion.is Big to become a contraction and so if.you try to interpret what those.equations are saying you had the picture.that we call the Big Bang Theory but.that assumes that the the equations that.we have first of all have been valid.that way from day one who says so you.know I mean there is evolution of.everything but none of the equations of.physics.I mean you know so if it works you can.make it to work by Jerry rigging it and.we have made it to work but it doesn't.mean that that's the way things happen.and in fact if the if the S you know if.I'm saying that the reality that we what.we call reality uh the physical reality.is the only this the the symbolic aspect.of reality where the real the deeper.reality is the semantic reality the the.meaning the the conscious entities and.one get out of EX you know living.existing and so so then in this in this.if you start with this concept then the.physical laws have to be the development.of the language of the language of.entities that talk to each other and the.reason why language is important is.because we obey the language.because we want to communicate but it's.not the constriction that the laws of.physics you know.you know bring with them the laws of.physics are something that that's it you.know the from day one they are these.laws and forever there will be these.laws but if laws instead are really the.expression of something deeper which is.the communications or conscious entities.that communicate with each other.symbolically and the symbols since they.need to represent the meaning that it.has its own logic its own structure so.this symbolic aspect of reality has to.reflect to be proper to reflect this.more deeper symbolic structure of.meaning then the laws of symbols have.evolved with this with this self knowing.of one because they self knowing of one.you know as being evolving over time.in this model you see so so the the.entire narrative changes once you accept.it Consciousness must be fundamental.because if conscience is fundamental it.must have had an impact on the way the.the world works.but that's not what is described by.cosmology cosmology describes a world in.which Consciousness is developed 13.8.billion years ago.and one by the way did not create in.this in the sense of creation.one discover.itself you see you know you know each.Discovery is a creation but but it it is.a novelty even for one you see it's not.that one knows what he wants and creates.something I mean this is the kind of you.know old God right I mean come on this.is this is childish but you know but one.one that wants to know itself awakes and.wants to know itself and you know and.you know so all of a sudden any new.things that he knows about itself.is a new entity like I said earlier but.is is an entity that now can know itself.in turn and so now we have this.cascading of and this explosion this.explosion of entities they want to know.inside they create and and the expansion.is an expansion not in physical space.it's an expansion in the semantic space.of knowing in a semantic space of.meaning.and of which the expansion of the.universe is the correlate the physical.correlate of this expansion in this.universe.the meaning which is not this physical.universe is this physical universe is.just you know it's what we see our body.sees of a reality that we don't know.what it is.yeah I'm sure that you read the book or.Don Hoffman for example you know that.talks about uh about uh you know the.what we see is only you know it uses the.word icon on the on the you know icon.and uh the the you know icon in the in a.display right you know where where we.see an icon but the icon is a.representation is a representation of.something a much deeper processes go on.in a computer which we cannot see and.and we think that the icon is reality.but the icon is it's not reality it's.simply the way the body sees this deeper.information.uh and presented to us and we see an.icon foreign.way but you know that what we see is not.what is there I mean cognitive.scientists think that what we see is.veridical meaning it's it's pretty close.to you know what is actually here well.not not a chance not a chance I mean we.I mean here for example here in this you.know.a cubic foot of nothing that is air you.know there are now.at least a hundred thousand simultaneous.phone conversations going on if I had.the right tool the rights in your cell.phone to pick each one of them.and they're all going on here I don't.see them so do you know can I claim that.they do not exist because I don't see.them.and of course uh you know.200 years ago we didn't even know that.uh electromagnetic waves existed so they.couldn't possibly exist because there.wasn't even the Council of.electromagnetic wave.so how many other Concepts we have yet.to discover after all we have discovered.in the last 50 years the concept of dark.matter the dark energy that 75 years ago.nobody knew about it.so you see we we keep on discovering new.things then we reinvent ourselves to.reinvent our theories to include the new.stuff that we that we discover but can.we claim that we know everything that.there is.I mean you know it would be dishonest to.say so and disingenuous.the Big Bang is a representation of.something much deeper of some phenomena.which are much deeper which could never.be understood unless we say the.Consciousness existed even before the.Big Bang because the Big Bang is the is.the you know the you know is the.encapsulates.aspects of the evolution of our.Evolution which we are the creator of of.this universe collectively not me or you.collectively we all have created and God.knows how many gazillions of other you.know conscious entities there are they.collectively have created this so so.being the creators of this.we cannot accept the the laws of physics.you know we're imposed at the beginning.of everything you know it just doesn't.make any sense they had to be evolved.they had they must have co-evolved they.must have co-evolved with the.comprehension with the not self-knowing.that we have achieved over time.over you know over the eons so that then.the symbolic representation of our.understanding as all the richness that.there is but not but not all of it a.sufficient richness to to be a.representative or something which is.richer which is our experience because.our experience.being associated with being described by.represented by a Quantum a pure Quantum.State cannot be reproduced.cannot be in in in its entirety can only.be you know it can only be known in part.one bit per qubit As We Know.theoremobilibo so so you know so we can.only see.information which is shareable for.classical information which is a.shortcut a very or a small amount of.what each of us feels and you know that.you know you can understand that because.the love that you feel for someone or.for a child or for whatever then love.you can you know that is so much deeper.than what you can express in words.and words are classical symbols.shareable symbols what was really.catching my attention about everything.that you were just exploring is.um.that sense of the thing that you're.pointing to being irreducible and like.from the scientific materialist.reductionist Paradigm it's like always a.constant seeking for that which is.reducible.and like that which is irreducible.could you unpack a bit more about you.know what it means to talk about that.which is irreducible and its place in in.the world.well the if we believe this position of.course uh.one being holistic meaning that is not.made of separable parts.in fact is made of Parts which are Parts.whole.meaning that each part contains the.essence of the whole can all be you know.all the.movements intentions and you know uh.fundamental.uh.fundamental.urges that one feels are also part of.what we feel.so and I made the example that each cell.of our body has the same characteristics.because each cell of our body contains.the genome or the entire organism not.not a kid not a special genome for.itself but the Genome of the entire.organism.which Expresses in that cell only a.small portion of itself but the cell in.its own experience can then decide to.express.some other portion of digenome which is.the genome that contains the essence of.the all so we are we are organized.similarly.and that's an important distinction.between computers which are organized.using switches which are on off.Parts just switches that knows know.nothing about the the system they have.no knowledge no nothing they just they.are simply.you know replaceable and uh.separable parts of a hole that is only.the sum of its part where our body is.more than the sum of its parts.just like you know one is more than the.sum of us in terms of is knowing so this.means that uh the self-knowing whether.it is yourself knowing myself knowing.oneself knowing.they are all interconnected they are not.separable.what I know about myself is deeply.connected with what you know about.yourself and what I know about your.knowing about yourself and so.so that makes the this holistic whole.ever expanding.and irreducible means that you cannot.take any part out of the total without.changing completely total so uh you know.is it com is a counsel that can only be.understood if you understand quantum.physics because this type of holism is.the holism that occurs with the.entanglement and with the superposition.which are two fundamental properties.which are interconnected or quantum.physics this that distinguish quantum.physics from classical physics therefore.distinguish our knowing self-knowing.from the algorithms that a classical.computer uses a classical computer is.made of separable Parts is simply some.of its algorithms uh and so we have.exactly this parallel now that we can.understand why uh separability can only.work within the classical world and uh.you know where.even when you have interacting.algorithms distill the sum of the parts.the total the the whole is still the.assembly parts the sum of the.international departments there is no.part which is more than the sum of it.they can control the parts independent.from the parts.so this is why.this is why we are not machines.of course our body it can be reducible.at any instant to a machine but only the.body but not her consciousness.in our Free Will which are quantum.properties they cannot be reduced.because they have an inherentalism.that is irreducible.is the semantic space the same is that.identical with the space of that which.is irreducible.yeah the semantic space is what I call c.space this space of Consciousness is the.space.it is representable with Quantum.information.which is also irreducible Quantum.information is uh has the property uh.that cannot be copied can only be known.from the inside and this is a new.insight into Quantum information that uh.Professor dariano myself have come up.with that explain what the nature of.Consciousness as a purely Quantum.phenomenon.so you know you basically don't have.don't have the the classical properties.can never produce a Quantum property and.in fact he physically you know tell you.your face that.classical physics is a.reduction of quantum physics is a small.you know it's like a subset it's a very.small subset according to physics.exactly like a bit which is zero or one.is a small subset of a Quantum bit which.is an Infinity of State.and in fact representable as a point on.a surface on the sphere any point to the.surface of the sphere is a state of a.Quantum bit an Infinity of States two.real real number parameters are needed.to Define any one of those states where.you know a bit is zero one there is a.theorem holy was theorem that says that.when you have a Quantum system in a.Quantum State uh the maximum information.that you can get when you make a.measurement on this Quantum system is a.classical bit.per qubit.and so now all of a sudden you have a.very small amount of information.one state one classical State versus an.Infinity of states which is quarkid so.when you have you know 10 to the 50.qubits that interact which is uh.probably of the you know I don't know if.it is the order of our body but.certainly uh.maybe the our body is more like 10 to.the 30 or 10 to the 35.cubits because we don't know how many.qubits are necessary to express.a a particle for example an electron.many many thousands of qubits just for.an electron and we have uh we have 10 to.the 29.atoms in our body so so we there are big.numbers.so you share like an analytic.perspective on idealism that also.involves understandings of like science.and quantum mechanics.um that points in the direction of.idealism and so like traditionally it.seems like there have been like say two.paths to realization or attempts at.understanding what's really most deeply.true.um.historically like mysticism has been one.of these paths and it seems like if you.look at the semantic content of your own.experience deeply enough or if you look.at the symbolic content of experience.deeply enough they both seem to.eventually point back to the same thing.right so like here you're describing.going through quantum mechanics to point.at the thing but they're also say.Mystics or Saints or other people who.you know without knowing any quantum.mechanics have seemingly.come to things which seem to correspond.to.contemporary claims in quantum mechanics.so I'm curious about your perspective.about whether these two paths end up.pointing to the same thing and you know.whether you see mysticism or.self-inquiry or meditation as a.uh vertical or valid path towards.understanding say the fundamental truth.of things to be symbols and meaning are.to uh two facets.of something that cannot be separated so.they they you know I I also speak about.you know symbols creating information.space what are called information space.and and experience our meaning we're.calling what I call c-space.consciousness-based experience space.this is the space of meaning.uh the the foundational symbols are.actually the what we call particles atom.molecules which are quantum structures.they're actually Quantum structures but.they're still they appear in space and.time so when they appear in space time.they are a reduced form of the meaning.that they carry so to me those are.they're like Universal symbols they.represent the universal symbols which is.different than the words that I use.which are now Universal symbols those.are uh those are constructions over.construction over constructions uh which.we use now to communicate but the the.foundational symbols are the the one.that we recognize as uh you know as the.the atoms and molecules that that our.bodies are built for example especially.our you know ourselves and um.and so so to me.there are not two paths there is only.one path in the in and this path.requires the the understanding the the.symbolic expression uh is is supposed to.express a meaning.however the meaning is always deeper.than whatever symbolic expression you.have and it is exactly because the.meaning is deeper.that you will we we will never get to.the end of knowing ourselves and one.will never get to the end of knowing.itself because what it feels.begets more and requires more complex.symbols to express itself my body is a.symbol is a symbol made of 2 to the 29.atoms so pretty complicated symbols.Dynamic naturally because the atoms are.not arranged in a you know they're not.they're not static I mean the atoms are.are being created and they they're.they're acting in in each of my cells.are unbelievable speed and so on so.forth so so I am you know but I'm still.a symbol my body is still a symbol the.experience the this symbol is able to.capture by interacting with other.symbols in in this uh space and time uh.it is it's more portion of what is here.and uh and I can grow Within Myself in.my my quantumness I can grow my.experience myself knowing through this.experience and it is magical but is.going on but as as you can see you know.this can go on simply because we can.have these cycles of communication from.from meaning to symbols and from symbols.to meaning and the two cannot be.separated especially at the lowest level.which is the level of the atoms and.molecules which are.they reflect Quantum the quantum nature.the manifesting space time because.they're not they're not virtual.particles they are actual things in.space and time.and it's what we can measure we come.with you know so so that's what I call.live information which is a kind of.information in my book in my book.irreducible uh uh it's called live.information which is not a type of.information which is being recognized by.efficiency yet that is quantum.information that is classical formation.and there is something in between which.is live information which is the one.used by cells by the the living living.cells to communicate with each other and.with the environment and and the.difference is that uh a lifestyle uses.atoms particles atoms and molecules that.interact with each other quantumly to.essentially.experience themselves.div divide create other cells out of.themselves so the reproduction is.something that the computer doesn't do.you know because the computer is a it's.a classical system is essentially a.static system the physical organization.is static that is uh you know carries.signals but it is the the roads and the.and the you know and the the switches.are are all laid out they're not they.don't change uh you know in time they're.always the same and uh but in in inside.the cell atoms and molecules interact.move you know they they they they they.meet completely different systems as.they move and so it's a completely.different operation that uh today we.know very little about because we have.already studied Life as a biochemical.system which is not I mean by.biochemistry is the top level of the the.you know the sort of the the growth.process level but there is there are.informational processes within a cell.which we have we know nothing about it.you know you know Quantum you know there.are quantum processes especially in the.nuclear spins and all things like that.and you know the default photonic and.phononic uh interactions with we know.nothing about today and so it's uh it's.it's in the future we when we recognize.that life is a unbelievably more.sophisticated informational system than.our computers.one thing you said that caught my.attention that I was interested in was.um you said that the one will never run.out of say symbolic and semantic.expression to continue unfolding and so.that's kind of like in the direction of.infinite play or infinite self-discovery.so I'm curious if you believe in.something like the Omega point I'm not.sure if you're familiar with that.concept but it's like.you mean Omega point yeah well so I'm.not sure if that's.it was from like a I think like a Jesuit.or like something.uh yeah yeah two sticky months to.conveyor the idea that everything that.that sort of evolves and grows converges.and converges to the one very similar.but the conversion will never happen and.in the sense that there will never be.there will never be an end to it you.know the Omega Point implies that there.is the Omega point is in in a future.that will never happen you know the in.in the my this is the way I I look at it.because because if if that would happen.there would be there will be the.cessation of the universe or the.Multiverse or whatever you want to call.it so you know there will be no one will.be done it would it would be finished it.would know itself and it would be you.know will be fulfilled and it will be.the end of it.it will make no sense there will be no.longer any any mind it might be so I I.certainly cannot prove it but it would.seem to me that uh that uh it doesn't.make sense because this fundamental.distinction between.symbols that can never capture the.totality of the experience they will.always be approximations of the.experience in approximation that gets.closer and closer but then because of.the holistic nature of meaning these.numbers need connect with other symbols.in order to represent a much more.complicated you know experience and so.and so you know you will have a.complexification they will never they.will never end.one wants to know and fulfill itself and.so he he moves toward toward that never.never you know never possible you know.future but a future that is ever richer.ever more fulfilling ever ever you know.enriching and so there is a there is a.conversion in a sense of uh you know of.symbols to meaning and meaning to.symbols and uh and that continues to.grow and and and and the.complexification that we see I mean the.fact that we merge we evolve you know.with our capacity to to create computers.that can you know if themselves evolve.and learn I mean you know that's.unbelievable you know it's exactly what.uh we have done when we created cells.that can you know they can evolve and.grow and know themselves and so on so so.it's it's a you know it's the.we we are basically seeing this the same.process repeated over and over you know.this sort of fractal nature of reality.that and also uh or you know holographic.nature reality where you know the every.part contains the whole.is uh is is uh is apparent and now how.can it be why can it be that way when we.you know we have to start somewhere by.taking that is that that the nature of.reality the fundamental natural reality.and everything is follows from that it.will follow those models forever.because otherwise you you know it's it's.hard already to start this way because.you know physics we say about you know I.cannot do that I mean you cannot falsify.these things so throw it away but not.wait a second I don't throw it away.because because I consider.you know the starting point.a conscious Universe not a universe that.is unconscious and develop conscious is.13.8 billion years later you know that's.not the point yeah if you if you only.allow for the falsifiable in your.ontology then you will miss everything.that is primitive and irreducible and.semantic yeah not only that but but also.you know.also you will never.you will never be able you you will.always you know you will always work.only with the symbolic aspect of reality.this immaturity the symbolic part the.symbolic part in space and time you can.never you can never you know accept the.existence of something that uh that that.you cannot measure because if you cannot.measure you cannot falsify it so and and.that would take away exactly the meaning.and the purpose of the universe which is.this active as science has done you know.because they can approve it so so it.doesn't exist come on because you can.approve it doesn't exist.that that is a point of view that.actually Cuts Cuts your leg off.cuts are nature takes our nature out of.the picture our human nature out of the.picture and that is a fundamental.problem that we got to go beyond because.because that's exactly the cause of all.the Strife that we have and and uh you.know this you know this this uh you know.basically starting with the universe.that is solace.yeah I'm I am a proxy 01 you are a proxy.one.but then my son my daughter is a proxy.also or me.and but they're not less than me right.so there we go.anyway we're doing the same thing life.is the same done the same way.and they did it you know there isn't you.know there isn't a lesser and more you.know in the way that we we distinguish.uh things in the physical world you know.this is longer this is shorter this is.heavier you know all that is valid.within this.virtual reality that we call you know.space time with objects classical.physics and and that's valid and it's a.we say good good game that we're playing.in order to know ourselves but that's it.you know once we're done.we we may come back here and we maybe go.to a completely different game like we.changed virtual reality in computers you.know.you do you know you can have all kinds.of all kinds of different games that you.want to play depending on what you want.to know and learn about yourself.because we are the drivers we are the.you know we are in charge of our own.experience of Our Own self-knowing and.and you know because if we if it wasn't.like that who's in charge then one would.have to be in charge of everything you.know it doesn't make any sense you know.one one.you know we are not disconnected for one.so anything that we know one knows.because we are not separate from one so.to me to me this uh you know this this.you know this uniqueness that we are in.terms of the the capacity to experience.in our own way with our own Viewpoint.and controlling our experience uh is you.know it's a property that is uh.inalienable and uh cannot be lost.even when we combine we basically uh we.it's like we part of us they become you.know combined with something else and.goes its own way uh uh and it may even.be the part of me would be like a new.creation like uh you know like uh.like when I created child I mean I'm not.of course you know as a human being we.don't we don't we don't.you know we don't carry a child within.ourselves and we don't uh you know but.but if you look at a cell you know a.cell when a cell wants to you know is in.is you know the the idea that I have.when a cell is ready to combine with.another cell.uh for example it will create another.cell that will combine with another cell.of another cell and they and they.combine and so so my is you know my.Consciousness remain.with the cell that I that.created the other cell.and the combination is a new entity.that combined two cells uh uh which I I.cannot ex I cannot I cannot have that.experience that would be a new entity.that has a new experience so so that is.possible in other words.um.because if I were to combine myself I.would violate the principle of you know.of you from Quantum information it would.mean that my you know I could make a.copy of my experience which I cannot do.so you you know once you had made that.statement you cannot change it you know.if you accept it as if you know as a.postulate you know Quantum information.that represents the experience cannot be.reproduced so I may reproduce you know.an entity that is capable of.experiencing with the same structure.that I have like a cell that creates.another cell like itself but then that.has to go out of out of me has to you.know has to combine with something else.to to to grow in his own way and I stay.where I was.that's also the reason why identity.cannot be lost you don't want you know.it doesn't make any sense once created.it has to continue.you know any combination is simply.you know occurred by by you know by.reproduct reproduction so you reproduce.it you reproduce another entity like.yourself and that goes it combines with.something else.one thing that's informed your.perspective here that is um.that I'm curious if you could expand.upon more is um near-death experiences.and um.you know how they fit into this sense of.identity and reincarnation and.continuity of uh learning.yeah well the the I did not have it near.that experience.um.though I had.experiences that.were similar to what people they had.near-death experiences reported so you.know this sense of you know uh.of being.vast being you know being uh.that loves you know with the love that.comes out of me that is so incredible.and so powerful.um in that and that love is really.the essence of one I am the one.observing observing.myself through my point of view so that.that kind of experience is similar to.some of the experiences that people have.near that experiences reported so.uh uh the.the other thing is important with.near-death experience is that is that.they are showing that you don't need a.functioning body to actually have an.experience.in particular an experience which is.life-changing like a near-death.experiences being from.many if not most of the people that have.like you know near-death experiences.um you know how can you have a.life-changing experience in the positive.sense you know with with expansion a.sense of.you know love and joy and peace and.being at home and so on which are.similar to the experiences that I also.had as fundamental feelings uh you know.when the body doesn't function when the.heart is stop and the brain has no.electrical activity I mean so that that.to me is a pretty good you know indirect.proof that we don't need the body to.experience.and uh and so so.I stop here because that that already is.telling you that there is more than what.science is telling that we are because.according to science we are machines.when the machine breaks you know that's.the end of it uh we shouldn't be.conscious and uh and it should be the.end of us so.this apparently is not true because.there are hundreds of thousands of.people that have reported near-death.experiences.you know I'm always trying to make sense.of things you know understand them you.know comprehend them and that requires.uh requires a discipline that uh you.know it's like like a scientist I mean.I'm a scientist fundamentally so a.scientist I had extraordinary experience.of Consciousness that has taken.seriously instead of say oh my I had to.see a doctor BS right I I those.experiences were the most profound.experience that I had in my life why.should I see a doctor is the doctor.should see another doctor if he didn't.have any of those experiences.yeah so I actually spoke once with uh.Daniel Ingram and he was describing me.to me his work yeah he's actually.someone who spent a lot of time.meditating and what he does is he's.working to update the the DSM are you.familiar with that it's like the.diagnostic criteria for psychology yeah.so he's working to update that to.include mystical experience and stuff.like nognosis because people will go.around like diagnosing people with.pathologies or like something's wrong.with you when like actually you're.having like legitimate apprehend.function of like really important facets.of reality uh and so I think I think.what you just described is.um it basically I think it's like the.core epistemic shift that happens that.will take you from reductive materialism.to Consciousness is fundamental it's.like if you make that epistemic shift.then it unlocks everything yeah and.Medical Practice tells you that that is.a pathology and so I mean you know the.the best thing that happens to you is.pathology I mean come on.yeah so you can see why there's a lot of.pain and confusion then of course you.know and if you take seriously that that.stuff you know you don't have you're not.self for sure enough.to know that you're not stupid or you're.not you know crazy yeah then you then.you you know you're taken to an Hospital.you know and given given stuff.medication that actually makes you.stupid and.and crazy because because I mean uh.anyway I don't want to go there but but.it is a big problem today that uh you.know anything which is not normal.come back if you were if we were all.normal we wouldn't have science today.science was was was what allowed us to.go beyond normal and then make normal.what was on the eventually understood.and and therefore you know seen its.value and it became normal I mean any.any anybody that wants to do something.new science is called Crazy by.scientists because we would like to have.something a game that is finite but it's.not the case there is much more to know.than anyone can possibly know and so you.know.if you if you go if you want to know.something that is not known that is.unknown and you are called crazy because.you you propose some ideas that are.sensible to you because you had.experiences and you want to go there you.don't even get any money to to to look.at that that's why I started the.Federico never forging Foundation.because people that like me had.experiences or understanding that tell.them that reality is bigger than what.science is telling now nobody will give.me a penny of the institutions they give.money to universities to do their.research so okay so there we go there we.go.the same thing so they are classified as.crazies but those are the those are the.guys that Advance Humanity those are the.people that are Advanced Humanity people.they go out of their way galileos those.are the guys.then the church puts them in a you know.in-house arrest if they don't burn them.up like you know like uh.the poor monk Giordano Bruno right yeah.so I mean you know it was simply saying.that you know the points of light that.you see in the sky are are Suns that are.very far away.it was such a such a stupid things to.say right it was burned to the stake.okay so and we're not you know science.today often is not very different than.what I just described so.it has its uh it's Darkness.absolutely and if you go in the history.of science is one Dogma after another.that is that is you know capitulate.because because new things were.discovered and that the old Dogma.couldn't explain and there was a fight.for a while then eventually everybody.had to you know cave in and say yep yep.it's true I mean entanglement it took 80.years before you know people didn't want.entangle because entangled is saying.that.particles are connected from the inside.in ways that it could not possibly be.connected from the inside.so 1935 the epr Paradox of uh Einstein.polowsky and Rosen 80 years later it.took 80 years before all the loopholes.you know were actually answer.and lo and behold antagon exists and.nobody understands why it can exist.so it means that we do not understand.something and we should we better you.know.get our sleeves you know up and and get.to work because because it means that.that the understanding that we that we.think we have about the way reality.works is not even close to the way.reality works the theory that Ian of a.gene Theory with inconsciousness is.saying the quantum information.is representative it represents the.experience.inner experience which is private.exactly like Quantum information is.private so.that would just by accepting that you.have changed completely how reality is.described by physics.because because it means that Quantum.information.you know Quantum information is a.representation that exists interiority.in the universe.okay that changes everything I mean you.know science doesn't even today they.don't admit the interiority can exist.you know in other words interiority is.an AP phenomenon meaning it's a.phenomenon that does not exist really it.is what you think is happening but it's.not what's happening.that's what Epi phenomenon is and.Consciousness for science for most.scientists today is an AP phenomenon and.the same is true for free will now we.have a theory that says.Consciousness and Free Will are quantum.phenomena and they actually explain what.quantum physics it interprets what.quantum physics is saying in a way that.people have never understood before to.be to me now the The crucial thing is to.to have you know scientists understand.that Consciousness and Free Will are.foundational they come before matter.space and time for Christ's sake I mean.that is so foundational if that is in.foundational what is it.and and and and and this is you know you.know right in your face because uh the.phenomenology of Consciousness and Free.Will is exactly the phenomenology of.quantum information that that.isomorphism is important it's.fundamental because because otherwise.how can you you know otherwise you can.use a symbol to me to mean whatever you.want but you know if you want to have a.symbolic representation it better be.homomorphic to what you represent.in Quantum information is homomorphic to.experience and the probability of.quantum physics is homomorphic to what.you need to have free will because the.probability of quantum physics is not.the lack of knowledge of something that.you already know or that already exists.it's it's it's something it's a creation.exactly like a free will decision has to.be is known algorithmic so we have now a.way to understand quantum physics that.not only allows you know Consciousness.and free will but actually explains why.quantum physics has to be the way it is.because it's representing the inner.reality of the universe.and to me that's uh that that's a you.know that that's a fundamental that's a.revolution of thinking.you know.not GPT.one thing that I'm really interested in.now is um so we've had a lot of.discussion of your metaphysics as well.as your physics and.um I'm.curious about how this all relates to.how we act and show up in the world in.our own lives and in this point in.history.yeah that's a good question and uh.basically.what I'm going to say is not new at all.but.on on in light of the theory that we.just discussed.is saying that this is not just fantasy.basically.because we are all parts all of One.anything that I do.that hurts another.or anything that I do that the AIDS and.other eventually.will hurt or Aid myself.in other words Arc interconnectedness is.such that.if I hurt you.I'm ultimately hurting myself.if I help you I ultimately am helping.myself.and that is so foundational.that.you have to take that as a starting.point of the ontology of life as opposed.to the survival of the fittest is the.survival of the fittest.a fit.principle for life.I mean that's that's what every quantity.scientist every you know every biologist.you know they all believe that survival.of the fittest is the principle of life.is what matters.and that and the survival of the fitness.means I kill you because I'm more fit.than you.so I mean.talk just that changes completely from.this to this right completely the the.ethos that now there is justification.for you know killing someone because it.might kill you right you know and I'm.fittering you so I kill you I mean and.of course all the wars in the history is.are ample proof that uh there are many.people that think that that's the right.thing to do and so you know.start there.that changes everything.I want to offer you an open space here.um in case there's anything that feels.left unsaid or.any sort of summary of both the.metaphysics the physics and then also.this.ethos or ethical implication on all this.perspective.well it is simple uh.we are not machines.and science is telling us that we are.machines.and so the the biggest.misunderstanding is to call life a.living organism a machine.but.when the living organism already.includes the Consciousness which is a.nippy phenomenon.of the living organism so even the you.know the conscious which is if we.believe our Theory uh is actually not.even in this physical space is in a.faster reality out of which physical.space emerged as a as a reduction of the.master reality.so having just just that alone is.another point where you know where it's.a non-starter because automatically we.have thrown away any value to life.other than survival of the fittest.other than machine that is better than.another machine.that justifies all the orders that we.have seen in history so I I think that.that you know.science has to go beyond.the reductionism in materialism that.characterizes it and unless this happens.we will continue to repeat the problems.that we have seen in the past but now we.have in front of us.the global chain the global climate.change that is impending and you know 20.30 years from now will be much much.worse than exponentially worse than.what's happening now with just a taste.in the last few years of what's.Happening you know if we do not.cooperate as Humanity by changing the.idea of who we are.we are you know the future is now Rosy.the future is going to be very hard and.going to Mars is now going to help us.it's like this perspective.saves us from.the shadow of materialism.[Music].and.our own.shadow that.shows up in and through.materialism from that sense of like um.Mars isn't Mars isn't going to help us.one of my favorite quotes from someone I.interviewed interviewed once is he said.um.we need to invest in The Souls of the.machines and those souls are our own.Souls yeah but except we are not about.she yeah yeah and we're not machines.yeah.I mean the problem is that people many.scientists believe that eventually.machines will have a soul I mean this is.the crazy thing.those all those things you know the.things that you read the AI they will.take over I mean come on I mean.how can AI take over I mean if if.nothing else we are we have created a.structure that structure is now you know.basically reflecting back to us is a.circular logic like you're reflecting.back to us what we put in.and so now we say oh that thing is is.like it's independent from us what are.we crazy.I think it's nothing Dependable we.created it with our biases with our.ideas and whatever you know is an.extension of us but it is our.Consciousness our creativity that has.created those machines not our body.so we we believe that reality is in the.body now reality is in the in the.comprehension of Consciousness which is.the meaning is in the ontology which is.in the meaning of life which is knowing.ourselves.and that you know that changes.completely you know once you start you.know a recasting things in this way you.see that all of a sudden we have all the.tools to make this this earthy beautiful.place but only if we change our mind of.who we are what life is and what we're.and what reality is for.it's you know if we say you know the.universe is pointless.which is you know Nobel Prize physicists.have said the universe the more I know.about the universe the more pointless it.is oh oh nature you know take nature.nature is absurd Oh no just you know.take it or leave it but nature is absurd.we are just just that just be aware how.can nature be absurd this he has created.us then we are absorbed.I mean it's crazy this mindset is.obvious so smart we you know somebody.that we are smarter than nature I mean.are you crazy.are you crazy.you are crazy.you are absurd non-nature.we have you know who are we.I mean they did you know these are.arrogance that there is you know in an.hypocrisy but it's everywhere around us.needs to stop and it can only stop if.you change the mind of Who We Are.but it's not there is no saving us other.than changing our mind about what we are.and understanding that we are.bartol a one.it's like you are the one living in.semantic reality and because of the.metaphysics that you've bought into.you've convinced yourself of a.metaphysics where semantics actually.has no basis and is epiphenomenal and so.you've basically like made.what's most fundamental to you sort of.like fake or empty in some way and so.you get this like this nihilism this.sort of like existential dread I think.you get a lot of this in like kind of.con some forms of Continental philosophy.where.um.yeah but but the semantics are still.they're just staring you in the face but.now it's just showing up as.meaninglessness rather than wholeness.and unity and.but but it is done that way because that.allows you to keep on being egotist keep.on doing the things that you've always.done you see is it you know and people.don't know that they are moved by the.emotions that they don't know they don't.want to see and so the emotions are.controlling the brain and the brain is.only a logical machine that works when.you are in a lab and then then you are.an idiot when you're out of a lab you.know move by your own emotions you do.stupid things.so I mean come on and what I you know.anyway it's time to stop this nonsense.so sorry for the No No but but but you.know but but but really when you begin.to look at it through a you know through.a filter that that shows you that there.is more to you know to to to the.universe than what we thought and you.open us yourself to that possibility and.you begin to think about it and you say.wow my good but you know you really me.it really fits it really fits you know.you know then you can make sense of what.before was absurd.and that's really what you know where we.are today we have this opportunity but.we got to put a lot of ourselves into.it's not just to an ocean to be taken.just like that you know it means.thinking about it you know reflecting.proving it you know with experiments and.moving in this direction you know.because uh is only the starting point.but it's a solid certain point it's not.just a thought a passing thought is a.solid Point starting point and I I urge.I urge us to go in that direction.because that Direction takes us where no.other you know no other kind of ideas.have taken us scientific ideas have.taken us because they have taken us.deeper into you know symbolic reality.and by by negating the reality of the.soul the reality over interiority the.reality of meaning.and so and and now we see that it was.staring out in their face.you know and so it was just we didn't.read it properly because we didn't want.to because we wanted a war which is.materialistic reductionistic.deterministic so that we by knowing the.rules we can control the world.because we know the rules so we can tell.ahead of time what's going to happen.haha you don't like I can.I mean all this stuff that people don't.even they're not even they don't even.realize that it's going on within.themselves.the the need of control the need for.power you know the the the you know all.that stuff that basically.destroys the you know the.the love that we feel for each other the.ability to cooperate we work together to.enjoy life together.you know this is all gone because it's.all competition the survival of the.fittest come on.this is.this is not this is not the way to.save ourselves from what's ahead of us.and the planet doesn't need to be saved.because the planet will kick us out you.know.you know and we'll start over so you.know we think that you know we we are.we're going to save the planet come on.you know save yourself man.we we will be kicked by the planet out.of you know out of existence as a.species and you know maybe there will be.some new humans uh you know in a million.years from now a few Millions years from.now so you know no big change for the.planet.what once you have declared that uh you.know that uh that there is no truth.basically you know this there is.meaninglessness where do you go from.there you know basically you know you.you might as well shoot yourself because.what the hell what what are you living.for you know there is there is nothing.more uh horrendous in a way as a.starting point.unless it was proven but nobody has.proven that so you know we they all want.you to prove what you're saying but they.don't want to prove what they're saying.come on I mean you are saying that.reality the world is you know is is.meaningless.there is nothing that says that I mean.even the existence of the math with the.beautiful math that describe reality how.can that exist if this is all.meaningless these people so meaningless.there should be chaos I mean there.shouldn't be.entities like us with 50 trillion cells.that you know that within dynamism that.is unbelievable they work together so to.be you know instead of you know the the.sub fighting with each other as we go to.the bathroom you know you know they.allow us to go to the bathroom to do.what we want as a Unity.it's amazing but we're told that uh you.know that stuff doesn't matter I mean.it's it's um you know is is explainable.with with the ideas which you cannot.explain anything that has any value and.so.in truth you know also the idea of a.truth that is static as if this there is.truth and not truth it doesn't work that.way I mean truth is is a dynamic thing.that keeps on changing truth is really.the the true knowledge that one has that.is Truth by definition but that keeps on.changing keeps connecting things that.were not connected before so it's a.dynamic thing truth is truth is not.something to put into into it into a.frame.but people have the idea that truth is.you know something or you know all the.all the like like the platonic forms.they're all there I mean they're already.there from the beginning come on I mean.you know in it you know.quantum physics is coherent only in a.universe which is always expanding never.the same from moment to moment is a big.a continuous becoming a continuous.creation.is always new.that's what Quantum the probability of.quantum physics is saying that has to be.something that comes next can didn't.exist before he appeared.so.that's the meaning of probability in.quantum physics is which is not what.people think they think that.probabilities the quantum physics is.like the probability of classical.physics which is not the case quantum.physics is not deterministic.classical physics is deterministic and.therefore the probability is simply you.know our ignorance of something that.will happen by the determinism of the.system whether we like it or not.you know this state the next state is.determined entirely by the previous.state and by the algorithm which is a.one-to-one algorithm that transforms.this state on that state done.that's classical physics there is no.probability probability is a human thing.an estimate that we make in order to.understand the reality where we don't.know the formulas we don't know we don't.know you know the the algorithms we.don't know the previous state completely.otherwise we would know exactly in other.words in a deterministic reality there.is no chance cannot exist the chance.chance is only we call Chance what we.don't know but the reality is no chance.everything is determined.a computer is like that.computed that works within the program.of course if you if it has an interrupt.and you give you another program to run.that's you know you are you know then.the computer becomes an extension of you.but when the computer works it's exactly.the deterministic system like I.described.following State depends entirely on the.previous state and a one-on-one.algorithm they go from there to there.done.so.so it's there is a long ways to go but.uh but I'm I'm optimistic I think I.think that many people are today.distraught understand that we cannot.there's something must change we cannot.keep on going like this.you know it's time to rethink the.premises and uh you know so.it's a paradigm shift coming.paradigm shift is coming and uh and I.think that uh that we will all be better.for that.when we understand.that we are Eternal beings not.not crash.Federico it's been.really really wonderful connecting with.you I've had a bunch of like uh sort of.like experiential shifts and insights.throughout all of these interviews that.we've done together like sometimes.you'll say something it'll hit me and.I'll be like.uh like um particularly I remember.around.um you questioning around the big bang.and then.um also this.um sort of like um.you know the way that this experience is.an expression of the one.um these are things that you know not.only you know you help.explain your perspective on but also the.um I could feel I had experience of.um so thank you for that it was.really enjoyable and you've been so.generous with your time so thank you for.coming on and thank you for sharing all.this with us thank you for giving me the.opportunity to share and uh and then you.will share.in your own way and and that that you.know if if what I said is any value it.will you know it will it will be out.there if not it will be forgotten that's.fine too it's all it's all part of the.this is all part of the thing that's.right.thank you yeah thank you.thanks for tuning in if you found this.episode valuable you can help support.the show by joining us on patreon link.in the description there you'll
