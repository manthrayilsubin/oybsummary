the Bible contains much that is.incredibly dark there's a lot of evil.things that go on in the Bible and if we.sanitize life we're missing out on.actually appreciating the beauty that is.in society as uh by comparing it where.things that are are evil um so I don't.have any issues myself I believe that.this is a form of bondage for someone to.be spending thousands hundreds of.thousands of dollars on these elaborate.setup.there's something there that that is.deeper than just um than deeper than.just an idol it's it's it's a type of.bondage it's um it's an allegiance.almost hello and welcome to unbelievable.the show that gets Christians and.non-christians thinking about the topics.that matter to all of us today you might.have guessed it it's nearly October 31st.a lot of kids are out there planting.their costumes grados are going up.ghosts and ghouls are everywhere there's.sweets and candies being stocked up or.maybe you're avoiding it all together.there's that big question should we as.if you are a Christian should you be.avoiding Halloween should you not be are.you the type who stocks up on candy or.closes the curtains and pretends you're.not home when people come to the door.the topic is obviously Halloween where.does it come from who celebrates it is.it darker than we make it out should.Christians be celebrating it is it.harmless fun or is it part of something.much more evil there's plenty to get.scared about and plenty to talk about on.today's show and I know that you are all.in for a treat here now I want to.introduce my guest today we have Angela.USI she is a ex new AER she has an.incredible story and she talks about.that story on her website I'll read a.little bit of how she describes her.journey she spent most of her 20s um.forming sexual trauma bonds with.unavailable men addicted to weed and.entrenched in the occult she was.convinced that she was a self self.healer and this went on for a decade she.practiced yoga and she did self-help.books the whole nine yards self-care.manifestation meditation and still found.herself depressed and hopeless until she.found Jesus she has a podcast heaven and.healing and so we'll get into her story.today we also have Ray Comfort a.well-known evangelist the founder of.Living Waters and we're going to talk.about some of his views on Halloween and.how he uses it as an Evangelistic.opportun.to share his faith and we'll also be.joined by Matt Arnold who is the editor.of the Christian Paras journal and he.dives into a lot of these interesting.topics spiritual experiences the.Paranormal and so we're going to have.those three perspectives today we want.to welcome Angela Ray and Matt to.unbelievable thanks for joining us today.thank you great great to be here Billy.so so Ray I want to start with you on.this topic of Halloween you know I've.heard your story of of coming to America.and sort of having a reaction to.Halloween and the way that it was.celebrated let's let's talk about that.what was your initial response when you.saw how people really engaged in that.day yeah firstly I'd like to acknowledge.your you're all in for a treat today I.thought that was great um yeah when we.came to the US in 1989 we came from New.Zealand which is a fairly isolated.country and I was horrified my wife and.I went to the Kmart and it looked like.we stepped straight into a horror movie.we'd never seen anything like it it was.truly a culture shock and so and when I.say uh a horror movie I mean just.ghastly masks and spiderwebs and ghostly.looking figures and I actually hated it.uh and so when Halloween came around and.everybody celebrated we would as a.little family squat in the living room.and watch TV with a light off and when.people people came to our door we didn't.answer them we did that for two or three.years and then one day I thought hang on.I'm here as a Christian to reach the uh.world with the gospel and people are.knocking on my door so I opened it and.started giving them gospel tracks and.ended up giving out about a 100 tracks.that night and so each Halloween we have.used uh it as a springboard to reach out.to the unsaved so that's my little.testimony and so this has become for.your ministry Living Waters this has.actually become I I think you and I.don't want to put words in your mouth.but I've heard you say your biggest day.of evangelism one of them in the year is.that accurate oh yes it's the evangelism.day of the year it's it's when as I said.you don't have to go door knocking I'm.horrified at door knocking and I I.admire Christians that do it because I.remember as a new Christian I knocked on.some lady's door very aware that.Jehovah's Witnesses had stolen our.Thunder and so I said to her in a very.sincere tone hello I'm not a Jehovah's.Witness and she said well I am so I.actually um bristle at the bristle at.the thought of door knocking and and and.so I admire Christians that are able to.do it and take the gospel to strangers.but when people come to our door and.knock on it I just think this is a.god-given opportunity to offer them a.gospel tract and they take it put it in.their little bag and the family take.them and uh we think it's just a.wonderful night of the.year well and and you know I want you to.all Feel Free by the way as we're.talking through this to to jump in if.there's something you want to say to.respond to one another you can.absolutely do that um but Angela I want.to I want to go over to you and we are.going to later on in the show in another.segment get deeper into your actual.story how you found Faith how you left.the new age but you've come out of the.new age right and so you have this.unique perspective what is your take on.Halloween and how it's commemorated.today yeah so um a lot of people I feel.will be expecting me to go in sort of.like the origins of Saw win and I hate.to disappoint everyone but that's really.not my intention here I'm actually in.large agreement with Rey that this is a.day of evangelism I love the idea of.handing out gospel tracks with or.without candy um I had someone recommend.putting Jesus loves you stickers on like.a Reese's cup or something and then.having a gospel track there and actually.I might be jumping ahead but what I plan.on doing this year because I don't think.there's anything more valuable is that I.going to not only hand out the gospel.tracks but I'm actually going to offer.prayer to the families that come around.because let me tell you my neighborhood.is saturated with the Demonic it's like.a demonic altar on every street corner.in this neighborhood it's it's the it's.the Gastly grotesque sort of uh.decorations that Ry was talking about.they're just everywhere and so I I sense.that you know there are people in this.neighborhood that do need prayer because.I believe that this is a a form of.bondage for someone to be spending.thousands hundreds of thousands of.dollars on these elaborate setups.there's something there that that is.deeper than just um than deeper than.just an idol it's it's it's a type of.bondage it's um it's an allegiance.almost and so you know these things are.are standing out and there's I'm going.for a walk and this thing is speaking.word curses over the whole neighborhood.it's speaking word curses to all the.children um so I'm really honestly the.origins of Halloween are very dicey.there are a million and a half different.resources you can basically find what.you're looking for on this topic I'm.less interested in the origins of this.and don't get me wrong I'm all about.Origins when it comes to occultist.things I'm more about the principle I'm.more about is this really is this really.a holiday that that enables what we are.commanded to do when it says die to.yourself you know yield to the spirit.and not the flesh is this really my best.witness of Jesus Christ and the new life.that he has given me if I'm going to go.out and be conformed to the world and.celebrate with the world what the world.celebrates so that's kind of my take on.it yeah no that's that's really.interesting you know and and Matt let me.come to you on this because you.obviously might have a little bit of a.different perspective on on Halloween.and then I want to get reactions from.from Ry and Angela but when it comes to.Halloween is it something in your view.that that Christians can or should.celebrate I think um Christ has not.given us a spirit of fear but of.knowledge of understanding and I think.that when we understand the true nature.of Halloween where its Origins come from.that it is actually purely originated in.a Christian Church that there are no.Pagan influences in the origins of this.and then when we actually start to go.well what are the other things that can.be involved in Halloween such as where.did the trick or treating come from well.it came from geising what happened there.well it was praying for the dead when.the people went around when the poorest.in society would go around and uh beg.offer uh prayers for the dead um at The.Villages Villages dwellings um and in.return for soul.cakes when we look at this we realize.that Christianity is not all sweetness.and light that there the Bible contains.much that is incredibly dark there's a.lot of evil things that go on in the.Bible and if we sanitize life we're.missing out on actually appreciating the.beauty that is in society as a uh by.comp uh comparing it with things that.are are evil um so I don't have any.issues myself and I think this is one of.these debatable things this uh that you.know it's right for some it's not right.for others and I think that we can.actually just go well let's add.knowledge to our faith and uh as.Philippian says and when we have that.knowledge we can become mature in this.and we can understand that there are.certain things that yes we can indulge.in we can get involved in and there are.other things that no actually we can't.get involved in so I don't think it is.as black and white as people often make.Halloween to be out out to be so Ry you.know after hearing what Matt had to say.there you know about you this may be.good for some you know not good for.others you you look at this holiday as.strictly being something that is going.to be celebrated in a way that you're.going to be evangelizing how do you.respond to that notion that maybe people.might engage in different ways with.Halloween yeah really is a matter of.conscience Romans 14 but as a um a.chrisan I would never celebrate.Halloween um it's not because of its.Origins it's because of what it portrays.it portrays evil I mean there are kids.that show up Furies and Superman outfits.but mostly when people come to your door.they're not dressed nicely they're.dressed to frighten you horrific and the.scriptures tell us Philippians 4:8.finally Brethren whatsoever things are.true whatsoever things are noble.whatsoever things are just whatsoever.things are pure whatsoever things are.lovely whatsoever things are a good.report is there any virtue of any.praiseworthy meditate on these things so.there are certain things that Christians.should indulge in and there's certain.things should have a liberty to indulge.in and there's other things that we.shouldn't um but that's not the point.the point is that people are going to.hell that horrifies me I spend most of.my day horrified praying with a a sense.of unbelief that every day 150,000.people are dying and thinking of the.words of Jesus if your eye causes you to.sin pluck it out for it's better to.enter heaven without an eye then go to.hell with both your eyes where the fire.is never quenched and the worm Never.Dies and so when someone comes to my.door that almost certainly is unsaved.everything within me cries out I've got.to reach out to them I I every day I go.to the local College twice a day to.reason with the unsaved um because I.care about them and I love them and when.a 100 people come to our door uh on one.night of the year I I'm just delighted.to give them the good news that the gift.of God is eternal life through Jesus.Christ Our Lord and to see people given.a track and when I talk about tracks I'm.talking about tracks like this this is.one of our most popular tracks this is a.big money track what kid doesn't go.crazy when he's given this he's not.expecting something like that and it has.the gospel on the back this is called.out giant money we have million dollar.bills one of the world's funniest one.liners and so if you don't like giving.them a a a piece of candy because that's.partaken in Halloween give them an apple.and tell them it'll keep the dentist.away but whatever you do do open your.door and reach out to the lost because.that's why we're here as Christians we.to be a light in the darkness Charles.Spurgeon said have you no wish for.others to be saved then you're not saved.yourself be sure of that so love heads.up the fruit of the spirit and if we.love the unsaved will take advantage of.this night when they come to our door.yeah you know it's Angela I'd love to.get your reaction on that too because.some might argue okay well if you're.doing anything on Halloween you're.partaking in it right I I went to a.church growing up where we would do a.harvest Festival on Halloween night.right and it was an alternative it was.at the church and some would still say.well that's still partaking in Halloween.you're just doing it a different way how.how would you respond to that sort of.maybe.critique um well okay I definitely.disagree with the Harvest Fest thing.that churches do I think it is an.extremely passive take on the night I.think that it's it's more of like a.defensive response like we all have to.kind of you know as as Matt said the.Lord has not given us a spirit of fear.and to me the kind of like harest.harvestfest thing is like let's all just.gather kind of like in our little.Christian bubble and and you know keep.the kids from what's going on out in the.world and and we can still make sure.they have their candy and stuff and.maybe they'll dress up but nothing.nothing gory and so I think it's an.extremely passive thing I really.disagree with the Harvest Fest take um I.do think that we as Christians are meant.to be on the offense of the gospel and.that's why I do agree with raake that we.should be we should be sitting outside.ready to share the good news with the.unsaved that are walking by because if.you look at these people as as as.unfortunately going to hell how can you.not tell them of the one who gives you.life so Angela what would you say to.those who would say well kids are.missing out you know on opportunities if.you don't celebrate Halloween they're.missing out on what their what their.friends are doing and what culture is.doing so I would say to that um I'm.actually pregnant right now I'm.expecting my first daughter in the new.year and honestly I'm okay without with.her missing out on the world I'm okay.with her missing out on the culture I'm.okay with her missing out on witchcraft.I want her to know that she has been set.apart before the foundations of the.earth that we serve a good God who has.called us to be a peculiar people and um.I I want her to to see that there is.nothing that the world could ever offer.her that is greater than the life that.she will have in Jesus Christ so she can.miss out on the world but I never want.her to miss out on Jesus or seeing what.evangelism is like and just and what.what a what a fun I want to say fun.because living in the Lord is so much.fun um what a fun life it really is to.just be on fire for God and to really.just Place him above anything.else so you know Matt I want to come.back to you on something that came up a.little bit earlier and it has to do with.the history of Halloween you you had.brought this up but I want to Circle.back to it because there's a lot of.debate and discussion around the origins.of Halloween can you take us through.from your perspective what that history.is of how this day came to be okay.so there's been a festival of Martyrs uh.Christian Martyrs that's been around.since about the second third century and.it's been celebrated on various days.such as um just after pesak um and the.pesak week by the Syriac Church um week.after P the Sunday after Pentecost by.the Greek Church um the 13th of May was.the Festival of St Mary and All.Saints that was on the 609 ad by Pope.bonace I4 and he created he basically it.was a rededication of the pantheon in.Rome the pantheon all gods was.rededicated to St Mary and All Saints so.there was this um redeeming of of the.the old ways um for the all the the old.gods from the Roman time now when you.get to um around about.8:35 that moves to the first of November.now the idea that James Fraser from his.Golden Bell came up with was that 1 of.November oh well that's near to SN or.that's Sinn so therefore it must be that.the church was actually Pagan at.redeeming s uh se but unfortunately SE.um the it's it's an Irish thing the 1 of.November uh was not in the Irish All.Saints the Irish All Saints celebrate.was celebrated on on the 20th of um.April and so it was the French the.English and the German churches that.picked the first of November and at that.point the the uh Pope Gregory ivth.decided let's go with that church um.rather than the other ones so saen.really is not linked with uh Halloween.except they're just the same F same date.for the festival.uh it really is the very name Halloween.comes from All Hallows Eve it is a.festival of it's a Christian Festival of.to remember all the saints that went.before us uh as Hebrews 12 says you know.we are surrounded by the great cloud of.witnesses so that's what's going on with.the origins of this um so and is nothing.to do with this even uh Professor Ronald.Hutton of uh he's a professor in I think.it's Bristol University who is Professor.of pagan Britain he has said in his.books the Stations of the Sun that this.is not a pagan festival and he is a.pagan himself and he's telling his own.people look don't buy into this saen.being sort of like uh associated with.Halloween it's not Halloween is rooted.firmly and squarely in the remembrance.of the the martyrs and the saints that.have gone for us it is a purely.Christian origin.Festival yeah that that is really.interesting and you know Angela I come.back to what you were saying before too.that the concern and I don't want to put.words in your mouth but the concern is.more of how is this being celebrated.today or commemorated today right um but.understanding that history is also very.very important uh I want to get.reactions from both you and Ray but I'll.start with you Angela um before we go to.to a break here we've got a couple of.minutes but you know when you when you.look at the patterns happening in.culture right now the occult is really.prevalent you've got surveys showing 21%.of young people um in America are using.you know crystals and Tarot cards weekly.um 43% I think the number is they're.using it at least monthly why do you.think there is such an explosion of that.happening more generally right now yeah.um well the that that's a really loaded.question I do think a part of it is that.honestly.we all have this like inkling for the.Supernatural and I think a lot of people.that have were raised Christian which is.not my testimony but it's from what I've.heard people get raised Christian but.they don't see the power of God in their.churches but they see the power of the.occult and so that is one of the reasons.that I do see now in in the context of.of this particular holiday the aesthetic.of the occult and and modern day.Halloween have 100% Blended together and.I do agree with Matt that the origins.are um you like I said at the beginning.they're dicey you can find what you're.looking for on the internet I've seen.ton of a ton of pagans even satanists.even say it comes from sawin and then.I've seen the alternative that's why I.don't focus on it I don't focus on the.origins I focus on what are Satanist.saying today I don't know if any of you.have heard of John reras but I highly.recommend looking up his testimony he's.an ex Satanist he was like a high priest.of the of Satanism and he was even.married on Halloween and and then um.other other folks that you you look at.like Jenny Weaver they they all have.these these testimonies of being witches.and warlocks now my story is a little.different from that because I actually.although I was a witch I would not have.identified as a witch at the time um so.these are all folks that did identify as.witches and warlocks that take Halloween.seriously and think that Christians are.weak because we don't take things.seriously that warlocks take seriously.um and now I I disagree with pressing in.on the saw win issue and then there's.also a quote by Anton L that is actually.a false quote that where he where it.claims that he says that oh it's like.the one night a year that Christian.parents let their kids celebrate the.devil and I see that used a lot from.Christians as a reason why we shouldn't.celebrate it whereas we're I don't agree.that we need to use false information as.means of making a case against this.holiday so that's why I didn't want to.go there um as Matt was talking I was.reminded of Colossians 2:8 you know.beware be beware lest anyone cheat you.through philosophy and empty deceit.according to the traditions of men or.Mark 7 laying aside the Commandments of.God you uphold the traditions of men I'm.personally in a place in my walk where.you know I every day is All Saints Day.let's be honest um because every day.Belongs to the Lord but I don't.personally adhere to these Traditions.you know biblical feasts are one thing.but these Traditions that come after the.text it's not it's not something to me.that is worth upholding in lie of all of.the things that you can't walk into a.Walmart without seeing that Halloween.represents and I again I'm all about.dying to self really embodying you know.what scripture says and I don't believe.that partaking in these holidays trying.to justify these holidays is coming from.a heart posture of wanting to die to.yourself or that it's coming from a.heart posture of being the best witness.that we possibly can be for Jesus.because that's what this is all about.for me it's it's about Jesus it's not.about what I want it's not about what my.flesh wants it's not about what the.world wants it's about does this grieve.the Holy Spirit does this quench Holy.Spirit does he think this is.entertaining so when really approaching.anything that's what I ask myself so I.want to come to you in a minute Ray.actually Ray I'm going to give you when.we come back from the break I'm going to.let you take it but before that because.Matt you were brought up a couple of.times there I just want to give you a.chance to respond to anything there that.you would like to respond to well first.of all John Ramirez was not of Satanist.who was into Santa Ria which is.definitely not Satanism um so those that.claim or even if he claims to have been.a Satanist himself self that is not.strictly true he was brought in Sant Ria.that's what he practiced um so again we.need to make sure that we're not bearing.false witness and we don't deal in.falsehoods um a lot of this I find when.you look at the claims made by some.types of Christians regarding Halloween.um there are a lot of falsehoods and.Christians we should be dealing with.truth so if things that are patently.false are being spouted by us and we are.seen by the world to be pedlers of.untruth then how are they going to take.us seriously when we talk about the.truths of Christ um we need to be whiter.than white when it comes to being uh.Witnesses we need to make sure that the.truth that we say is the truth and not.our own personal truth um so in terms of.things like uh celebration of this.Festival I think like every thing you.have to make sure that you are fully.aware of what you are celebrating uh if.you want to go full hog with this um.myself I I don't dress up I'm 50 it's.it's not my bag um but there are people.who enjoy dressing up now there's.dressing up and there's dressing up and.I would say well you know if you've got.little kids dressing up as zombies and.werewolves and all that sort of stuff.then let's have a conversation about.what zombies mean in Christianity what.does do werewolves mean I mean Onward.Christian Soldiers was written by Sabine.bearing gold who wrote a book on.werewolves he was very much into.researching and writing about folklore.of the things he wasn't frightened of.the dark and this is again the thing we.need to be know knowing who we are and.whose we are we are christs and we have.nothing to fear of the darkness in fact.Jesus says he will build this church and.the Gates of Hell will not Prevail.against it and so you know we can be.confident in who we are and who goes.ahead of us who's gone ahead of us into.the Afterlife and returned who's.resurrected you know we can look at.these things and we can say well we can.have a don't touch approach but then.Jesus God did not take a don't touch.approach of the world he was in the.world you know he he loved the world so.much that he gave his only son for it.and so therefore we are his ambassadors.to be these point pinpoints of light in.in darkness and I think you know this.Festival itself is rooted in light it's.rooted in giving thanks for those that.have gone before us and yes just like.any other Christian Festival it's been.massively commercialized but are we.going to stop celebrating Easter and.Christmas just because the world has.decided that it's going to make a fast.Buck on it well we are going to come.back in just a moment we got to take a.quick break here and we want to know.what you think about what you are.hearing so you can send us an email and.let us know our email address is.unbelievable at premier.org.you can also head over to social media.it's @ unbelievable Fe Forex also known.as Twitter formerly or over at.facebook.com/ Premier unbelievable on.Facebook if you want to interact with us.over there we still have plenty to talk.about on this topic you're listening to.premieres unbelievable with me Billy.Hollowell and my guest today are Angela.USI great comfort and Matt Arnold don't.go away we'll be back in just a moment.with.more the mind and brain are connected.but the scientific data doesn't enable.you to establish the nature of that.connection or the relationship just.because science can't demonstrate that.physical processes and mental processes.are the same thing that in and of itself.doesn't give you any evidence that.that's not the case either some people.talk about seeing deceased relatives and.communicating with them this idea of.floating up out of your body and what.watching things happen and being able to.describe it afterwards that could be.formed in your imaginative mind.conscious experience and brain processes.are two fundamentally different things I.wonder if we're talking about you like.me to go out for a bit you guys seem.really.happy.welcome back to part two of our.discussion here today we're talking.about Halloween we're talking about evil.and so much more I've got Angela USI Ray.comfort and Matt Arnold Ray coming back.into the discussion here we just heard a.lot from both Angela and Matt one of the.questions I had asked Angela um and feel.free to respond anything that they just.said but I wanted to ask you when you.see these patterns in culture of of new.age of occultism sort of growing what do.you think is driving that I think it's a.sign of the last last days scriptures.say uh in the last days some should.apart from the faith and become seducers.of spirits um or begin listening to.seducing spirits and doctrines of demons.and we got to remember that scripture.warns us that we wrestle not against.flesh and blood but against.principalities and Powers against.spiritual wickedness and high places and.much of what we're dealing with is a.demonic world and um Angela mentioned.before about wanting to teach your.little child um just the joys of serving.the lord and I I think one of the.greatest things you can do for your.children is instill in them the fear of.the Lord a Doctrine that's uh despised.by much of the church and all of the.world the fear of the Lord but it's the.beginning of wisdom and so what I.suggest to parents if they want to teach.the kids the fear of the Lord take them.to a refrigerator open it up get out an.egg and let your kids look at the egg.and then drop it on the.floor and uh you say I can't do that yes.you can gravity will do it for you and.watch the kids' reaction and say kids.what happened they say the egg broke why.uh because of gravity gravity pulled it.to the floor and it smashed and then.just say look we're surrounded by.natural laws that are fearful uh the law.of gravity will do the to you what it.did to that egg if you jump out of a.plane without a parachute you just go.Splat on the ground let their eyes widen.there's the laws of electricity touch.raw electricity and you're going to cook.it's horrific and then teach your kids.there's such a thing is the law of sin.and death and when kids understand what.death is death is punishment from God.the wages of sin is death God is paying.us in death for our sins like a judge.look at a criminal who's committed.multiple murders and can maintains that.he's still a good person the judge would.say I'm going to show you how serious a.crime is I'm giving you the death.sentence this is your wages this is.what's due to you this is what you've.earned and sin is so serious to a holy.God he's given us the death sentence our.death will be evidence to us that God is.deadly serious about Sin and when kids.understand the fear of the Lord that God.is Holy and that he means what he says.then they begin to then they can begin.to understand how much he loves them.that Christ died for us while we were.yet sinners we earn the wages we're.we're heading for hell but God.intervened because He Loves Us he takes.no pleasure in the death of the wicked.sent Jesus to die on the cross take the.punishment for the sin of the world and.it's as simple as this we wrote God's.law Jesus Paid the fine if you're in.court and someone pays you fine a judge.will let you go and it's legal and God.can legally take the death sentence of.us because Jesus Paid the fine and his.life's blood rose from the dead to feed.of death itself so everlasting life.could come to those who repent and trust.in him when you teach your kids that.then giving out a gospel tract at your.doorway at Halloween is not just giving.someone a funny tract that they'll enjoy.you are telling them how they can be.free from the power of the Grave that.death itself has been destroyed you're.telling them that the gift of God is.eternal life so when I see families come.to my door dressed and and wear clothing.and wanting candy Etc I see them as.human beings that are fearful of.death God's put a cry in their heart.he's placed eternity in their heart and.I'm giving them water when they're dying.in a desert when your kids understand.that and they realize there's no greater.honor than to share the gospel with.unsaved people then they'll be delighted.to partake of what you're doing for them.they won't need a Harvest Festival to do.an alternative they'll say mommy and.daddy let's open the door and share the.gospel with these unsaved.people so I I appreciate that response.and you know as we sort of have been.talking about Halloween one of the.interesting things about each of your.stories you've all experienced seen or.investigated the occult or evil and so.kind of moving a little more broadly in.this segment in the next segment I want.to give each of you a chance to share.your stories and so we're going to go.one by one but I want you to also feel.comfortable jumping in asking questions.of one another even though I'm asking.the questions I'd love for you to feel.comfortable doing that and Ray since.you're already talking here I want to.start with you because in your book out.of the comfort zone which is not.exclusively about you know evil um it's.about a lot of other issues surrounding.your life and and your ministry you talk.about times where you saw true evil.manifest itself where you actually um.experienc these things and one of those.stories was a man named John um who you.spoke about at a youth church camp.encountering him can you tell us a.little bit about that story yeah it's.one uh chapter in the book chapter 10.it's called hair raising experiences and.it certainly was for me I was at a youth.camp just teaching and a guy came up to.me he said he was having problems I.think it was depression or something.we're talking 40 years ago so forgive my.memory he came in I sat him down in my.room I sat him on a bunk and I said look.let me pray for you so as I began to.pray with him he slid off the bunk onto.his back and then back arched across the.floor pushing himself with his legs in.an in a blackout State making noises you.wouldn't believe and having a spirit of.discernment I thought this is not normal.human behavior and so I began praying.exercising prayer and all sorts of.demons manifest and noises like you.wouldn't believe and ear was coming and.this is no exaggerating I I am a.Christian I believe all liars of their.part in the Lake of Fire there was air.coming out of his mouth like a vacuum.cleaner on steroids and causing his.saliva to hit the chest of drawers.probably six or seven feet away from.where he was lying it was truly like a.horror movie so when he had come to.another guy heard the sound noising I.sent away I said come back with a glass.of water for John he came back to sat.him back on the bunk and I said what on.Earth have you been into to get in such.a state and he said he'd been drinking.blood with his girlfriend while while.smoking marijuana getting the blood from.the local butcher and drinking it in a.in a sort of a satanic right and he'd.been listening to heavy metal rock music.I think one of the albums he was into it.was called If You Want Blood you've got.it and so that was just one experience.and it it really established the fact.that when you read scripture and there.are people manifest demons Around Jesus.and uh demons tried to destroy a young.Boy by throwing him into the fire and uh.they cried out and and leion and uh was.into self harm trying to uh harm himself.you realize it's true in the Bible says.we wrestle not against flesh and blood.but against principalities against.powers and spiritual wickedness in high.places you know Matt when you hear when.you hear stories like that and your.investigations and the work you've done.what what comes to mind what are you.what are you curious about what what.resonates most with.you um.well um I think for.me trying to understand what actually.demon means I mean we have a modern.understanding of demons that comes from.Buffy from The Exorcist and those sorts.of things um if you go back to about 200.ad tulan is the guy who really.kickstarts the idea that demons are.totally and abely only ever evil um if.you go back to the first century um.Jerusalem and that demons in the Greco.Romano judeo culture could be both.positive and negative um and when we.look at diamon itself as a word in the.in the Bible um it can either mean a god.of the Nations it can mean um an.intermediary being that is from one of.those Gods to humans or it can mean and.it predominantly means um deceased human.Spirits so when we see Poss taking place.I think a lot of the time we're talking.about.um interference by human spirits that.have passed over rather than non-human.Spirits um if you look at if you look at.the um if you look at the uh ideas um.there's a Johan Bloom har who is a 19th.century Lutheran pastor and he did some.exorcism work he did a lot of exorcism.work and he used to send the spirits.that came came out to his church to hear.him preach um so you know and then he.looked back and reflected on things like.uh Mark 5 and Luke 8 uh with the the.demoniac Legion and.his his ideas seemed to resonate with.what the first century Church believed.that demons were actually predominantly.human spirits that um hadn't found their.peace in Christ um when when the he.talks about the unclean Spirit it goes.through Dry and arid places when it's.cast out and then it returns to its host.um unclean has associations it's it's a.levitical ritualistic thing about the.dead so we're talking deceased human.Spirits here we're not talking.necessarily about non-human.Spirits go ahead Ray you were going to.respond yeah Matt do you have any bible.verses to back out the fact that demons.are deceased human Spirits my thought is.it's appointed a man wants to die and.after this the Judgment which Jud no it.says after that judgment it doesn't say.after that the Judgment there's a final.judgment but there's an initial judgment.when we pass over um and so do you have.any verses to back up what you're saying.these are human beings that are just.floating around well if you understand.what diom demons means in the cultural.context in which these verses are.written you will see that they are human.Spirits predominantly although you have.to look at the context of these so I'm.talking about reading the Bible Through.The Eyes the mindset and the cultural.understanding of the original writers.not a 21st century.person do you have any bible verses to.back that up yeah look at Mark.5 the demoniac is filled with unclean.spirits the unclean spirits it doesn't.say that it doesn't say the demoniac.wasn't possessed with other it says.unclean spirits it says unclean spirits.yeah C Spirits that's demons which is.unan Spirits no we're talking if you.look at the passage it says he was.filled with unclean spirits he's a.demoniac but he is filled with unclean.spirits I think what you're reading is.the Bible through the 21st century.mindset not through the original eyes.and understanding of what the word demon.actually means and numma Athos actually.means uh to do with the unclean to do.with the dead if you look at the.levitical laws uh in numbers about when.you touch an a dead body you become.ritually unclean and in the mindset of.the the Greco Roman judeo understanding.of this you would see that these are.departed human spirits well we'll just.have to we have to agree to differ well.we can agree to disagree but if you read.it through the original context that's.the conclusion that you come up with I.can read it through the original context.and I don't find that if you look at 1.Samuel 28 uh the the woman at Endor.is a b balet AET you mean the witch end.no we don't talk the word witch because.that is comes from uh King James who had.an aversion to witches and so therefore.uh put the word witch in there it's not.actually a witch if you read the.original Hebrew it is a mistress of the.O the O OB with a little hat on it that.is a departed human Spirit um this is.academic uh literature that it's talking.about this so Samuel was brought up as.an Elohim out of the ground through the.action of an ancestral spirit that was.within the ghost Mistress of uh Endor.well they're called familiar spirits for.a reason they're called yon they are.deceptive Spirits familial Spirits is a.different term it's yonim it's not the.over him or the O which is a human.Spirit if you look at this in the sorry.if you look at this in the dictionary of.deities and demons in the Bible which is.an academic work you will see when you.look up ove it actually refers you to.spirits of the dead so the Bible has.spirits of the Dead it has the eim in.Isaiah 19:3 it has the reim in various.places not the uh not the historical.ones but when in the poetic literature.the reim are the shades they are the the.noble dead the ones that rise up to meet.the king of uh Babylon when Isaiah 14.talks about it you have fantasma the.Bible is literally loaded with ghosts of.different types so Matthew so in your.view you would not see demons as Fallen.Angels or as you know that would not be.a paradigm that would fit into your.theology there a subset of uh demons.Fallen Angels would be a subset of uh.demons yes but that's how they would.have seen them you you've got the gods.of the Nations which are the ones from.Deuteronomy 328 and9 that were appointed.over the the 7 Nations um those are some.of the Heavenly hosts that fell and God.put them in judgment over uh the 70.Nations but Yahweh is isra uh Israel is.yahweh's portion um but then you've also.got um the various other places as.well so Ray I want to come back to you.on this I know we had a little debate.there a discussion about the nature of.what the Demonic could be or or is when.you you had numerous other experiences.that you described as well in the book.there there were there was a second.incident with two girls that was even.more.dramatic as you went through and feel.free to to dive into that experience as.well but you know as you've been in.Ministry for a long time and you've.encountered evil what what has this evil.shown you about god what have you.learned about God through encountering.that oh greater is he that's in you than.he that's in the world when you come up.against demonic spirits and we all do as.Christians every day you get a a a.battle against that which is evil.Temptations to do that which is wrong uh.the key is to submit to God resist the.devil and he will flee from you.um I think the the greatest lie that the.devil tells us is that we um we can't.reach the lost and that's our agenda and.I I really don't want to forget this.whole talk about Halloween and evil um.is that is the we have a we have an.agenda to go into all the world and.preach the gospel to every creature and.I love the fact that Jesus said to go.number one he said to all the world and.preach the gospel to every creature and.my agenda is that if someone is.breathing they need Christ they need the.gospel if they're not saved they need to.come to the foot of the cross repent and.trust in Jesus and then the eyes of.their understanding will be opened and.they'll see that we uh wrestle not.against flesh blood that this is a.demonic battle and they'll clothe.themselves with the armor of Ephesians.chapter 6 uh which is.um the prerequisite for every Christian.who wants to be successful in battle um.we always we always have victory in.Christ I think I shared something the.other day um with you about uh watching.sport watching rug remember that that uh.analogy I used Billy where my wife and I.when we watch rugby we w we won't watch.a game live because it stresses us out.because we get so caught up in the game.so we watch it as a rerun knowing that.we won and because we know that we have.won we never get stressed and we're.living in very very uh fearful times.we've got the Demonic realm we've got.what's happening in the Middle East.we've got um so much of the church just.having a form of godliness but denying.the power of God they're falling away.from the faith and these are fearful.times when men's Hearts will fail them.for fear of that which is coming upon.the Earth but we must never forget that.we cannot lose the Bible says of Jesus.he shall not fail nor be discouraged.that's in the book of Isaiah because he.always had the victory he knew he should.not fail and that's what we've got to.remember as Christians that with all.that which is against us and there's.certainly a lot coming against us in the.world you shall have tribulation that we.cannot fail because God's for us and if.God's for us who can be against us yeah.and that's and that's a powerful message.for the times that we're in right now.now uh Angela you're you've listened to.this little debate here that just went.back and forth on this on this topic and.we're going to get into your story um in.the next segment here but is there.anything you want to you wanted to add.or jump in on on the.discussion um well I mean to be fair I.don't have nearly the years and backdrop.of ministry as these two gentlemen have.but from my experience and from my.understanding of scripture it's that I.do I do believe that demons are.predominantly you know more within like.the the Nephilim region um and you know.speaking from my own experience just in.the.occult there were encounters that I had.particularly with my grandmother if.anyone is just listening I'm using air.quotes when I say that because that's.what propelled me into the new age to.begin with was she died she was my best.friend in the world I was desperate for.connection so I started going to mediums.and um the medium you know she knew.things about me she had no business.knowing she was describing my.grandmother she was she was telling me.what my grandom thought about me all.things that I had heard from my.grandmother herself um but of course.that's the familiar spirit that Ry had.spoken of and so I basically yoked to.this thing I I was like oh it's Grandma.great so for from 2014 until I got saved.in.2021 I was I was essentially in.communion with a demon at all times I I.wanted it to touch me it would touch me.I would ask it to hug me I would pray to.it um and right after I got saved after.I radically came to Jesus there was a.moment where I felt it uh approach me.and I yelled that I told it I said you.know and I I knew nothing about really I.really I kind of didn't know anything.about demons or or anything of that.nature yet I was so new to the faith but.I I just knew in in my spirit that I had.authority to tell the thing to leave me.alone and so I I was doing the dishes I.dropped my dishes and I said whatever.nasty unclean spirit that has been.posing as my grandmother for this past.decade you need to leave you go in.jesus' name you never come near me again.get out of my house get away from me I.mean spent a couple minutes doing that.and I never felt the thing again so um.that kind of that that whole that that.taught me the authority that we have as.Christians as Bible believing Disciples.of Jesus Christ that we have over these.principalities um but when we're in.agreement with them they kind of just.have full Reign Over Our Lives which.that thing did for a very long.time so you know Matt I want to come to.you on this and and we're going to come.back Angela to your story but you're.hearing this and Matt you're you're a.Christian Paranormal Investigator which.is a title that I'm sure some people in.the Christian World react very.interesting interestingly to um so let's.start how how do people react to you.when they hear that that's the work that.you do um predominantly when it's a.Christian we have a conversation that.the initial fear having had a.conversation with them ceases and they.realize just what that actually is.involved the idea that I'm a Christian.par Paranormal Investigator running.around like Zach beins or whatever is.just nonsense that's not what happens at.all I'm actually a trained accredit.crited uh investigator according to the.association for the scientific study of.anomalous phenomena asab and we don't.get involved in rega boards or anything.like that because that personally I.don't have um you know anything to do.with that but if there is a place where.there's reported disturbance where.there's an issue then I think as a.peacemaker a blessed Peacemaker we have.to find out first of all is this the.genuine phenomena or is this just.something like air in the radiators is.it uh there is psychological needs that.need addressing by those that are being.uh disturbed by this issue um so it is.it's definitely not like the Telly at.all it's you know the still small gentle.voice listening Lots both to the person.to the Pres.that the place and to to God and using.our loving God in using our mind as well.as our body and seeking to bring peace.and healing and wholeness and I believe.to both sides of the veil where.necessary so when you hear and and we're.going to go to a break in moment here.but I wanted to give you a quick second.to respond when you hear Angela share.what she went through we talked about a.number of things here obviously the.nature of of what demons are and we have.some different ideas and Angela actually.has another idea with Nephilim there.that you know is another prevalent.thought on that which we don't have time.to get into but if somebody came to you.um like Angela and said they were.experiencing that with what they thought.was a grandmother what how would you.explore that investigate that heal that.okay so first off you'd Sit Them Down.have a conversation just listen to is.this bringing peace to them or is it.bringing fear to them now fear is isn't.necessarily a bad thing because the.Angels appear to the Shepherds uh and.say fear not that's a big thing because.when you have a paranormal entity appear.um you're going to get scared um but it.is a case of is this genuinely her.grandma if it is we can pray for her.grandmother um is there something that.is that needs addressing that prayer can.help with um because I don't believe.that the Dead just go to sleep and they.unconsciousness um sleep as a metaphor.is beautiful because when we observe the.sleeper the sleep still exists uh but we.can't enter into their their conscious.awareness of what's going on in the the.dream state so when the Bible talks.about us being asleep it doesn't mean.unconscious it just means in a different.state of awareness that the the living.can't access um but I would just say you.know look if it's causing you extreme.fear if it's causing you to become.dependent upon your grandmother rather.than sort of like go through the geving.process and uh let them go into Christ.um then there's something unhealthy.going on there um certainly there can be.impersonations but um we don't actually.find any impersonating spirits in the.Bible except one sent by God to King.ahab's prophets um to to lie and cause.King Ahab to go to battle and end up.dying as a result that's the only.impersonating spirit that there is a.lying spirit and it's sent by God um we.don't find any other impersonating.spirits in the Bible we are going to be.going into our third segment here in.just a moment we have to take a break.but when we come back Angela and Ray I'm.going to give you a chance to respond to.this because this is actually a a big.topic and then we'll get into your story.um Angela if you are watching this we.want to know what you are thinking about.what you're hearing and seeing you can.send us an email again our email address.is unbelievable at premier.org.you can also get in touch with us on X.it's at unbelievable Fe and we're on.Facebook at.facebook.com/ Premier unbelievable we.still have plenty to talk about on the.other side of the break I'm here with.Angela USI Ray comfort and Matt Arnold.don't go away we'll be back in just a.moment you would call yourself an.atheist I would yes I would call myself.a Christian humanist one of the big.themes over the history of what we now.think of as science has been questioning.the exceptionalism of humankind I think.the critical thing is what gives.something value would you say that mind.construct meaning or detect meaning I.have had made from a little piece of my.arm something that could reasonably be.called a second brain I think one of the.real challenges that evolution by.natural selection puts to to Christian.belief is the idea.that welcome back to part three of our.discussion here on unbelievable we're.talking about Halloween we're also.talking much more Broad about evil and.the stories of our incredible guests.Angela USI Ray comfort and Matt Arnold.now at the end of our last segment there.uh Matt went through some some of his.thoughts on how he would heal a.situation like what Angela was.describing with her grandmother uh Ry I.want to come to you first on this uh.because obviously you very likely have.some different ideas about what you.would do in a situation like this or.what you would recommend so how would.you heal a situation where somebody like.Angel is coming and saying that they're.interacting with what they believe to be.a deceased loved one yeah it's obviously.a demon a familiar Spirit but what I'd.like to do if I may like to ask Matt.could you very briefly share your.testimony how you were born again.um yeah sure I went to a Baptist Church.and I accepted Christ into my life as.Lord and Savior back at 14 I got.baptized shortly.afterwards in 2014 no uh sorry no at the.age of 14 it 1987 age of 14 yeah.1987 you got me a little mystified here.do you believe the Bible that all.scripture is given by inspiration of God.yes and what do you mean by.inspiration well that it's God breathed.that you can rely what do you mean by.God breathed I I believe you can trust.it yes although there are scri textual.errors in certain places there are.slight discrepancies so you do believe.that demons manifest uh Around Jesus and.the disciples and through the book of.Acts and that we don't wrestle against.flesh and blood but against demonic.forces so you do believe that because.you had me confused because if someone.came to me and said I'm I'm talking to.myad can you back up a bit did you say I.don't believe in that or I do no I said.you you you do I asked if you do.obviously you do yeah because if someone.came to me and said I'm talking to my.dead grandmother I I would say you're.not you're talking to a familiar spirit.and you need you need to submit to God.resist the devil and you flee from can I.ask you why you would say that she's not.the dead.grandmother because dead grandmother.don't float around nobody said they.float around they can't find any verses.saying that um if you look at the if you.look at the.Transfiguration Jesus speaks of the.deceased Moses he's been dead over a.thousand years so we've got Jesus.speaking to dead people here so do you.pray to Moses I don't pray to Moses but.Jesus was speaking to him well do you.talk to Moses I don't talk to Moses.because I have no need to talk to Moses.so do you talk to any dead people that.are floating if I if um so my mother.died in April this year okay I pray for.my mother because I believe that she is.still continuing a journey into God that.is a very earliest Christian and yes.sometimes I will say oh Mom you know you.never believe what happened today I.don't believe there's anything evil in.what I've done firstly M I'm sorry I'm.sorry your mother died my parents have.passed on too so it's a very horrible.thing to to think but if this is what I.people who talk to dead relatives so.when you're talking to your dead.relative and you fly across maybe to.Paris on a 747 or whatever are they in.the plane with you or are they flying by.the plane outside the window since we're.surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses.I mean I'm a physics teacher so I'm a.physicist right I believe and I know.that there is a hypers space there is a.dimension above us that is not limited.by the three-dimensional Geographic.bound binds that we have today so why.shouldn't my mother if she wishes which.I don't think she would necessarily do.but why shouldn't she necessarily be.there I mean they're not limited by the.same bounds when we die we don't.physically zip a billion light years.away from here into outside of the.universe we're still part of the.creation so is your mother omnipresent.like God does she see everything and.know that's putting words into her mouth.she's not omn present now well you can.talk to her anywhere anytime day or.night and she's ready and waiting listen.to you I wouldn't necessarily say that.she's listening because she might not be.there just like I might say oh Joe and.my wife and she's not.there I'm I'm not actually seeking.initiating contact with the de I'm just.saying oh Mom you know you'll never.guess what happened today um and and I'm.not becoming dependent upon that and.that's the important bit when people go.and seek mediums and that sort of stuff.right we're not talking a dependency.here we're talking about an active.awareness of the great cloud of.witnesses that are cheering us on in our.walk with Christ and the you know the.two of you it's interesting hearing you.go back and and forth on this um because.these are these are obviously topics.whether you're watching this or.listening and you're and you're a.Christian or an atheist wherever you are.these are things that people are.experiencing and these are two very.different takes on you know on how to.process that and it was Angel it was.your story that sparked this.conversation uh this part of the.conversation and as we're talking about.you know Halloween this is a time of.year when these things come up but I do.I do want to Pivot into you know your.testimony because you said it was your.grandmother's death really that sparked.this obviously and so once you started.going into this because you talked about.that 10year period that this went on how.quickly Did you sort of dive into the E.call and how what did that look like.take us through some of those.experiences yeah so um I guess I should.mention that just because I'm just.hearing the discourse back and forth um.I was in a the way I would have.perceived it then is that my grandmother.the what I do genuinely believe heart.and soul scripturally and just.experientially she that was the demon.that was not her she died um.and that that demon brought me peace I.will say that but it was very much so.the embodiment of 2 Corinthians 11:14.Satan masquerades is an angel of Light.because it was a false it was a false.piece and it was a it was a a piece if.you will that that only led me um it was.like a domino effect because it led me.down this path of believing that I was.able to commune with Spirits like this.and that I could actually help other.people around me do the same thing um so.that kind of springboarded from mediums.to cards to crystals.to all the books on you know how I can.develop my own quote psychic ability or.talk to the dead.XYZ um and then that led to becoming.interested in my own energy body I don't.know if you have this like on an audio.I'm using a lot of air quotes my own.energy body um and and and when I say.that this this was happening this was.happening over again a 10-year period so.it was like a slow drip because I I.always say that Satan will give you he.doesn't just give you a chain and say.here he gives you links and so that's.really what it was for me it was like.one Link at a time very slow drip that I.didn't realize what was happening but I.was desperate and and I thought I was.being spiritual I thought I was good.like I mentioned before I would have.never called myself a witch ever if I.was pressed to call myself anything it.would have been a light worker um you.know I started doing yoga I lost a lot.of weight you know because I was my.grandom was very heavy when she died and.I I sort of adopted her habits as a.young child because we were so close and.so when she died it was Amplified where.I I bing jate and all these things but I.wanted to really change the Paradigm of.that so I got healthy which led to yoga.but yoga was was was great for me.because it was a combination of both the.physical and the spiritual I thought.well I can have all the the the cool you.know spiritual stuff with the crystals.and the chakras and all these things and.also get healthy at the same time so.yoga became very quickly when I found it.my thing I became a yoga teacher.certified yoga teacher did and I was.teaching people right up until the week.of my salvation um I got into a.astrology astrology became my Niche I.had a I had a podcast where I would.share weekly or bi-weekly rather new.moon and full moon reports which was all.with the intention of helping people on.their their quote self-healing Journey.um you know because I I believed that.that the moon H had a profound influence.over our lives and whatever zodiac.season we were in had a profound.influence and as long as we attuned to.those energies that we would you know.really be able to navigate through this.Human Experience and follow our birth.chart and I and this was this is all.like with the backdrop of of believing.that like my grandmother is one of my.Spirit guides leading me to do all these.things and showing me to all these.things um now that was like 10 years of.of new age essentially before I got.involved in New Age I I grew up in the.Catholic Church very Loosely because my.grandparents were both Catholic but my.mom never really a single mom never.really adhered to the Catholic faith but.she wanted to kind of do right what she.thought was right so she would take me.to church but she wasn't we weren't.faithful with it um I went to Catholic.school so so I I had a very I would say.surface level understanding of Jesus I I.was raised in the Catholic church I was.not raised in Christ if that makes sense.um so what happened to me was I after.after having an experience in Catholic.school going to high school got very.depressed I kind of always struggled.with isolation my whole life just being.as an only child who did not have a.foundation of Christ as the Bedrock of.my childhood um and I had a single mom.so I I never had a father which is.obviously God's design for for everybody.um now.I I I suffered with depression I would.say from seventh grade until 2021 when I.got saved and now I I mention that.because I I want people to understand.that grief and suffering and and pain.and Trauma and depression lead to New.Age more often than not and that's why I.would ER on the side of caution when I.when I hear things like you know we can.commune in a sense with our deceased.relatives um as long as they bring us.peace because my grandmother was.bringing me peace my uncle who had.committed suicide was bringing me peace.because and I thought that I could help.my mom you know grieve the loss of her.brother by helping her commune with him.things like that and and so I would just.ER on the side of caution encouraging.that of people um now I know they need.Jesus they don't need to talk to or try.and commune with or try and reconcile.anything with their deceased loved one.they need Christ because he heals the.broken wounds he's near to the.Brokenhearted and he resurrects Us in.New Life so anyway I was very depressed.is what I'm trying to say very depressed.all throughout new age I would get these.moments of Peace these these temporary.highs as I call them because all of new.AG is a spiritual narcotic and um it got.to a point where I was at the end of.myself in 2021 I was 27 years old at the.time I'm 29 now and I was on my kitchen.floor weeping and and I was I I was.talking out loud you know I I've done it.all I've done all the yoga every day I.do the rituals every day I meditate I.follow all the astrology I do all the.things I've read all the books you know.I have all these Spirit guides I I do.everything right you know I do.everything I'm supposed to I'm so.spiritual I'm so this I'm so that why do.I still come back to this why does it.always lead back to this this feeling of.just wanting to be dead and it was the.first time and you know Psalm says that.deep calls out to deep I called out to.Jesus I don't know where that came from.other than that he's written on all of.our hearts I called out to Jesus I said.Jesus save me and the next morning I.woke up and I was completely delivered.from depression and that was the.first time I recognized that the name of.Jesus Christ was different from.everything else that I had been doing.for 10 years because it was the first.real tangible difference like the.heaviness was gone and so that began.like a very short Journey it was about a.three or four month Journey where I had.the idea that I could be a new age.Christian essentially and I thought that.Jesus could just be another one of my.guides he could be in my tool belt of.spirituality oh I'll read the Bible you.know after I do yoga or you know I'll.I'll I'll do a crystal meditation but.this time I'll talk to Jesus when I do.it that's kind of the sort of mind that.I had because I wasn't ready to give.those things up I I hadn't repented um I.had just recognized that he was real and.so it got to a point you know I was.reading scripture and scripture did what.scripture does I I was I was faced with.Isaiah 47 where it speaks to the.astrologers how they cannot save.themselves and they cannot save you and.that they will burn and when I read that.it was the first time I felt Godly.sorrow I felt convict convicted of my.sin I recognized wow I'm a sinner.everything I've been doing not just the.past 10 years but really my whole life.was a rebellion against An Almighty God.that loves me and died for me and I.grieve him when I do these things and I.can't have both I can't partake of the.cup of the Lord and of the cup of demons.you know and I I obviously didn't know.that scripture then but that's what I.was that's what I was trying to do I was.trying to have both and we don't serve a.god of neutrality you know you're either.on the broad Road or you're on the.narrow road and I wanted to try and do.both but as soon as I read Isaiah 47 and.and the Holy Spirit came upon me I.repented and I called my best friend now.this is a part of my testimony I like.mentioning because for anyone watching.if you have any unsaved loved ones in.your life you got to be praying for them.you have to intercede for them my best.friend she was Christian our whole lives.I always thought she was lame and.judgmental but I loved her she prayed.for me.ceaselessly and she got to kind of see.the the the harvest of that of those.seeds that were planted and those.prayers that were petitioned before the.Lord all those years so please pray for.your lost loved ones they are not Out Of.Reach of the Lord nothing is impossible.for him we serve a a god of the.impossible and so I love mentioning that.because without you know her prayers.were the shield of faith and I really.see in hindsight how her prayers kept me.from a lot of a lot of things that I.always tried to do in new age but I.could never quite get there like other.people could and I really believe that.was her prayers you know interceding on.behalf of that but I called her when I.repented I was sobbing and I said I need.to stop I need to stop yoga I have to.stop teaching I have to stop doing Reiki.I have to stop astrology I'm going to.quit this podcast that I'm doing I don't.know what I'm doing I need to give my.life to God I had never read acts before.but I knew to burn everything so I.gathered all my tarot cards all my books.all my tapestries everything and went to.her house that night we had a bonfire.and I burnt all of it and what I.couldn't get rid of like you know camper.and crystals her dad was kind enough to.take them to some sort of dump and and.he just took them away from me but um.yeah that was that was the pivotal.turning point where I confess with my.mouth believe in my heart Jesus was Lord.a year later I finally got baptized um.and I've just been on I've really been.on fire for the Lord ever since it's.there's a long story within that where.my now husband he was agnostic he.actually got radically saved and then we.got married and now we're pregnant and.so the last year of Our Lives is.completely different than anything that.we had done together or apart for the.last 14 years that we've known each.other and it's all because of Jesus can.I just ask you you know there are a lot.of people who are listening or watching.right now and they may this may be so.foreign to them the idea of being saved.you know being a Christian or or maybe.they're desperate they're they're.looking for answers in some of the.places you were looking for them you.know a lot of people are trying to.they're going out looking for mediums.psychics and this is the time of year.again where this stuff is really kicked.up into high gear you know what would.you say to those people right now who.who are who are looking and they're.searching for an answer in your view for.what you believe their solution would be.you're going to keep looking it's a.labyrinth new age is a labyrinth it's I.always say it's a hamster wheel um.you're never going to to actually.achieve the enlightenment that you know.new age is so popular for talking about.you're never going to achieve.enlightenment because all of new age is.essentially a self- saavor complex and.it completely eliminates the need for.Jesus and so what you're trying to do in.new age is you're actually trying to.achieve being born again but you can't.because you're operating within the.deadness of your sin you're operating.within within within flesh that is going.to hell if you don't repent if you don't.put your faith in Christ and so it's.never going to work and a really popular.term in new age is you know my truth.every new Ager is on their journey of my.truth a lot of my old new age friends.are you know now say like I'm glad you.found your truth Angela but it's not.that I found my truth it's that I found.the truth Jesus says he is the way the.truth and the life and that that's.exactly what he is the new age is not.the way the new age is not the truth and.it is not the life it is a deception it.is it is a hamster wheel it is pseudos.spiritual and it's only going as I said.2 Corinthians 11:14 Satan masquerades as.an angel of Light new ages think they're.all full of light and love but you're.really full of of death and wickedness.and it doesn't have you recognize that.you're a sinner you don't you don't see.that when you're in New Age so you need.to recognize that what you're doing is.is actually.a sin against a perfectly holy God who.loves you so much that he sent his only.son stretched out his arms to die for.you to bleed for you to die for you.because he loved you so much that he.wanted to reconcile you back to himself.and what we're trying to do in new age.is always reconcile ourselves to our.higher self or to a higher state of.consciousness but Jesus is the one that.Rec that reconciles us back to the.father to the Creator and so I just.really encourage you to just call out to.Jesus and.and accept him as truth because he is.well I appreciate you sharing that.journey and we've moved to the point now.of the show we're actually at the end of.the show here where we're going to have.a couple of minutes here for just final.thoughts you know I know a lot of us.we're hearing things maybe that we agree.with that we disagree with or things.that we want to leave people with in.this conversation about Halloween about.evil about um how we even process some.of these complex ideas and and.theologies and so y Matt I'll come to.you first as we round out to a close.any final thoughts from you I think.Christ is.Victor that is the key Point Christ.descended into Hades preach the gospel.that they might receive the Holy Spirit.and be saved that Christ saves to the.uttermost okay so you know it all things.are being reconciled to God whether in.heaven on Earth or under the earth that.is Hebrew Greek Underworld the afterlife.basically and so we can know that Christ.has the keys of death and Hades that we.have that he is the way to the father.there are many ways to come to Christ.but he is the only way to the father we.don't have to amp it up uh we don't have.to pretend that it is anything bigger.than it is because Satan will take the.credit um Satan isn't omnipresent we.need to remember that um and that um.test.everything test absolutely everything.and you know for not all comes uh not.all spirits come from God but that means.that some do and if everything was a.demon then there is no test is there.there's no test required God doesn't.deal in absurdities with these things we.need to make sure that if we have.received some a.visitation uh then we to test it does it.bring about love joy peace patience.kindness goodness gentleness.faithfulness self-control against the.law against these there's no law okay we.can be conscious that maybe we can pray.for the dead because that's what the.breim Eucharist does um and deliverance.ministers who have prayed uh who have.performed the Eucharist at places find.that that is the ultimate place where.Rec conciliation takes place between.humans and God and so when we are having.disturbances get hold of somebody who.can deal with these things um and and.remember that we are dealers in truth so.we shouldn't be giving out information.that is false that is uh misleading that.bears false witness against our.neighbors whether they're a witch or um.a general Pagan or whatever the.information in tracks that we should.give out our Halloween should be truth.filled not full of mistakes and.misinformation because otherwise we're.know better than those who pedal.misinformation and we don't deserve to.be heard as uh when we have the message.of Christ Rey final thoughts from you.yeah I just like said in a way had me on.this program because Angela was so good.and what she said was so powerful I was.just entranced by the truth of what you.was saying so play this again listen to.her what she said about repentance and.coming to Jesus submitting to God.resisting the devil being born again.truly born again I love what she said.about her Christian friend was lame and.judgmental that's what we're leveled at.if we're Christians the world's going to.think we're lame and we're judgmental.but all we are are people who love.Sinners and we want to see them come to.everlasting life that's alone in.Jesus Angela you shared your story with.us there a little while go but as we.close out here you get the final word.yeah well thank you for letting me share.and thank you for um right and Matt for.having this conversation with us as well.um I just I kind of want to kind of.bring it back around the barn just to.the topic of Halloween CU I feel like we.all got really off track but that's okay.that's kind of what happens when we have.these conversations um I want to just.say you know we it's true that we are.Victors in Christ we are more than.conquerors in Christ Jesus and I I would.say that this speaks more to Christians.than it does I don't expect anyone of.the world to stop participating in.things of the world before they know.Christ um but but as Christians you know.the scriptures says like what whatever.is permissible is not necessarily.beneficial and so I would just encourage.you to take it to the Lord if if this is.a video you clicked because you're.having kind of maybe an internal battle.with this topic should I be celebrating.Halloween should I not be celebrating.Halloween take it to the Lord and as.I've mentioned many times throughout.this this this dialogue that you know.what does it look like to die to.yourself to to Really yield to the whole.Holy Spirit and to really crucify that.flesh um and again I I like that we we.mentioned Philippians 48 that comes to.mind when I when I with the topic of.Halloween as well as Galatians 5:13 you.know do not use your freedom as an.opportunity for the flesh we are free in.Christ and that is often What I Hear.most when it comes to Halloween like.we're free we're free we don't have to.be afraid and it's not about being.afraid it's about actually in my in my.worldview with with with the scripture.embodying that freedom we don't need to.do these things because we are free we.don't need to look like the world in.order to minister to the world we are.called to be set apart and not be.conformed but to be transformed by the.renewing of your mind and so if this is.you and you're having this this internal.conflict within yourself just take it to.the Lord I promise you that Holy Spirit.will tell you what he wants you to do.and and so I would just encourage you to.listen to him not even any of us well I.want to thank you all for joining me.today we've got to leave it there today.but thanks to my guest Angela Uchi Ray.comfort and Matt Arnold we hope you.enjoyed the discussion as always let us.know what you think about the show today.we can't wait to hear from you and until.next time.[Music].[Applause].[Music].goodbye.
