Free Will predestination excellent.question.wow I told you want to give you answers.you may not like you may like them now.let me tell you a little bit about my.journey and I don't want to offend any.of my brothers and sisters who may not.like that I've change I used to be a.fivepoint calvinist I used to be okay I.don't want to offend anyone who is I'm.no longer a.calvinist and I believe it's because the.weight of scripture made me change my.position I understand and I don't want.people are Calvinists that think I'm.saying that you're not Christians I'm.saying in my journey my understanding.I've changed so when you ask me about.predestination Free Will what exactly.are you asking me about predestination.are you asking me has God.predestined everything everyone does.within time and space are you asking me.salvation Salvation okay so even that.and I'm not trying to skirt the answer.because that question needs a little.unpacking are you asking me has God.predestined those who will be saved yes.and when you ask me that do you really.mean God has already chosen before.creation who will be saved and who.won't in other words God has created you.to be saved through faith in Christ but.he's created him to hand them over to.desires of his heart and then damn him.accordingly is that what you're asking.me pretty much all right if you read the.totality of scripture correct God truly.desires a Salvation of every human.creature right you can't get around that.see these were the things that as a.calvinist I struggled with I struggled.with I'll give you a couple examples so.we can be here all night talking about.this it's up to you guys because this is.a very and I'm treading lightly not.because I don't want to answer but it's.not a yes or no I have to unpack it yeah.I've been spending 50 years trying to.figure it out brother we're going to be.spending thousands of years still trying.to figure it out that's a you're not.believe me we're not going to figure it.out but I can tell you with absolute.certainty on the basis of scripture God.desires the salvation of even those who.end up rejecting him and going to hell.right and from the depth of his being he.desired their Salvation And I'm not.saying this because I want to tickle.people's ears if I was in a church.they're all Calvinists I would say the.same thing right and then You' have.those Calvinists would tell you well.that's the two Wills of God in certain.calvinist understanding God has two.Wills what he.decrees what he has determined and what.he desires he may desire the salvation.of everyone but he's only decreed the.salvation of the elect they call this.the two Wills in God you'll hear some.prominent calvinist mentioned this like.John Piper you John.Piper John MacArthur they talk about the.TOs of God what God desires and what.he's decreed so he desires the salvation.of a Judas but he's decreed the.damnation of.Judas and they go we don't understand.how it works now if that's biblical I'm.okay with not understanding how God.works but let me give you some passages.that trouble me that Jesus remember I.said he's the god of Truth he can't lie.because he can't lie he's not play.acting so go to Luke 1941 of.44 now here's where the King James Bible.will do you a favor in certain.passages and I'll tell you what I mean.in a minute Luke.1941-44 Luke.1941-44 excellent question excellent.question and this is going to be a.debate until the Lord comes because.we're dealing with an infinite mind and.how that infinite mind relates to.creation and time you get two Christians.you're going to get 50,000 opinions.because you're dealing with an infinite.mind right I mean imagine you want to.take an entire body of water and put it.in this cup is that going to be.possible right so you are that cup and.God is that huge ocean you trying to fit.them in your brain ain't going to happen.his ways are higher than our ways so.it's not.that God doesn't want you to understand.even if he wanted you there are certain.things God cannot do and that's not.irreverent there are certain things God.cannot do he cannot lie right he cannot.disown himself right he cannot tempt you.with evil so God cannot take a finite.creature and make him infinite doesn't.happen right so even if God wanted you.you you're a creature by your very.nature you're limited and you cannot.contain the infinite and even that he's.defining but anyway Luke.1941-44 Luke.1941-44 notice the Heart of Jesus.towards Jerusalem that he's now going to.allow to be destroyed by the Romans.notice his heart whoever wants to read.it Luke 1941-44 and when he was come.near he beheld the City Jerusalem and.wept over it saying he wept huh yeah so.now before you move on you got to read.it slowly so it can simmer was he play.acting or these genuine tears from his.heart of course you're going to say.because to say he's play that's.blasphemy so here is the human face of.God shedding human tears because his.heart is broken but why is his heart.broken keep reading saying if thou Hast.known even thou at least in this thy day.the things which belong unto thy peace.but now they are HID from thine eyes for.the day shall come upon thee th thine.enemies shall cast a trench about thee.Encompass thee round and keep thee in on.every side and shall lay thee even with.the ground and thy children with thee.and they shall not leave in thee one.stone upon another because thou knewest.not the time of thy visitation now.notice two factors here first he says if.you only knew what made for you peace so.Jesus came to destroy or to grant them.peace came to gr them peace grant them.peace right and then 44 he says but.you've left me no choice and the time is.coming your enemies will embank make an.embankment around you dash you and.children to the ground and leave not one.stone upon another because you did not.recognize the time of your visitation.what in the world does that mean well.you don't need to guess Luke has already.told you what it means visitation go to.Luke Luke 1 and read.67-69 and pay attention to verse 68 Luke.1.67-69 what does it mean the time of your.visitation Luke will explain this is the.beauty of scripture the author will.explain the things he's written by.inspiration of the holy spirit so you.don't need to guess you don't need Sam.shimon's commentary but if I do write a.commentary I expect every one of you to.buy multiple.copies no Luke 1.67-69 whoever is there please.read his father Zechariah was filled.with the holy spirit so understand this.is the utterance from the Holy Spirit.right it's why I had you start at 67.Zechariah filled the holy spirit so it's.the Holy Spirit who's moving him to.utter these words these are the words.holy spirit is moving Zechariah to utter.it's not his fallible imperfect opinion.okay just keep that in mind keep reading.praise be to the Lord the god of Israel.because he has come and has redeemed his.people he has raised up a horn.did not translate visited.he the Lord God of Israel for he has.visited redeemed his people what.translation are you reading um the NIV.the not inspired version notp.also.Eng now uh ni work your way away from.the NIV.okay I'm being honest say it again it's.got all my markings yeah that's yeah but.that's the whole problem see one thing a.translation is not just a translation is.an interpretation at times you need to.interpret not just translate literally.because if I translate literally you're.going to lose the meaning but there are.times in which NIV has translated in a.way that's more of a paraphrase that was.unnecessary for example when your.translation said the Lord God has come.you didn't see any connection between.what was said there and with what Jesus.said so you lost the connection unless.you're reading it in the Greek right but.that's why you want a translation so you.don't go to the original languages CU.they need to go to Seminary and you know.be in debt up to your eyeballs to learn.the languages so notice his translation.read it one more time Luke 168 blessed.be the Lord God of Israel for he has.visited and redeemed his people so why.did the Lord God visit his people to do.what destroy them or redeem them to.redeem them so when Jesus said you did.not recognize the time of your.visitation what is he referring to that.I'm the Lord God who was come to visit.you to save you see the connection so.what was Jesus's desire to save.Jerusalem and all her inhabitants but.because you rejected me now you've left.me no choice but allow you to be.destroyed this is why the wording is.important so what is the time of.visitation Jesus that God has come to.visit his people with salvation not.destruction so why did you end up.destroying them because they refused to.accept me so was wasn't your will to.destroy them no my will was to save.every one of them so why did they end up.D because they rejected.me you see where I'm going with this so.free will we'll get there so far yes no.we'll get yeah no and again yes uh I'll.explain how the Bible works it just you.remember like I said the the question he.asked me I can't answer in one minute I.can't answer if you really want me to do.justice to this question I got to unfold.it right in fact it would even take.series of lessons not just one or two.I'm going to do my best with the four.and a half hours a lot of I'm kidding.anyway now that was 168 but now go to.169 reading your translation continue.169 and he raised up a horn of salvation.for us in the house of his servant David.horn is a metaphor in the Bible.referring to a King with Sovereign power.he's raised up a king from whose.house David to do.what salvation who is that King from the.House of David that's come to save Jesus.right that's why I go to read Luke 2.2:11 see Jesus they don't stop.texting but anyway it happens Luke when.you're on social media you won't get.down but Luke 2:11 who is the horn the.king from the House of David that comes.to save not destroy comes to save not.condemn Luke 2:11 For unto you is Born.This Day in the city of David a savior.who is Christ the lord so God sent his.son to be born of the seed of David to.destroy Jerusalem or to save him save.salvation you see why Jesus was crying.now do you see his heart he started.weeping cuz I had come to save you but.because you didn't recognize who I am.but oppose me you leave me no choice but.give you what you deserve so this is the.heart of God this is God's heart for.even those who were destroyed his heart.was I didn't come to destroy you I came.to save you so the Lord did everything.in his power and goodness to convince.them they persisted in their Rebellion.leaving him no choice but to hand them.over justifiably so to destruction but.to make it even more plainer that he.came to save them that was his desire.same chapter Luke Luke 1:.76-77 read what it says.there now zechariah's prophesying over.his son John the Baptist because John.the Baptist is more the Forerunner of.Jesus so now he's going to prophesy over.his son John you John my son you were.created for this purpose for what.purpose.read and you child will be called the.prophet of the most high for you will go.before the Lord to prepare his ways to.give acknowledge of Salvation to his.people and the Forgiveness of their sins.so what is he going to tell the people.the Savior has come and he's come to SA.save you from your sins by believing in.him and who's the Savior Jesus Christ so.it's quite clear in the context of Luke.the intention and the purpose of Jesus.was to save Jerusalem as a whole.everyone even those that end up getting.destroyed now let me shock you a little.further Jesus also came to save.Judas now some of you not shot good.because a lot of people get shot what.yeah okay let me show you what Jesus.says to Judas you who follow me will sit.on 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of.Israel does that include.Judas could have been but Jesus knew.Judas would betray him and Jus Jesus.knew that Judas would be destroyed.however though Jesus knew it Jesus is.showing his intention and his heart my.heart for you Judas is salvation not.destruction and I have all this in store.for you if you only.believe let me give you a couple more go.to Matthew 10 veres 1 all the way to 8.Matthew 10: 1 to8 I want you to see Not.only was Judas promised a throne Judas.was given the same power to do the same.Miracles that the others did Judas like.the rest raised the dead Judas like the.rest gave sight to the blind Judas like.the rest cast out demons Judas like the.rest preached the gospel and got people.saved it's right there Matthew 10: 1 to8.you'll see.it and he called to him his 12 disciples.and gave them authority over un clean.Spirits 11 of.disciples no all 12 Judas too yeah H.interesting keep going to cast them out.and to heal every disease and every.Affliction the names of the twel.Apostles are these first Simon who was.called Peter and Andrew his brother.James the son of Zebedee and John his.brother Philip and Bartholomew Thomas.and Matthew the tax collector James the.son of alaus and Thaddius Simon the.Zealot and Judas es scariot who betrayed.him so even Judas huh yeah and so what.did Judas do keep reading all the way to.these 12 these 12 Jesus sent out.instructing them go nowhere among the.Gentiles and enter no town of the.Samaritans but go rather to the lost.sheep of the House of Israel and.Proclaim as you go saying the Kingdom of.Heaven is at hand heal the sick raise.the dead cleanse the leopards cast out.Jud is going to you're reading like.you're you're really fast like you want.to get raptured and leave us behind.don't worry about no there's Rapture all.going together for saved so no rush.slowly what is Judas going to do heal.what heal the sick raise the dead so.Judas was going to raise the dead yeah.someone whom the Lord knew would betray.him who belong to the devil keep reading.cleanse lepers cast out.demons you received without paying give.without paying H so Judas was given the.same authority to do the same Miracles.and was given the same promise to Reign.Over Israel that the rest were right.it's going to get a little better or.worse depending on your theological.belief go to Luke 10 17 to 20 72.returned with Joy saying Lord even the.demons are subject to us in your now.does that include Judas or no that would.include Judas right all right keep going.and he said to them I saw Satan fall.like lightning from Heaven behold I have.given you authority to tread oh serpents.and scorpions and on all and over all.the power of the enemy and nothing shall.hurt you nevertheless do not rejoice in.this that the spirits are subject to you.but Rejoice that your names are written.in heaven okay whose names are written.in.heaven whose names are written in.heaven 72 that went out okay Judas went.went out too yes sir so his name is.written in heaven.I never thought it before exactly I mean.and I say that because clearly Jesus is.showing his intention for Judas you will.sit on one of the 12 Thrones I've given.you power over demons they are subject.to you and your name is written in.heaven see in the Bible names are.erased in other words if you read the.Bible contextually which I'm about to do.every human creature that exists his.name is written it's when a person falls.away that the names are erased go to.Revelation.3:5 the one who conquers will be clothed.thus in white garments and I will never.blot his name out of the book that's a.promise to who the one who conquers.right so that if you conquer not only.you'll be given a right Ro but I won't.blot out your.name therefore if you fail to conquer.what.happens you don't need to guess go to.Exodus 32 32-33 where God makes it.explicit Exodus 32:.32-33 yet now if thou wil forgive their.sin and if not blot me I pray thee out.of thy book which thou Hast written and.the Lord said unto Moses whoever hath.sinned against me him will I blot out of.my book so you caught it he blots out.those who sin and turn away so if I read.contextually judas's name is in the book.Judas is one of those who sit on one of.the 12 Thrones and Judas is given power.to cast out demons raised the Dead all.of which displays Jesus's genuine love.for Judas but it's going to get even.more explicit in Luke 22.19-23 Luke 22.19-23 and he took bread and gave thanks.and break it and gave unto them saying.this is my body which is given for you.this do in remembrance of me likewise.also the cup after supper saying this.cup is the New Testament in my blood.which is shed for you now before you.move on does he exclude anyone in what.he just said this bread is my body.broken for you does he say some of you.most of you but not all of you and then.in verse 20 one more.time this cup is the New Testament in my.blood which is shed for you some of you.most of you but not all of you all of.you but now notice who's included Now.read 21 and 23 but behold the hand of.him that betrayeth me is with me on the.table and truly the son of man goeth as.it was determined but woe unto that man.by whom he is betrayed so when Jesus.said this bread represents my body.broken for all of you and this cup is.the new cup of my blood shed for you was.Judas there of course and he included.Judas in that saying so Jesus saying to.Judas I'm even dying for you and this is.how you repay.me now one more final passage on this.Psalm 69.27-28 Psalm 69 27-28 add to them.punishment upon punishment may they have.no acquittal from you let them be.blotted out of the book of The Living.let them not be enrolled among the.righteous so there you go it's blotting.out those whose names are in and why are.they being blotted.out why are the names being blotted.out they're not considered because of.they're persistent rebellion and.rejecting the truth right so why did I.bring up Judas because Judas represents.Jesus's heart for all of Jerusalem and.not just for all of Jerusalem but all.creation that God's desire is to save.every creature that he's created and God.has done everything to show his love for.every creature but when someone persists.in rebellion and turns away then God is.Justified in handing him over to.destruction so when I used to be a.calvinist I used to believe this was my.teaching what I was taught because there.are varieties of Calvinism you have some.Calvinists who are fourpoint Calvinists.and then you have Calvinists who believe.there are two Wills in God I was one of.those taught that Jesus only died for.the elect no more no.less that's all he died for and he came.to save only the elect no more no less.and the elect will then be regenerated.by the spirit and enabled to Believe In.Christ so that Those whom Jesus dies for.will be saved because they'll definitely.turn to Christ this is what I was taught.it's these passages that made me start.questioning first limited atonement then.it started making me question.what we call irresistible Grace and then.it started making me question see I was.told that if you reject one link it's.inevitable you're going to reject all of.them I didn't think so I said I'll be.okay I can reject limit atement I'll.still believe but the more I started.thinking about it I go yeah they're.right when one goes they all go now this.is my journey this may not be your.journey this is my journey but when they.keep talk because I've already I used to.argue these arguments I already know.where they're coming from I know about.acts one and mitias I know they're GNA.say well Jesus had Mias in mind.what Jesus had in mind and what his.audience understood it's two different.things and you can't reject the.contextual meaning what Jesus is.conveying to those people on the basis.of the missions of Christ because then.we can play that game all day all night.with many passages of the Bible many one.classic text that I use as as a ground.to see if people are thinking.exegetically or.istically I have them explain to me John.3:5 and I want to give this as an.example because I know where the.brothers were coming from and I was.trying to address it without trying to.be argumentative but sometimes you can't.avoid it you have to argue but that's.okay sharpen iron sharpens iron now in.john 35 this will be a test of our.ability to think exegetically or isog.where we impose a tradition onto the.text or let the text speak clearly in.its historical contextual context you.have to first understand what a passage.means in its own context and see how.applies later on you have to do this.otherwise you're making the Bible fit.your theology as opposed to changing.your theology degree at the Bible and.we're all guilty of that to some extent.I'm guilty of it when I say the prayer.should be holy spirit sanctify me show.me where I'm wrong right because I don't.think there's anyone on this side of.Glory that understands the Bible.perfectly and is not reading the Bible.istically in some extent we all do it to.some extent sadly we're not aware of it.because if we were we wouldn't do it.right right if I knew I'm isting it you.think I want to ISO unless I'm of the.devil because that's what Satan does he.isoetes and he does it knowingly and.willfully okay so this is going to be a.test how you read the Bible if you read.it fairly historically contextually to.see what these words meant to the people.that Jesus is talking to and don't brush.it aside to omniscience that's not going.to work because Jesus is trying to.communicate clearly to the people.hearing him.and then we see how it applies to us.later on John 3:5 after Nicodemus is.baffled when Jesus says You must be born.again he says truly truly I say to you.in verse five what does it say Lord.wants to read it except a man be born of.water and of the spirit he cannot enter.into the kingdom of God this will be a.test of whether you isog or you ex what.does it mean water in spirit now I can.give you the interpretations given.historically here water means the water.of the word then when you hear the word.it cleanses you and some will go to John.15:3 you're already clean because of the.word I've spoken to you or in Ephesians.5:26 the washing of the water of the.word Ephesians 5:26 okay that's one.interpretation the other interpretation.is that it's referring to natural birth.the water of the womb why because in.verse four what does he say must I enter.my mother's womb a second time so he.understood it to mean natural birth but.then in verse six Jesus says flesh gives.birth to flesh right spir so a see.natural birth okay that's the second.meaning the third meaning is that when.it says water and spirit that word and.gets a little tricky in the Greek and.get any commentary to confirm this the.word n doesn't always mean an it can.mean even the water even the spirit.meaning the water that is the spirit so.that water here means the spirit it's.simply two ways of speaking of being.born of the spirit now where do they get.that from CU in John 738 to 39 in John 7.38-39 Jesus says whoever believes in me.as the scripture says out of his belly.will flow rivers of Living Water and.then 39 John says of this he spake of.the spirit so you see water that is the.spirit now there's a fourth.interpretation water baptism and the.Holy.Spirit those are the four.interpretations contextually what.interpretation makes sense of the.context historically.if you tell me water here means being.cleansed by the word you'd have to show.me Nicodemus understood it because Jesus.is trying to make it clear to Nicodemus.you must be born again don't pass it off.on God's omniscience because Jesus is.trying to tell him this is what you must.do to then not explain how to do it.means he's left in the dark about how to.be born.again so what he have understood it to.mean the water of the word how Jesus.never mentioned anything about the word.cleansing you.right right okay the strongest the I.would say the second strong is natural.birth why because before and after he.talks about birth right right okay but.I'm going to show you one that's even.stronger and this is the unanimous.interpretation of the early Church by.the way let me shock some of you if you.go and read the writings of the church.fathers don't take my word for it please.do not take my word for it do not thank.God for Chef Google Google the greatest.scholar was ever existed google.com.we'll get all the answers on Google the.greatest living scholar of the 21st.century you type in John 3:5 early.church fathers you will find from the.Epistle of Barnabas to arenus to Justin.Martyr and on and on it goes every one.of them when they spoke about John 3:5.they understood water to mean water.baptism without exception I'm going to.tell you why that's important in a.minute I'll tell you that why it's.important in a minute but let's go.contextually.how many of you aware that Jesus used to.baptize people in.water before his death and.Resurrection how many of you aware that.Jesus actually had his disciples.immersed people in water in a body of.water where do we find.that right here right after he finishes.telling Nicodemus you must be born of.water and spirit because notice in verse.22 after he finishes the conversation.what does Jesus.do chapter 7 or 8 no John 3:22 oh I'm.sorry right after he says You must be.born of water and spirit the only gospel.writer to mention Jesus started.baptizing people in water.coincidence John 3:22 someone read it.for me after these things came Jesus and.his disciples into the land of Judea and.there he carried with them and.baptized he baptized huh and just so you.don't have any doubt it's water they go.to John the Baptist if you continue.reading they go to John hey the man that.you're talking.everyone's going to him to be.baptized and that's when John says well.I'm just the friend he is the bridegroom.he must increase I must decrease and.then you still don't get that Jesus is.baptizing people read 26.26 and they came unto John and said unto.him Rabbi he that was with thee Beyond.Jordan to him thou bearest witness.behold the same baptizeth and all men.come to him and if they're talking to.John who's baptizing water guess what.kind of baptism Jesus is doing in water.water baptism and if you still don't get.it John 4: 1-.2 when therefore the Lord knew how the.Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and.baptized more disciples than John though.Jesus himself baptized not but his.disciples through the agency of the.disciples so is it a coincidence after.telling Nicodemus you must be born of.water and spirit he starts baptizing.people in water through the agency of.his disciples or is John the author.wants you to make a connection and see.Jesus's.meaning see if you if you are stuck to a.tradition you're going to read it isog.no it can't mean water baptism because.my tradition says water baptism doesn't.regenerate well that's good for your.tradition I'm dealing with ex Jesus my.allegiance isn't to your tradition it's.to interpreting the Bible correctly so.convince me exegetically that it's not.water baptism historically contextually.exegetically but I agree with you but.I've heard people say what about the.thief that was on the Christ on the the.cross and he says today you will be with.me inair I actually did a session.because let's think logically do you.really expect someone who's got spikes.in his hands to then someone say hey get.him off right now and dip him in water.dude or he's not going to heaven that's.right exactly that is one of the worst.examples of because Jesus Christ who's.God can grant anyone's salvation any.manner he he sees fitre you're talking.about an exceptional case someone who.not only didn't get baptized who didn't.even go to church who didn't study the.Bible who didn't take.communion so is he the norm is that the.person we look to as the normal way of.doing things or is that an exception to.show you that the grace of God Is So.vast that he can even save you in the.last seconds of your life but ask me a.better question what if that man.survived would he have then been.obligated to get.baptized based to what you're showing us.yes it has to be because what did the.Lord say the Great commission go and.make disciples of all Nations baptizing.them into the name of the father son.holy spirit so would he have been a good.Christian and good standing if he.survived the crucifixion and went on his.merry way and didn't get.baptized see this is another thing we.take what are exceptions to the norm and.ignore ignore the normal way of doing.things and I can like I said I can do.this with any example Hebrews 9:27 were.told it is appointed for men to die once.and after that comes a judgment.but then Hebrews 11:5 says Enoch didn't.die well hold on Hebrews you told me.it's appointed for men to die once Enoch.didn't die Lazarus died was raised to.die again that's twice so come on get.your facts straight.Hebrews you you with me there you don't.look at the exceptions and then derive.your Doctrine you look at the norm right.the normal pattern of how God deals with.people and that's how you derive your.Doctrine.because if we go with exceptions I can.do that with essentially every doctrine.that you take for granted I can look to.those scanty references out of context.in isolation and dis prove many things.you believe I can do that with the DD of.Christ I can do that with the Trinity I.I mean I we there's no stopping this.method this is why I said John 3:5 will.be a test study of whether you ex or you.is but someone had their hand raised.yeah so so uh Matthew Matthew.7:21 uh not everyone says to me Lord.Lord shall enter the king of heaven but.those who do the will of my fathers in.heaven yes precisely he was referring to.Judas one as one yes because Judas did.Miracles Judas cast out demons right he.did everything Jesus said those people.would do but one thing Judas did not do.he did not obey the commands of the Lord.and how does it apply to today so far.yeah you have you can have people who.can preach like me now I don't raise the.dead yet I don't know but maybe we can.try maybe someone you you want to be.maybe you Dro.in I can be preaching all day all night.but if I'm not striving to live and.obedience to the will of God then I a.Judas because Jesus tells you how you.know a true Christian from a false one.it's right there in Matthew 7:23 I will.tell them.plainly I never knew you depart from me.you Lawless.ones now the word is interesting it's.anoman it means without law a negation.noos meaning you who rejected my law see.we don't emphasize enough in the church.and we don't I I'm not attacking I'm.just being honest the necessity to.obedience to God's law amen people will.tell you well Moses gave the law Jesus.gave Grace you know I'm saved by grace.not by law well that confuses two issues.they weren't saved by law either in the.Old Testament no one was saved by the.law they were saved by grace and in the.New Testament though you're saved by.Grace you're saved unto obedience to the.law of Christ you have a law that you're.supposed to obey it's called The Law of.Christ go to 1 Corinthians.9:21 so I didn't mean to go a far drift.I didn't do justice to the answer about.predestination but I did want to.emphasize however whatever view you have.predestination you cannot deny God's.heart that he wants to save every.creature in existence and I'm going to.go back to one more passage to really.you think this is controversial if I go.to this passage you guys are going to.start stoning me these two brothers are.about to headbutt me when I'm done.they're going to start stoning me get.them out of here this guy man Alex.you're you're disfellowship but the will.of the father is that everyone would.know him therefore responsibility.according to his La is to go out and.tell everyone you have to I'll prove.that to you that God's will because you.can't have Jesus's will in conflict with.the father's will or in conflict with.the spirit then you don't have a trinity.you have three separate gods in Conflict.the father's will is in perfect union.with the son's will and the spirit's.will that's why if you remember what he.said about the spirit let me remind you.what he said about the spirit he will.not speak on his own initiative he'll.only speak what he hears that was John.16:13 the members of the godhead are in.perfect Inseparable.Union they always do all things in.perfect union they're never in.competition or opposition so if it's.Jesus's will for Judas to be saved guess.whose will that was as well father the.father and the spirit unless there's a.conflict of will within the godhead when.then you destroy the Integrity of the.god got it and I don't think anyone.wants to go that far but let's just read.1 Corinthians.9:21 want read to those outside the law.I became as one outside the law not.being outside the law of God but under.the law of Christ so we do have a law.it's called The Law of Christ and that's.in Galatians 6 verse2 by the way.Galatians.6:2 so you Christians have been saved to.obedience to the law of Christ well what.is that love that's why I have 27 books.of.instruction Galatians.6:2 bear ye one another's burdens and so.fulfill the law of Christ so Christians.Grace doesn't exclude or do away with.the law Grace results in the empowerment.to obey the.law the law of Christ and if you ask me.what it is that's why you have 27 books.of instruction That's the Law of Christ.so what's the Criterion that Jesus gives.there to know a true Christian or a.false one are you obeying the law what.law not the Mosaic law the law of Christ.and his fulfillment of the Mosaic.law right no I'm I'm just giving you.scripture here right are you saying it.so that's the Criterion but now as far.as predestination and I don't want to.keep Bel laboring it because I want to.give people opportunity uh because again.I can be here all day on predestination.this this is why I'm trying to know how.much to say in a way that will put you.on a journey to think more deeply about.the about the.subject it you see irrefutable proof God.wants Every Creature to be saved now I'm.going to show you a passage I actually.debated a colleague of mine Matt slick.he's a fivepoint calvinist I love him.he's a dear brother in the Lord we.debate on limited TOS online got heated.because he's like me you know you know.when you're a calvinist and you're.Middle Eastern then you really got.issues because then you're super angry.right.I'm kidding with you but anyway we we it.got heated but it was respectful because.I really love Matt sck I consider him a.brother in the Lord I know he's not too.glad that I left Calvinism well we.debated on limited atonement we debated.on the topic I'll let you watch the.debate and you come to your own.conclusion I brought up Colossians 1 and.one thing I did not like is how they try.to manipulate my ex aesus in order to.portray me in a very unfavorable light.and that's what often we do we vilify.the other in order to get people not to.consider what the person's saying and.that's satanic by the way when I vilify.you in order to get someone not to.listen to you that means I'm being.satanic maybe that's not my intention.but it's simply not the way to do things.if someone is a brother in the Lord you.out of Grace need to give him the.benefit of the doubt and see him in the.most favorable manner until he's done.something that makes him blameworthy.so if you don't consider your brother.that's okay you can attack me but if you.I'm saying you gener I'm not saying.anyone does but if you think that this.man is a brother in the Lord I disagree.with him but I'm not going to vilify him.in order to make him look as evil as.possible in order for you not to get to.hear what he has to say because that's.truly of the devil that's what the devil.does someone who's a Believer and.someone else that you recognize as a.Believer you hear him out this why I.kept telling Brothers Listen more than.you speak cuz let me make my point let.me finish before I finish listen see.when I want to hear another position I.listen I don't I start listen and I hear.I process it then I have questions okay.well hold on you said this well what.about this but if I don't think he's a.brother I'm going for the.jugler if you're a Muslim or Jo witness.I'm not asking you to learn I'm asking.to decimate.you because you're a false agent aul of.the devil but if you're a Christian I'll.hear you out go ahead brother.okay yeah all right that's that's my.policy that is my policy if I consider.you a Christian I'll hear you out if I.think you're a tool of the devil I will.decimate you because it's not me now I'm.now worried about the.flock you're a wolf and you're sent by.the devil to Devour the flock and if I'm.a mature Christian and I hope I am it's.my duty to love my Brethren to protect.them from you see that's a different.attitude right but now with that said.someone read that passage you're smiling.at me because I consider your brother H.which verse First.Corinthians Colossians yeah it was.Colossians chapter one like the way you.laid that out yeah yeah no because.that's what it is Colossians 1 now you.guys if you if you have Stones please.put them in the in your trunk so give me.at least five minutes to run because I'm.going to leave the state okay Colossians.1 this is what when Matt slick who's my.brother in the Lord he did something.that I thought he shouldn't have done he.tried to vilify me and it didn't work.though you can listen to the debate he.tried to vilify me and I said Matt.you're misrepresenting me guy listen to.what I'm saying carefully and this is a.passage that's a nightmare for those who.believe in limited tement if you believe.Christ only died for the elect this is.your nightmare passage this is what.messed me up one of many this one was a.chief one this one I would keep reading.over it and reading over it and I.wrestled because I was convinced the.Five Points of Calvinism must be.biblical in any passage it doesn't agree.I'm Mis interpreting it see it wasn't.maybe the system is wrong no it's the.explanation of this verse that's wrong.because the system is.airtight but then the Lord released me.that's why I don't subscribe to a.system I'll let the Bible speak and if.something that you believe doesn't agree.I'll say brother okay you believe that.God bless you I I can't accept it I.can't accept it you want to accept.that's okay I can't accept it I may be.wrong I may not be able to see what.you're seeing pray for me to get to that.point but if you're wrong may the Lord.show.you right I mean if you think you're.right obviously you don't believe.something because you think you're wrong.but you may be wrong and not know it so.this is why I began the session I'm.going to emphasize like a broken record.seek the Holy Spirit please show me.where I am wrong please guide me and.break my pride if I'm not willing to.give up because that's what I did I came.Kicking and Screaming I did not want to.give up on Calvinism no no and the Holy.Spirit said yes yes and who do you think.is stronger me or the Holy Spirit and he.brought me to my knees but go to.Colossians 1 let's read 13 to 17 now get.ready if you do believe in limit.atonement get ready and if you believe.that Christ died for everyone get ready.to be troubled get ready to be troubled.I'm letting you know so if you're.troubled I told you right so don't get.upset at me Colossians 1 13- 17 he has.delivered us from the Dominion of.darkness and transferred us to the.kingdom of his beloved Son in whom we.have Redemption the Forgiveness of sins.he is the image of the invisible God the.firstborn of all creation for by him all.things were created in heaven and on.Earth pause for a second my brother.would anyone deny when it says by Christ.all things were created on Heaven and.Earth that means every creature.everything now if you want to go the.rout of Joe witness and insert the word.other that's what they do in their.translation all other things yeah they.can have Jesus creating everything in.Heaven and Earth so now get I'm smiling.because I know where this is going to go.oh.boy everything in heaven that means.Angels Satan any it goes on dominions.and right clear right all right keep.reading in heaven and on Earth visible.and in invisible whether Thrones or.dominions or rulers or authorities all.things were created through him and for.him and he is before all things and in.him all things hold together now clear.as day all things in Heaven and Earth.means the entire creation no one is.excluded right even spiritual Powers.because it says dominions principalities.authorities right all right if you if.it's clear as day now read read 18 and.20 and notice the second half of what.many believe is a hymn actually if you.read commentaries they'll tell you they.think that Paul is actually citing an.early Christian hymn that it's a hymn.that Paul Incorporated by inspiration of.the Holy Spirit that's what some believe.we don't know for sure but that's a.belief there are several statements in.Paul that people think are hymns of the.church this is one the other is.Philippians 25-1 it's called kmen.Christie a himym to Christ where it says.who being in very nature God do not.consider equality God something to.exploit but made himself Nothing by.taking on the form of a slave Etc some.think that's also a himym that Paul.Incorporated whether it's a him or not.still it reflects what Paul and the.church has believed right now notice the.second part 18 to.20 and he is the.head uh of the body the church he is the.beginning and the first born from the.dead that is in everything he might be.preeminent okay for in him all the.fullness of God was pleased to dwell in.through him to reconcile to himself all.things whether on Earth or in heaven.Making Peace by the blood of the Cross.uhoh did the light switch go on for.anyone verse.20 Jesus made Peace by the blood of the.cross for who all things all all things.where in Heaven and Earth on Earth and.where up and down on Earth and.where but that's parallel to 16 right.all things that he created in Heaven and.Earth he's now procured the Redemption.of everything he created in Heaven and.Earth that's the.parallel I know it's not true but.there's some people out there professing.to be Christians that take this.scripture universalism and say because.of what he did he di for everybody.therefore everybody will be in heaven.now just two comments I would say number.one I know it's not true yeah well.number one I'm not a Universalist but.remember you're already adamant it can't.be true and you even question their.Christianity could they be wrong and.still be.Christians cuz the way you I don't I.don't know yeah but the way you stated.it they profess to be Christian meaning.you don't think they.are I think their theology puts some.questions out there if perfect the is a.prerequisite you and me will be the.first in hell we're all going to hell I.agree we can be gracious and say you're.wrong but you're a brother in Christ.because this is not one of those.doctrines that will damn you right I.mean I don't think your view of the.afterlife whether hell is forever or.it's a short period of time and then.it's remedial God will then cure you or.wipe you out we can disagree without.assuming that the person who disagrees.with me he's the one going to help maybe.right you're going to end up in hell.right it's possibility sure but just.like You' want him to hope that you're.going to heaven wish that for him right.do unto others as you'd have them do.unto you right yeah wish that unto him.Lord if he's wrong I'm right have mercy.on him if I'm wrong he's right have.mercy on me see there are some issues.worth fighting over I don't think these.are one of them that I would go to blows.with now if you tell me Jesus isn't God.get me a snow and give me a baseball.bat I understand where you're.going where does repentance if.universalism is where a person's.theology is yes then there's really no.need for repentance well they're saying.those for that matter obedience yeah.that's not their position their position.is if you've died rejecting Christ.that's why you will go to hell because.that's where you will be punished for in.Repentance but the purpose is not to.wipe you out or to prolong your judg is.to purge you and purify you of your evil.so that now you enter Heaven and are.grateful for what Jesus.did so they say that's what hell is.there for for the person who refus to.turn to Christ right so again I'm not.making a case for universalis I'm not a.Universalist well what I'm saying.is the first to present his case seems.right until and his neighbor comes and.questions him you've heard criticisms of.their view but have you ever sat and.listened to someone make a case for.their View and then decided whether.they're wrong right you see the point.yes let me give you another verse that.goes with this and don't lose your place.in Colossians keep there because if we.didn't finish Colossians got it go to.Proverbs.18:13 see with me if someone's a.trinitarian who loves and worships the.tri in God and believe Jesus is the god.man that he's born of the Virgin Mary he.died physically for our sins was raised.physically will return physically and.bodily and believes the Bible is God's.perfect word.that is enough for me to consider my.brother and sister in Christ everything.else we can agree to disagree and fight.over right that's me just me I'm not God.God could say I could care less for your.opinion but that's just me if you're an.anti-trinitarian no no we're going to.debate until you.repent that's not going to happen no no.Jesus is no created Archangel Michael.that Jesus can't save anyone but.Proverbs 1813 is another passage we need.to put take to heart someone read that.for me.he that answer a matter before he.heareth it it is folly and shame unto.him so when you rush to judgment to.answer before hearing it out thoroughly.what did the text say you're being and.I'm not saying you you you're being.stupid and.foolish right so you see this is wisdom.from God don't rush to judge don't speak.before you've heard something thoroughly.and don't settle for the first opinion.cuz the first to present his case seems.right until his neighbor comes and.questions him that was the same chapter.verse 17 so now coming back to.Colossians 1 let's go back to Colossians.1 now let's read 16 and 17.Again for by him all things were created.in heaven and on Earth visible and.invisible whether Thrones or dominions.or rulers or authorities all things were.created through him and for him and he.is before all things and in him all.things hold Now read verse.20 and through him to reconcile to.himself all things whether on Earth or.in heaven Making Peace by the blood of.his cross so in verse 16 all things in.Heaven and Earth means the entire.creation without exception so that Jesus.cre everything in heaven on Earth.without exception correct but then how.do you then avoid the implication of.verse 20 he also procured the Redemption.of all things on earth and in.heaven who's Exempted from the work of.his.Redemption nobody well those that.rejected yes but not not talking about.at application okay all right Redemption.accomplish is it's not the same thing as.Redemption applied right you know what.I'm saying when he accomplished.Redemption who did he accomplish it for.everybody everyone right yes so then how.can limited atonement be true that he.only died for the.elect good point right now how did I get.vilified in the debate to make me look.bad let me tell you you can watch the.debate oh so you're saying he died for.Satan I said Mt number one if it means.everything means everything so if it.means Satan yes but Satan will not be.saved because he won't believe because.there's a condition You Must Believe to.receive but you see he poisoned the well.to make my position look so Blasphemous.so people wouldn't hear me out when I.was just being exegetical I said just.read it I go explain to me who the.everyone he couldn't do it go listen he.couldn't do it so he resorted to what I.call and he I'm not saying he did it.deliberately he's a brother in the Lord.but he's so passionate about this.tradition he ended up vilifying me out.of emotional response he did and I don't.hold it against them I understand when.you are invested emotionally it's very.hard to let something go so he the.calvinist had a field day oh Sam shimun.says Satan's GNA be.saved that's what they said and that's.not what I said I said Matt the text.exegetically if all things in Heaven and.Earth you have no problem knitting Jesus.created it then deal with the.parallel all things on earth and in.heaven he has redeemed and made peace.with the blood of his cross so then sat.will be saved no because accomplishing.Redemption is not the same thing as.applying it because there's a condition.You Must Believe to receive he made it.available to all you got it but the.calvinist doesn't like that no Jesus.actually saves he didn't make salvation.a possibility well that's fine and dandy.that preaches well give me.exegesis deal with the tax it's right.there I didn't write Colossians see this.is my this is the problem was having as.a calvinist I had to explain a way a lot.of passages so quite clearly to answer.the sister's question there is no doubt.that everyone that God created he.desires their salvation no doubt about.it now how does predestination work.that's a topic that would require me I.cann't go into but it requires more than.a two-minute sound bite right because.then you have to talk about what is.actually being predestined who is being.predestined and what's relationship with.free will human.responsibility and in Christianity you.have various attempts of harmonizing it.it's not just the calvinist.understanding God has predestined.everything if you actually force a.calvinist against the corner and say do.you acknowledge God predestined even the.rape of a child they have to say yes.they will tell you yes because God has a.purpose now if it's biblical hey live.with it see if it's something biblical.and I can't okay man you know what as.hard as that pill is to swallow the.Bible says it I have to trust God cuz.his thoughts are not mine but a.consistent calvinist will tell you yes.even the raping of that child was.predestined otherwise it could not.happen but now let me tell you what.they're going to say but God didn't.force the rapist to rape the child the.rapist freely raped the child out of.Zone sinful inclination fine could he.have chosen otherwise no if it's.predestined that's what they'll tell you.no if it's predestined he had to rape.but did God Force no he did it out of.his own free will meaning his s because.they do believe in Free Will the freedom.to act consistently with your nature so.you have the freedom to act in accord.with your nature but your nature is such.you can't act contrary to it for example.I want to fly like.Superman if I go to a high high building.and I go up up and away Splat because my.very nature does not allow me to fly so.yes you have the freedom the free will.to operate within the limitations of.your.nature so when Judas let's say betrayed.Jesus he did it freely because as a.sinner his sinful heart desired to.betray Jesus and God didn't compel him.but could have Judas chosen otherwise no.he.couldn't and could God have stopped.Judas yes he could because in the Bible.you find God stopping people from.carrying out specific sins I'll give you.one example abik the king of Gerard abik.the king of Gerard Abraham was too.afraid to say Sarah is my wife so she.said she's my sister and by the way she.was his sister did you guys know that.she was a sister you guys looking at me.like you're angry please forgive me but.you guys know that Sarah was a sister he.says you know where he says it if you go.to Genesis 2012 he says she is my sister.she's the daughter of my father.different mother the yeah have sister.yeah she is my sister same dad different.M I didn't lie to you so technically I.was speaking the truth she's my wife.right Genesis 20:2 we got the same Daddy.not the same Mommy so I didn't lie to.you yeah but you forgot the extra detail.she's not just your sister she's your.wife oops but then just to tell you he.and here's a man called the father of.the faithful how cowardly he was in that.same Genesis 20 if you read verse 13 he.says I made a covenant with her if I.find favor in your sight don't tell.people you're my wife because you're.beautiful and they'll kill me tell them.you're my sister she agreed to.it I don't know if that sunk in ladies.Sarai who later became Sarah was willing.to be violated by men to save her.husband's life and her husband was.willing to allow his wife to be ravished.to protect his wife to protect his.life who showed greater faith and love.there Sarah or Abraham.Sarah I love you so much I'm willing to.be ravaged by another man to spare your.life but you don't love me enough to.fight for me and die for.me how many woman would stick around.with a man like that.today right and she did so we often.forget the faithfulness of Sarah why God.loved her see it moves me sometimes some.of these stories move me in my spirit.why God loved her and said she will be.the mother of the child of the.Covenant because she's a great woman.Abraham it's amazing God is good anyway.when abik took uh Sarah and right before.he sleeps with her he has a dream.Genesis 20 I'm not making up vers 1 to6.you're as good as a dead man you're as.good as a dead man because you've taken.other man's wife and he said will you.punish my people in my innocence did he.not tell me this is his wife he goes I.know this is why I kept you from sinning.against me this is why I kept you from.sinning against.me so God stop them what's the point.calvinist Who's consistent has to say.yes judas's betrayal that rap was.predestined God didn't make the person.do it but God did predestinate it so.that even though the person did it.freely he couldn't have he couldn't have.chosen contrarily so that's one view of.reconciling God's knowledge and human.responsibility there's another view it's.called middle knowledge molinism one of.its greatest Defenders is William Lan.Craig yeah one of his great middle.knowledge basically and Alex will.correct me here if I'm if I'm mistaken.God knows all possible universes he.knows how every person will react in a.given universe so if I put you in.situation A this is how you react if I.put you in situation B this is how you.react so God knew that this world is the.only possible world where he could get.the maximum number of people to be saved.freely because of the circumstance es.that this.universe would would we we' F find.ourselves in I'm trying to articulate it.clearly so this view says God knows all.things and he knows that if I want the.most number of people to be saved this.is the only world I can create because.there is no possible world will everyone.freely.believe so the only world I can create.where I can get the most number of.people to freely be saved is this one.and that's why God created it so that's.another view but there's a third view.that many people don't like it's called.open.theism the champion of this view is name.is Gregory.boy this view says God is infinitely.wise infinitely intelligent and knows.every possible choice anyone can make.given the situation he or she finds.himself or herself in but the future.does not exist there is no future it.doesn't exist so when this open theist.will ask you the question when you say.God knows the Future How It doesn't.exist so either he created it but if you.say he created it that means he also.created everything that will take place.in the future so you end up being a.calvinist right so how do you escape.that the future and the future decisions.of Free Will creatures are not.determined by God if you say he knows.the future because he created it that.means if he created the future he.created everyone in it and what they'll.do you're now a.calvinist for for knowledge does not.make you what does for knowledge mean.now I'm just telling you how I'm playing.Angelic Advocate what does uh for.knowledge mean means you're God okay.well what does it mean for God to have.forn knowledge there something before it.happens he had time and space means he.he can go anywhere which direction he.wants a time that doesn't exist or that.he created.it hasn't existed yet okay so then.what's them what's what's there for him.to Forno when it doesn't.exist when I get there I'll let you.exactly the point that's a very good.answer as well you can say I don't know.how God knows it but that's my response.and there's no shame in saying that you.know why let me tell you why what your.answer was very biblical and respectful.because there are things about God we.won't know so you can tell some.legitimately I don't know how he knows.the future he knows it without having.toate created and everything in it how I.don't know and I'm good with that answer.because the Bible says God's ways are.not my ways his thoughts are not my.thoughts as the heavens are higher than.the earth so is God's ways and thoughts.so I may not know but it doesn't mean.you're.right excellent answer.[Music].
