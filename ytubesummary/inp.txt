in this video Dr William Lan Craig and.Muhammad hijab discuss their respective.views on the coherence of the Trinity.this is a very unique opportunity to.hear from two well-known thinkers as.they unpack one of Christianity's most.intricate and debated doctrines let me.go ahead and pull them up on the scene.here so you guys can see both of my.guests Dr William Lan Craig is a.Christian and a distinguished.philosopher and theologian serving as a.research professor at talbat School of.Theology and professor at Houston.Christian univ University renowned for.his work on cosmological and moral.Arguments for God's existence Dr Craig.has engaged in numerous discussions with.both atheist and theist he's also.participated in Interfaith dialogues.with Muslim Scholars uh like shabir Ali.and now with Muhammad hijab he's also.participated oh sorry I've already uh.read that part his uh contribution to.one God three persons for views a.theological and philosophical dialogue.edited by Chad Macintosh highlights his.expertise on the Trinity making him an.ideal for uh ideal guest for today's.conversation joining him is Muhammad.hijab a Muslim philosopher of religion.and co-founder of sapiens Institute.Muhammad's.discussions representing the Islamic.Viewpoint philosophically politically.and theologically are among the most.viewed globally with 1.2 million YouTube.subscribers he is a significant voice.online providing Islamic perspective on.a wide range of topics additionally.Muhammad is pursuing his PhD at the.University of Birmingham where he.continues to deepen his studies in.philosophy and theology before we dive.into today's topic a quick word about.capturing Christianity the platform.hosting this discussion if you haven't.already please subscribe and hit

the end of September.we are launching our very first video on.miraculous Mysteries which is a sister.Channel dedicated to documenting the.most credible Miracle cases in history.so whether you're curious about.historical Miracle Miracles or seeking.evidence for God's existence miraculous.Mysteries is going to offer an in-depth.exploration and Analysis in a way that.you've actually never seen before on.YouTube if you're interested in that a.link to that channel is located in the.description all right back to today's.event we're talking about the coherence.of the Trinity is the concept of one God.in three persons logically cerent or.does it present fundamental.philosophical challenges so to begin.each participant will share their.positions on the Trinity they'll each.have three minutes for opening remarks.followed by a discussion period with two.minute timed responses as moderator I.will take a very active role in ensuring.equal speaking time for both.participants so let's begin with Dr.Craig's opening remarks yeah thank you.Cameron um it's a delight to have the.invitation to to be part of today's.Dialogue on the Trinity with Mr hijab as.you know uh ever since doing my doctoral.work in philosophy at the University of.Birmingham on the cosmological argument.for God's existence I've had a deep.interest in Islamic philosophy and.theology I was able to resuscitate the.ancient colam cosmological argument uh.which is now once again at Center Stage.and as a result countless Muslims all.over the world are following reasonable.faith and are appreciative of the work.that we're doing so when I went on to.Germany to do my second doctorate in.theology it was only natural that I.would choose Islam as my uh area of.specialization and it was during that.time that I worked through the entirety.of the Quan and studied Islamic Theology.and history and as I read the Quran I.was.surprised by the evident.misunderstanding of the Christian.doctrine of the Trinity that I found.there for example in Surah.516 Allah is portrayed as saying to.Jesus Jesus Son of Mary Did you ever say.to mankind worship me and my mother as.gods besides God and Jesus replies I.could never have claimed such a thing uh.indeed such a caricature of the.Christian doctrine of the Trinity is uh.a Blasphemous monstrosity no wonder.Muhammad rejected it if that's what he.thought the Trinity taught but I think.that the basic doctrine of the Trinity.is actually taught in the pages of the.New Testament itself and it consists of.just two fundamental tenets first that.there is exactly one.God and second that there are three.persons who are properly called God.whereby properly I mean literally truly.as opposed to metaphorically or.hyperbolically so that's it no.metaphysical mumbo jumbo no theological.Hair S splitting this is a simple and.straightforward Doctrine God is an.immaterial tri-personal.being now standing opposed to the.doctrine of the Trinity is the Islamic.concept of God and the doctrine of Ted.or the Oneness or Unicity of God and.this is a Doctrine which is very.confusing and very controversial among.Islam theologians there are a number of.different versions of Ted on which there.is no consensus for example the most.basic Doctrine would state that there is.exactly one God and that is a point of.being liting Dr Craig would you would.you like to continue your comments here.just to finish out your thought and then.we'll give extra time to oh you say I've.used up my time yes oh I'm sorry um yes.I'll just uh finish with the thought uh.that this is a very controversial.Doctrine it has a number of different.versions and so I'm interested in.hearing what is the version of Ted that.uh Mr hijab espouses uh and how would he.justify.that all right so Muhammad whenever.you're ready feel free to begin your.opening statement and you will get.another 15 seconds on top I want to.start off by saying thank you very much.to the organizers and to Dr William Lane.Craig for for this discussion to dive.straight into it the last comment that.Dr William Lan Craig made is absolutely.problematic uh it's erroneous in fact.the Muslims have never had a problem.discussing the Hess of God they have had.controversies surrounding the oness of.God but that's aside the point today.we're talking about the Trinity and it's.quite astounding that on a topic through.the Trinity that Dr Craig decided to.talk about which is not on the topic.today Dr Craig himself sorry to say do.does not even represent mainstream.Christianity when it comes to the.Trinity he attacks Thomas aquinus and he.can correct me if I'm wrong for example.he corrects Thomas aquinus on the fact.that he believes in one self theories.and he says that for for example if you.take the is of identification for God.and you believe in that uh the father is.God and the son is God therefore it.follows that the father is the son this.is his view of Thomas aquinus he also.says that the trinity.is against Divine Simplicity which.Thomas Aquin and other places actually.does espouse that's his View and he can.correct me if I'm wrong so that's I mean.Thomas Aquin is one of the Saints of.Catholicism and we're talking about a.great deal of people who follow that.obviously 50% of Christians are.Catholics he doesn't just take aim at.aquinus he takes aim at the the church.fathers he church he T he takes aim at.the church fathers Gregory of Nar.Gregory of nanus Basil he um clearly.states for example that they believe in.a kind of polytheism uh because if you.take the fact that the father is God the.son is God and the Holy Spirit is God in.a full sense that this is a kind of.polytheism so it's what what version of.of Christianity or of the Trinity is Dr.William L Craig representing he's.representing his own version ladies and.gentlemen he's not representing the.version of the majority of Catholics the.majority of Protestants the majority of.uh Eastern Orthodox and what he said.about the Quran as we've just mentioned.is erroneous he said that in chapter 5.verse.116 that the Quran depicts the trinity.in the wrong way the Quran doesn't even.mention the trinity in that verse and.you don't need to know Arabic language.to understand that because the Trinity.is not mentioned in chapter 5 verse 116.it says that did you say that you take.me and my mom as Lords Gods beside.God means God's subjects of worship we.do believe like Protestants as he claims.he is that Mary is venerated to a point.of worship that doesn't mean that she's.part of a trinity so he's got a.misreading of that and in my next.segment I'm going to talk about how he.opposes practically all of Christianity.with the Eternal begotten son Doctrine I.would like him to correct me if I'm.wrong in so much as I've represented his.views on oneself theories and the is of.identification and uh his views also uh.on the Church fathers and how he he.openly aim takes aim at them uh actually.to be honest with you so I think that's.my.time all right let's turn it over to Dr.Craig you've got uh two minutes for your.first uh response among Christian.trinitarians there are two very broad.schools of thought called social.trinitarianism and Latin.trinitarianism now Thomas aquinus is a.represent ative of Latin trinitarianism.and Mr hijab was quite correct that I.reject aquinus doctrine of Latin.trinitarianism because I don't think it.does Justice to the biblical data as I.say the biblical data teach that there.are exactly three persons Father Son and.Holy Spirit who are properly called God.and so those of us who are social.trinitarians uh take this very seriously.and literally that there are three.centers of.self-consciousness in God God is an.immaterial tri-personal.being and my claim is that this is the.doctrine that is taught in the New.Testament and as a Christian who.believes that uh Holy scripture is the.only inspired source and authoritative.source for uh Christian faith and.practice believe what the New Testament.teaches uh about the doctrine of the.Trinity and I am less concerned with.Conformity to uh later ecclesiastical.developments of that Doctrine so I'm.taking my stand on what I call the.biblical doctrine of the Trinity which.I've already stated now I do think that.the Islamic doctrine of Ted is very.relevant here because this is the.doctrine that is opposed to the Trinity.namely that God is absolutely one and.yet this Doctrine comes in so many.different versions does God have.physical parts does God have.metaphysical parts are all of God's.properties identical to one another is.God distinct from his properties is.God's Essence the same as his existence.Muslim theologians cannot come to.consensus on this doctrine of the unity.or Oneness of.God so Muhammad you've got another 10.seconds.10 seconds did you say oh sorry sorry I.meant like uh uh two minutes 10.seconds okay so Dr Craig has said that.he's he represents social trinitarianism.but he doesn't act represent all of.social trinitarianism for example he he.takes aim as I've mentioned at the.church fathers who represent a type of.social trinitarianism he States the.following given that there are three.hypas of God distinguished according to.Gregory in the in trinitarian relations.then there should be three Gods the most.pressing task of contemporary social.trinitarians is to find some more.convincing an answer to why on their.view there are not three Gods so in his.understanding William Lane Craig.believes that Gregory of Nissa who wrote.this book called not uh three Gods he.believes that this church father is a.polytheist this is a a social.trinitarian Doctrine will come to Dr.Craig's understanding of the Trinity as.parts of God and his mical understanding.However the fact remains that he doesn't.represent social trinitarianism he.represents his own version of social.trinitarianism which quite frankly let's.let's demographically of 100% Christian.population I would even wager than 1%.for what he believes in so that's the.first thing the second thing is he he's.talking about the Quran he agrees with.the Quran because he he believes William.Lang Craig believes he does not believe.in the Eternal generation of the sun.which is something in the Nan Creed he.does not believe in the generation of.the sun because that would make the sun.generated and caused and that is staple.Islamic reasoning the Quran says say he.Allah one and only Allah the eternally.besought of all is.self-sufficient he be gets not nor is he.begotten welled W William Lane Craig.believes the Islamic standard over and.above 1,500 years of Christian belief.because no one took his belief for 1,500.years of Christianity no one took his.belief that the the sun was not.eternally begotten and the Quran does.say that because the Quran indicates.that being begotten is an is an.inhibition on the necessity and.Independence of God so he agrees with.the Quran and he rejects the.Christianity as as the whole Orthodox.Christianity all right Dr Craig turn it.back over to you another two minutes I.want to reiterate that what I am.defending is the biblical doctrine of.the Trinity that is found in the pages.of the New Testament itself so of course.it's a version of uh social.trinitarianism there are many varieties.and no one takes the writings of Gregory.of Nissa to be authoritative for.Christian doctrine it's just one opin.opinion among many and my critique of.Gregory was simply that he didn't do a.very good job in uh answering the.questions about uh the three persons in.one uh being or Essence so uh I again.I'm going to be defending a very simple.version of the doctrine of the Trinity.that then can be elaborated in a number.of different directions for example you.can add to my model the Eternal.generation of the Son and the procession.of the spirit in the forthcoming book on.the Trinity you referred to Cameron.William hasker does exactly that hasker.and I see eye to eye on our model of the.Trinity except hasker adds this.additional element of the inter.trinitarian processions and that's fine.the reason I don't espouse it is because.it's not found in the pages of the New.Testament itself I am basing my doctr of.the Trinity on what the New Testament.teaches which is that there is exactly.one God and there are exactly three.persons who are properly called.God what I'll do at this point is I'll.just go back and forth and I'll I'll say.something if I need to but otherwise.feel free to just go ahead and take up.your time Mohammed.is itar US yeah can you hear us okay.tell me.yeah well feel fre yeah feel free to go.ahead right now okay yeah so Dr William.Lane Craig has not admitted openly to.the audience that his view of the denial.of the Eternal begotten son which is the.second person of the Trinity is a view.that was not held by all of Christian.Christianity for.sorry for can you hear me yeah yeah.sorry it's a view that has not been held.in all of Christianity for 17 until the.17th century the first recorded to my.knowledge to my knowledge the first.person who denied the Eternal begotten.nature the sun was Royal in the 17th.century so we're talking here about a.fringe opinion of a fringe of opinion of.a fringe opinion but what seems to be.interesting is William Lan Craig was.attacking the Quran in the beginning in.his in his first introductory statement.however he agrees with the Quran because.the Quran states that being begotten is.an inhibition is a dimunition is.something that inhibits and retracts.from the detracts from the fact that God.is necessary God is necessary God is.independent God is self-sufficient and.William Lane Craig admits this so he.disagrees with Protestant Christianity.he disagrees with Orthodox Eastern.Orthodox Christianity he disagrees with.the Catholic and he agrees with who he.calls Muhammad he agrees with the Quran.on this specific issue so this is the.first he has not admitted this yet why.does William Lane Craig not admit to the.audience that his view about the Eternal.begotten son is commensurate with the.quranic discourse and is in commensurate.with his with Christianity as a whole he.in fact attacks Nan Creed he talks about.well Gregory of n is not an authority.but the Nan Creed is an authority.according to Catholics and according to.Eastern Orthodox in fact they consider.it to be Dogma the Nan Creed itself is.that so he has to now admit to the.audience freely and openly yes you say I.believe what the Quran States is more.coherent than what Christianity said for.17th centuries please say.that all right so before we get to Dr.Craig I did want to make uh one quick.announcement about capturing.Christianity so our mission here if you.don't know is to explore deep.theological and philosophical questions.like the one we're exploring today um.we've been focusing more recently though.on Interfaith dialogues particularly.with Islam uh okay looks like you're.okay okay um so for instance we just.released a video with Gabriel s Reynolds.who is a top scholar of Islam where we.discuss the challenges that Muslim.Scholars face when defining theil so if.you're interested in these types of.discussions and you find them insightful.consider subscribing to our Channel and.supporting us on patreon your support.really does go a long way to uh help us.continue to bring high quality content.and explore these uh these really.important conversations so Dr Craig when.you're ready feel free to uh respond um.you've got two minutes I I I would like.to if we could go go to discussing the.uh logical coherence of the Trinity it.feels like we've been discussing uh.whether or not Dr Craig's views are.heretical or sort of unpopular um yes.which is not to say that they're false I.I'm claiming to be defending the New.Testament doctrine of the Trinity so I'm.not.denying uh Mr hijab the procession of.the son and spirit as I said you can add.that to my model if you want to but it's.not affirmed in the New Testament and.the earliest Church fathers didn't.affirm that Doctrine people like.ignacius Clement um and and others in.the uh in the post-apostolic age this.Doctrine originates in the so-called.logos.christology of the Greek apolog ologists.like athenagoras and Justin Martyr and.and so forth and I would follow them if.that Doctrine were to be found in the.New Testament but I think the majority.of Scholars would say this Doctrine is.not a new testament Doctrine and.therefore no Christian is obligated to.believe it unless he recognizes the.conciliar authority of these uh later.creedal statements that you mentioned.but as a Protestant I bring even the.creeds before the bar of scripture and.weigh them by their Conformity with.scripture now in terms of agreeing with.what the Quran says of course I agree.with lots that the Quran says I don't.maintain that the Quran is 100% false it.has all sorts of truths in it for.example uh that first uh tenant of the.doctrine of the Trinity there is exactly.one God uh Islam is a monotheism as is.Judaism and Christianity so I agree with.lots of things in uh Islam but I do not.agree with Ted that uh God is this.undifferentiated Unity as opposed to.three persons in one being a a spiritual.immaterial tri-personal.substance all right and Muhammad when.you're ready okay so this is what Dr Dr.Craig says he says for although creedy.affirmed the doctrine of the gener ation.of the sun and the procession of the.spirit is a relic of gloos christology.which finds virtually no warrant in the.biblical text and introduces a.subordinationism into the godhead which.anyone who affirms the full deity of.Christ ought to find very troubling so.it's very clear here that Dr Craig has.understood what Nan christology is and.he's essentially saying you've got these.Greek philosophers who've corrupted.Christianity and introduced a.subordination into it and now this is.not something found in the New Testament.for the Eternal begotten nature of the.sun I'm saying I agree with you Dr Craig.this is what I agree with you on but the.problem is this the problem is no one in.Christianity did agree with you until.her hernandes role in the 17th century.so the point we're making is if the.biblical text was so clear for everyone.to see how could it be that for almost.2,000 years nobody could detect what.you're talking about and all these.Church Farm from the ordinary language.of the text of the Bible understood the.Eternal begotten Doctrine in a different.way then the Bible then for is an.encrypted text it's a text that nobody.can access for 17 years until William.Lan Craig comes or roel comes or.somebody else comes and tells us what.it's meant to be this is a Preposterous.this is another problem you're adding.layers of problems to Christianity.you're adding layers of issues and.complications for Christianity now you.are talking about well we're not talking.about the incoherence of the Trinity.this is at part of the coherence of the.Trinity because most trinitarian models.as you know has inside of it or embedded.into it this idea that the sun is.eternally begotten you consider that to.be a subordination position what I'm.saying to you is if it's a subordination.position then the Trinity is incoherent.on many different grounds for example.when we talked about aquinus I agree.with your assessment of aquinus that.it's if you take the is of.identification that the father is God.and the son is God therefore the father.is the son The Logical law of uh.identification the law of identification.would be contravened so I agree with you.this is is at the heart of the coherence.of the Trinity so you'd have to say well.maybe half of the Christians of the.world are believing in an incoherent.trinitarian Doctrine no problem me me.and you both agree we have to.acknowledge that not all Christians.believe in the model of William Lane.Craig in fact I think seldomly anyone.does so this is the reason why I've.mentioned this point but we will go to.the heart of Dr William Craig's model of.the trinity in what will follow because.I do have my arguments against that and.I will present them uh to Dr Craig and I.I I I'm pretty sure he will not be able.to answer them in any coherent fashion.and he has not done any service to.Christianity this is not Christian.apologetics this is Christian.capitulation he's capitulated to the.Muslim argument we've gone uh almost 50.seconds over so we'll go 2 minutes 50.seconds for Dr Craig and his response.okay well I'm not capitulating to anyone.Mr hijab I am defending the doctrine of.the Trinity that is taught in the New.Testament and I am under no obligation.to defend later doctrines taught in the.uh 13th century by Thomas aquinus or.others I did mention the names of.certain Church fathers that held to the.New Testament Doctrine uh Clement of.Alexandria Clement of Rome uh ignacius.for example so it's simply not true that.um From the Beginning Christian.theologians have affirm these inter.trinitarian processions this arises.somewhat later in the logos christology.of the Greek apologist to repeat myself.now you have exactly the same sort of.doctrinal evolution within Islam you.yourself know that as a Sunni you.disagree with um Muslims belonging to.other schools with respect to doctrines.like Ted or the uncreated of the Quran.is the Quran a created product or is it.something that is co-eternal.uncreated and necessary alongside God uh.these are doctrines that develop later.in Islam uh and you are free to affirm.or reject them and there's great.controversy among Islamic theologians on.these doctrines so the fact that uh.Christians take a wide variety of views.on the Trinity is.unremarkable it's insignificant so long.as the doctrine of the Trinity that is.found in the pages of the New Testament.is coherent and is taught there and I.now await your demonstration that this.is an incoherent.Doctrine all right Muhammad when you're.ready.yeah so the difference between Muslims.and Christians in this regard is that.creedy and theologically Muslims have.disagreed on the whatness of God meaning.how is God the way he is but Muslims.have never disagreed on the Hess of God.who is God in in the first place how do.we understand who God is is God one.three is it tritheism is it is it sanism.is it.modalism these kinds of issues have.never Arisen in Islam all Muslims theila.the the the this ones that ones all of.the sh all of them agree that there's.one God so this is a failure if you want.to compare the idea that you know the.father Son and the Holy Spirit and the.Holy Spirit was only granted co-equal.coeternal status in that full sense.somewhere in the fourth Century there's.no equivalent in Islam I don't even.think there's much equivalent in many.other religions this is the first point.now I'm you said you awaited my you're.awaiting my demonstration you don't need.to await my demonstration you have.people like Scott Williams who have.already demonstrated this that you you.believe that there are three Wills of.the Trinity you believe that the father.has a will which is distinct from the.Son and you believe that the son has a.will which is distinct from the Holy.Spirit and they all have Wills that are.distinct from each other my question to.you is just one for now how do you.establish and this is the question of.Scott Williams in the in the.peer-reviewed academic paper how do you.establish necessary agreements such that.those those three persons of the Trinity.can never disagree this is my first.question to you to get the ball.rolling um you say that Muslim.theologians don't disagree about the.honess of God well of course it's true.that Islam is a monotheistic religion.and in the same way uh Christians agree.on.trinitarianism but the amount of.disagreement about the nature of God and.is attributes and so forth is just as.diverse in Islam as in.Christianity as for the Holy Spirit you.don't need to wait until the 4th Century.for him to be granted full Divine status.that occurs in the New Testament itself.as I've already stated now with respect.to the three Wills I think that this.follows from Divine Perfection you have.three perfect persons who are equal in.goodness omnipotence and.omniscience um and therefore it's.perfectly plausible that they would.always agree and uh would not come into.disharmony with each other so this is a.a Christian postulate that I think is.perfectly.reasonable Muhammad when you're.ready okay you've just said it's.perfectly reasonable but you've offered.absolutely zero.justification why so here's my question.if it's necessary a agement that is to.say and you know this you've written.books on the cam cosmological arguments.you know the modal distinctions okay if.it's necessary agreement that means it's.impossible for them not to disagree and.for you to say it's impossible well as.you know there's logical impossibility.and there's metaphysical impossibility.my question to you is how do you.establish the impossibility of.disagreement this is the question of.Scott Williams it's not just my question.it's the question been posed in academic.papers Richard swiber trying to answer.this question uh uh uh swinburn sorry I.forgot his name but swinburn tried to.answer this question and he said that.it's got to do with the relationships.between the father and the son yes and.that the father has a love relationship.with the son and obedience relationship.these are the lengths that theologians.of the the highest Eminence and of the.top caliber in Christianity have to to.reach to try and ex explain through the.three- will model which is a heresy once.again because you've adopted many.heretical positions it's a heresy let be.be honest and say this three- will model.that you now have to explain why there.is necessary agreement so you have yet.to demonstrate to the public how is it.impossible for them to disagree this is.my.question now it's important I think to.understand in doing theology the.systematic Theologian doesn't have to.prove everything some things are just.theological.postulates uh and the question would be.is there any good reason to disagree.with it and I see no reason to think.that the idea of three persons in one.being who always act in harmony with one.another is uh a difficult or incoherent.idea now again to repeat myself I did.give an argument uh for this from the.Divine Perfection you have three perfect.persons in goodness in omnipotence in.omniscience.and from that I think it's very.reasonable to think that these three.persons would always act in harmony.rather than disagree this is relevant as.well to the Christian doctrine of peric.coris which says that among the three.persons of the Trinity there is a.complete.interpenetration of mutual love.knowledge and will so that what the.father loves the Son and the spirit love.what the son knows the father and the.spirit know what the spirit Wills the.father and the son will and this.doctrine of peric chasis I find to be a.very attractive uh concept of the inner.trinitarian life of God and that would.again provide Good Grounds for thinking.that these three persons always act.harmoniously Muhammad when okay so Divi.you said Divine Perfection this is the.key term that you've used but in other.context you've in other context you've.accepted that go there has to be a level.of arbitrariness in God's decision.making otherwise it would lead to.necessitarianism and modal collapse so.if it was one Divine Perfection that was.that exists in within each of the wills.that would mean to say that all of them.really don't have a choice in the matter.in which case God doesn't have will.that's the first argument the second.argument is the following you've made.this comparison with.god with cerebus the the the the.three-headed dog and this is I mean if.if you can see on the camera this is.exactly what you've written in your.article that God is like a three-headed.dog you got one two three okay and just.as this one body and three heads you.know the Trinity is the same thing it's.one body and three different heads.that's what you've said now my resp my.question to you is as follows if you.have sies twins and this you've been.asked this once again before by Snider.on peer-reviewed journals if you have a.conjoint twin what person a person B.would you consider that to be one person.or would you consider that to be two.people this is my.question all right um I certainly think.that God has contingent properties and.that what God Wills he Wills.contingently uh in many cases for.example the will to create the world is.a free decision by God which is freely.willed so I'm not maintaining at all.that everything about God is necessary.and that he does nothing contingently my.claim is simply that given this peric.cortic interpenetration of the persons.of the Trinity they always act uh in.harmony with one another now the example.I used of kerberus uh Mr hijab I think.has been greatly misunderstood that is.not intended to be an analogy to the.Trinity that was meant to be a.springboard for thinking about what it.means to be three persons in one being.and so I uh thought of this mythical dog.in the uh labors of Hercules guarding.the gates of Hades which has uh three.heads so presumably three brains so.three states of consciousness of what.it's like to be a dog and then based on.that I endowed them with.self-consciousness and personhood and uh.my position would be that you have uh in.that case three persons in one being and.it would be similar with the camese.twins or triplets you have three brains.three centers of self-consciousness and.so three persons now in the case of God.he doesn't have a physical body so what.I argue there is that God is an.immaterial spiritual substance or.Soul who is so richly endowed with.cognitive faculties that he has three.sets of cognitive faculties each.sufficient for personhood and therefore.there are in God three centers of.self-consciousness and that would be a.model of what it is to talk of God as an.immaterial tri-personal.being Muhammed you've got 10 seconds.yeah you you say you say that this is.not an analogy but that's exactly what.you write in your article you say.perhaps we can get we can get a start at.this question by means of analogy that's.Mr hijab that's a springboard to.thinking about Dr Craig let's let's.let's let Muhammad finish his his.thought here I understand but you you.you you denied in your you denied in.your response there that this was an.analogy and you written in your written.work that this is perhaps we can get can.get a start at this question by means of.an analogy and then you mentioned Sirus.the the analogy so the point is this I.know it's difficult I know it's very.embarrassing I'm sorry to say I mean.comparing God to a dog anyway I mean we.wouldn't compare a prophet to a God but.let's say for the sake of argument we're.analogizing god with the with the dog.now I asked you a question which is that.if you have a conjoined twin Sim's twins.one of them commits murder we're going.to put both of them in prison one of of.them does something this dog here can.slick this dog this H can bite this dog.these are three different centers of.Consciousness why are we considering.this to be one dog only because it has.overlapping bodies this is a question.that was posed to you in the academic.literature we've heard your response I.have to say it's a very insufficient and.unsatisfactory response absolutely.unsatisfactory this is your model of the.Trinity I think this could be debunked.by children with all due respect this is.your model of the Trinity now going to.the part of you have to now maintain.that God is made out of parts and you've.said this you've made clearly you have.the view that God is part uh they are.parts of God no problem my question is.this who created the universe did the.father create the universe did the son.create the universe or did the Holy.Spirit create the universe who is.responsible for the creation of the.universe now on your model you cannot.actually say that the father created the.universe in a full sense if you do say.that then you can't say that the sun.created the universe in a full sense and.if you say that you can't say the holy.spirit because you can't have two.subjects operating on one object and.creating it and being responsible in a.sense I can't go to the gym and pump 100.kilograms by myself as well as my friend.over here or William Lan Craig doing the.same.thing it could be shared but then if.it's shared then you've got one-third.God so can you clarify do you believe.that the father is onethird responsible.for the creation of the universe or do.you believe in The Logical contradiction.that you have two two subjects that are.fully responsible for the creation of.the universe which one do you believe I.gave you an extra 20 seconds for the.interruption but Dr Craig it's now your.turn two minutes causal.overdetermination is not incoherent Mr.hijab imagine a candle being lit by two.simultaneous matches Each of which is.sufficient to um illuminate the candle.in the case of the Trinity the classical.Christian doctrine is in Latin Opera ad.extra Sun indiv.that the operations of the Trinity.toward the external uh world are.undivided and therefore undertaken by.all three persons at once now I don't.agree with that Doctrine in every case I.I think that leads to real problems but.I think that is very plausible with.respect to the doctrine of creation that.the three persons act uh in concert with.each other to create the world um so.they're all responsible for the creation.and in the New Testament creation is.ascribe both to the father uh and to the.son if they're responsible they can only.be responsible either in a partial sense.or in a full sense they can't be.responsible both in a part in in a.partial sense and a full sense you said.co uh causal overdetermination I'm sorry.to say you have not answered the.question the question is and you have.two subjects that are fully fully.responsible one to a degree of.100% fully responsible for the creation.of one thing in its entirety for example.can you have two mothers that are fully.responsible fully responsible for the.production of one child fully.responsible I think even the transgender.movement would raise their eyebrow to.this the LGBT they will say no Dr Craig.has lost it s to say no one could say.this can there be two authors that are.fully responsible for the writing of one.book could they I mean once again when.you when you talk about you don't want.to say this because I know it's it's.heresy it's a heresy to say that the.father is not the creator of the.universe 100% but that's what you have.to say to avoid contradiction so why.don't you say that why don't you say.that the father is not the Creator he is.a partial Creator he is a one-third.Creator he's a 33% Creator the father is.not fully responsible for the creation.of the universe is that correct I I.don't think you understand causal.overdetermination Mr hijab when two.matches light a flame simultaneously or.light a candle they don't each.contribute 50% to the lighting of the.candle they are each 100% sufficient for.the effect but they act concurrently.with each other uh and so in the Act of.Creation I see absolutely no problem.with saying that there is a concurrence.here of the action of the three persons.of the Trinity to produce this creative.effect okay so to respond to this very.clearly your candle example with.overdetermination caal overdetermination.it's complet it's this analogous to what.we are talking about why if you have two.candles that come together to light a.flame you will have a bigger flame you.see it's the sufficient condition all.the sufficient you've written this in.your book on logic you have a fantastic.book and I recommend it to the people.for children on logic.the difference between necessary and.sufficient conditions what is required.for the lighting of a candle what is a.necessary condition for the lighting of.a candle is not achieved with the.lighting of two candles what is required.for the creation of the universe is not.achieved with the creation with two.creators creating the same universe so.I'm saying it's this analogist because.we're talking about the flame and the.flame here is a product of the two.lights that you've talked about which is.a bigger flame I'm saying now each atom.each uh Quark each whatever it is in the.universe proton electron how is it.conceivable possible intelligible that.there can be two subjects that are fully.responsible for each of those things to.a degree of 100% how is it possible that.I can go to the gym and pump 100 kilos.and somebody else can pump the same 100.kilos how is it possible that a mother.can give birth to a child to a degree of.100% another.the production of the same child muhamed.this is these anal are the ones.analogist not to cut you off um but we.couldn't hear you the last uh 10 seconds.or so can you just repeat your last.point I I I I I said the analogies which.are analogist are for example how is it.possible I asked for there to be a.mother who gives birth to a child and.that she is responsible for that.production 100% And there to be another.mother for 100% responsibility why why.don't you admit that on your model you.have to say the father is not fully holy.completely responsible for the creation.of the universe he has to only be.partially responsible why can't you.admit that I I don't admit it because.your analogies are inept like two women.giving birth to the same child in a case.like that you're absolutely right you.cannot have.overlapping uh causes or cause.overdetermination but that doesn't imply.that there are not other cases such as.the illustration I use to show that.there can be cases of causal.overdetermination where three agents.work together to bring about a single.effect now every physical illustration.is going to involve points of disanalogy.when you're talking about spiritual.entities so the fact that maybe the.flame would be bigger if it's lit by two.matches instead of one match that's just.irrelevant to the question of whether or.not you can have uh two causes uh.currently acting to produce a single.effect so I'm I'm just not persuaded At.All by your.objection it's it's it's not it's with.with the greatest of respect but it's.not for me to be I mean it's not for you.to be persuaded with what I'm saying.it's really for us to be persuaded with.what you're saying because frankly.even Christian co-religionists of yours.don't are not accepting what you're.saying Scott Williams who wrote a.peer-reviewed paper and he was he was.asking the fundamental question about.necessary agreement and he gave a an.example which maybe we can move to.because I don't agree with anything You'.just said there I mean you talked about.the flame the the two the two matches.coming to to create a bigger flame but.that is clearly a different product the.two matches are different to the flame.there is not a single analogy that you.can bring which match the analogies that.I've brought forward which which show.the fundamental point which by the way.many of the Islamic uh thinkers and like.IB rush and arzi and others spoke about.this at length which is that you cannot.have two subjects that are responsible.fully for the same thing to a degree of.100% but the public will judge the.public will judge what who is right and.who is wrong on this and maybe even your.Christian Brethren will judge but at.this point you have not convinced.anybody the second point that you.mentioned yes he's got another minute.oh oh sorry you like to continue my.question is this now unnecessary.agreement yes if the father wanted to do.something let's say for example he.wanted to to take life away from William.Lan Craig and the son wanted to keep.life in William Lan Craig is it possible.that that can both happen at the same.time no it cannot happen is it possible.that both of them won't happen no.because that will cont contradict the.law of excluded middle the first one.contradicts the law of non-contradiction.the second one contradicts the law of.excluded middle is it possible that.William Lane Craig can have life in his.body without any reason no because that.contradicts the PSR the principle of.sufficient reason now the question is.this is it is the father capable of.supervening on the will of the son is.the son capable of supervening on the.will of the father is the father capable.of creating the universe all by himself.all right that's time without any.involvement from the son oh well those.are two different questions certainly.the father would be capable capable of.creating the universe by himself if he.wanted to and the sun wanted to what I'm.arguing simply is that there is no.disagreement among the three persons of.the Trinity nor is there any reason I to.think that this is impossible or.incoherent and in fact the position that.I'm articulating here is the standard.Christian position Opera add extra.indiva the operations of the Trinity.toward the external world are undivided.uh it's only the Opera ad intra the.intra trinitarian relations that are.traditionally.differentiated uh from each other so the.position I'm taking whether it's right.or wrong is the mainstream uh Christian.view it's not a peculiarity of uh.William Lane Craig's theology.no no no the position that you've sorry.sorry the position that you take on.partialism is absolutely not the.mainstream view I mean it's seen as a.heresy almost across the board it's seen.as a heresy across the board with.Protestants and Catholics and E Orthodox.to say that the the persons are parts of.God in the way that you've you've said.but put that to the side no problem my.my point is this let's go back to the.the thing that you've said you said it's.it's possible for the the father is.capable of creating the universe by.himself okay let's let's take that for a.second if the father is capable of.creating the universe by himself but he.does not create it by himself but.according to you creat it in concert.with the Son and the Holy Spirit these.are your words not mine in concert these.are the words you use yes that the.father is capable but no he does it in.concert with the will and the the Holy.Spirit the Son and the Holy Spirit that.means to say that the the addition of.the Son and the Holy Spirit have had an.inhibiting impact on the will of the.father that means to say that the father.is being inhibited by the and by the way.just to be clear this is not my.arguments this is exactly the argument.of the.Quran in chapter 23 verse number 91 that.Allah has not taken a son nor does he.have any creator with him if that was.the case they would have taken each part.of what they have created and they would.have tried to outrip one another in.power the reason why you are not able to.answer this question is because it comes.from the highest Source we believe it.comes from God this argument is a Godly.argument and this is why necessary.agreement on your model cannot there is.no real way to prove it you ask what is.incoherent about your model what is.incoherent about your model is that when.you look at it and you look at each.person of the Trinity and you look at.the father what he's capable of doing by.himself versus what he's capable of.doing the son of the Holy Spirit you.realize that he's capable of doing less.because of the son of and the Holy.Spirit and if he's capable of doing less.because of the Son and the Holy Spirit.that means to say that the Son and the.Holy Spirit are having an inhibiting.impact is not powerful then the father.has been stripped from his omnipotence.because of the Son and the Holy Spirit.there's no possible way that you can.have a part of God which is both.omnipotent in the full sense and in a.partial sense at the same time because a.part is by definition smaller than the.whole wouldn't you agree with.that that the part is not the whole.certainly yes but I I I simply don't.understand the objection that you're.pressing here I I don't see how the.Father the Son and the Holy Spirit.willing together to produce the same.effect is any imposition upon the.father's will or derides in any way from.his omnipotence I I think that your.argument is just a non seator.and as far as partialism is concerned I.think our audience uh needs to have this.defined I suggested that we could think.of the persons as parts of the trinity.in the sense that the whole godhead is.not just one person now you yourself.hold to a sort of doctrine of Ted that.involves partialism if I'm not mistaken.because you believe that God has a.diversity of attributes like omnipotence.uh.omnipresence um goodness eternity and.that God is not identical to his.properties neither are the properties.identical to one another but that they.are uh distinct and so this is the same.sort of um position that I've suggested.that a trinitarian could take if he.wants to William Lane Craig whether I.believe in the moon is made of or.whether I believe that I can fly it.doesn't change the Trinity it won't make.it into coherent because right now we're.talking about whether the Trinity is.coherent and you're talking about what I.believe you're talking about fallacies.and non secatur this is a twoe fallacy.if if if anything let's look at what you.said because you talk about the part of.the God because you do like to do this.you like to make analogies with animals.for Godly an anies with animals you said.a cat's DNA or skeleton is feline.even if neither a cat nor is this sorry.uh even if neither is a cat nor is this.sort of downgraded Oren attentuated.felinity a scat skeleton is fully and.Ambiguously feline so what you're doing.is essentially saying that the persons.of the Trinity are to God like a.skeleton of a cat is like to a cat and.that is different from what anything any.Muslim has ever said in the history of.Islam no you will not find a quote like.this from a single Muslim Muslim scholar.even the most extreme of them or the.most heretical from a mainstream.demographic perspective but the the.point I'm making to you is this if it is.the case that God or the father is a.part of God if the son is a part of God.and if the holy spirit is a part of God.how can a part of an entity take.responsibility for the actions of the.whole entity the creation of the.universe is one act how can a part of an.entity take full responsibility for the.creation of an entire act can you please.answer that question well real quick uh.we are coming at the end of our time.together today so we will need to.transition at this point to closing.statements okay okay no problem I think.the point has been made thank you so.before we do that I just want to uh let.the audience know really quickly that.after this debate tonight at 7M we are.going to be doing a debate review on.this channel make sure to check that out.we've got some special guests joining us.I've got it linked in the description of.this video as well with that Dr Craig.whenever you're ready sure I I want to.close by addressing uh personally our.Muslim listeners today I imagine that.most of you have probably been raised in.Muslim homes and perhaps even in a.Muslim culture and I think you would.agree that being raised in a certain way.doesn't provide a good reason for.thinking that that religion is true if a.Christian were to say that I believe.Christianity is true because that's how.I was raised you would think that was a.pretty weak argument in exactly the same.way I think many Muslims today are.beginning to ask themselves how do I.really know that Islam is true um and as.a result many Muslims are succumbing to.The Temptations of the new atheism and.to.agnosticism now I think that's wholly.unnecessary and unw I think there are.good Arguments for the existence of God.and so I believe that we should be.theists but the question of where you go.beyond that to what sort of theism.Islamic or Christian theism I think is.going to depend upon the person of Jesus.of Nazareth who was Jesus of Nazareth he.was more I believe than just a mere.prophet of God he claimed to be the long.awaited Messiah.the Son of God in a unique sense and the.Divine human son of man and he was.crucified for these allegedly.Blasphemous claims but I believe that.there is good historical evidence that.God raised Jesus from the dead and by.doing that he Vindicated in a public and.unequivocal sense the truth of those.allegedly Blasphemous claims for which.he was crucified and for that reason I.am a convinced and Ardent Christian.theist and so I would simply want to.invite you to begin to look at the.person of Jesus and the evidence uh for.him and his resurrection we have.thousands of resources available free of.charge on our website.reasonablefaith.org and I would invite.you to view or to read those um.resources and to ask yourself could this.really be true.um could the Christian God actually be.the true God and I think if you'll do.that um it could change your life in the.same way that it changed.mine all right and Muhammad when you're.ready I did want to just mention really.quickly that I'm so sorry we haven't.been able to read any super chats we.just haven't had time today we wanted to.devote most of it to the dialogue.between Dr Craig and Muhammad so uh.Muhammad whenever you're.ready the public will realize that Dr.William Lane Craig despite completing.two pH and in my opinion being the.foremost and the most prolific and most.influential most significant Christian.debater of the last century has.retreated from the entire discussion.altogether instead of talking about the.Trinity and summarizing his arguments.which he knows are feeble and that the.Christian population doesn't even agree.with themselves he started talking about.the resurrection and crucifixion of.Jesus Christ and he's gone into full.preacher mode instead of going into.philosophical mode and rational mode.which he was he made his career on.that's thing look I mean at the end of.the day the public will see and the.public will make their decision today.based on what we have said because what.we have done is we've dismantled Thomas.ofus together me and Dr William Lane.Craig yes Dr William Lane Craig is right.that the ident if you take an identity.few of God such that the father is with.the identity is God and the son is God.and the Holy Spirit is God in that sense.then that means that the father is the.son because that contravenes the law of.identity to say that it's not the case.and if you take the social trinitarian.view of Gregory of Nissa and these other.people which many of the Eastern.Orthodox believe that's already 60 or.70% of Christianity then according to.him it's polytheism so me and Dr Craig.done the work together to dismantle the.majority of the Christian faith and then.now we we talked about his view which is.the partial view really and truly and.we've seen how it doesn't achieve.necessary agreement we've achieved we've.seen through the quranic arguments how.the that the wills cannot they don't.always have to uh there's not an.impossibility for them to conflict and.what I will say is this he talks about.reasonable Faith I've been following.reasonable faith and that they've done.really good work with the atheist but.the sapiens Institute which also has a.which I work for cofound has a website.which is sapiens institute.org has a lot.of what you what he talking about.Christianity for Islam so if you're a.Christian listening to this and you.realize now that the Trinity is false.it's defun it's a rationally and.coherent Doctrine and you want the pure.monotheism the one God to worship.without this complication this father.son Holy Spirit Incarnation this that.the other then it's Islam that you have.to start looking into with with.sincerity if you are sincere if you are.sincere the whole problem is solved the.whole problem is solved sapiens.Institute the organ if you want.evidences for the rationality and the.truth of Islam then Muhammad hijab.com.has a an article of 10 of the evidences.of why Islam is true so the point I'm.making to you is that the argument have.been failed miserably by CRA he has not.been able to achieve even to the even to.the pleasure or the satisfaction of his.co-religionist a standard of evidence.that is acceptable uh for a rational.mind all right thank you do you mind if.we if I ask you guys one one last.question Dr Craig I know you've uh.you've got a short time limit here but.can I ask one question that might help.to to bring us back together so I sent.you guys these questions in advance but.I want to know what is one thing that.you like about the other person's views.that kind of encourage some more and I.like his monotheism we both agree that.there is exactly one God uh moreover I.like his denial of divine.Simplicity uh I don't agree with those.who say that God um is not complex in.his being.uh Mr hijabs Doctrine Ted which we.really didn't hear very much about.tonight um is not a Doctrine of divine.Simplicity which says that God's.properties are all identical that God is.identical to his Properties or that his.Essence is existence and so on that uh.we very much Concur and I appreciate um.that positive feature of his.view Muhammad what about.you I like Dr William Lan Craig as a.person I think he's done a fantastic job.and I and I've read almost every single.book that he's written uh maybe to his.surprise um but what I will say is uh.this I mean what I do like about his.views is his bravery in denying the.begotten uh the Eternal begot nature of.the second person yes on the one hand.he's rejected all of Christianity.Orthodox Christianity with with a small.case o he's rejected it but it takes.bravery to do so I have to say.intellectual and academic bravery to do.so and I particularly like it because I.agree with it how can you believe that.there is a co-equal co-eternal.son who has now been generated and.caused by the father this is a.contradiction and it's rationally.implausible in my opinion and it's.something we are taught as children as.5-year-olds and six year olds say is.Allah one and only Allah is.self-sufficient he begets.not he begets not nor is he.begotten and there's nothing like him.and this is the simple doctrine of what.it means the Islamic standard of.believing and worshiping one God that if.someone believes in they will be saved.they will be saved.well I appreciate you guys watching.capturing Christianity this debate um.feel free to uh continue watching our.other content and subscribe and uh if.you'd like to support us patreon.com.again links to that are in the.description thank you guys for uh.watching today we'll see you in the next.video hey it's me again uh actually.don't leave yet I've got something super.super important to tell you so first of.all you're awesome like you you just.watched a really really long video just.now and you're still watching it that is.actually pretty amazing secondly we have.hundreds literally hundreds of other.apologetics related videos for you to.watch on our Channel go check them out.I've interviewed exorcists hosted.debates between Christians and atheist.I've even made response videos to.atheist all of that is available on our.Channel go check it out third I rely on.people that see value in my work people.like you that watch videos to the very.end to keep the lights on around here.literally this is how I feed my family.so if value in the work that I do please.consider supporting this ministry and.becoming a patron links to that are in.the description oh and uh have I.mentioned that Christianity is true.
